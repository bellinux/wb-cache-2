5|$|The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution {{prevents}} Congress {{from making}} any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> or abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, {{the freedom of the}} press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on {{the freedom of the}} press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E

25|$|Religious groups became {{concerned}} that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection.

25|$|The Court {{recognized}} {{that under the}} First Amendment, the Congress cannot pass a law that prohibits the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> However it held that the law prohibiting bigamy did not meet that standard. The principle that a person could only be married singly, not plurally, existed since the times of King James I of England in English law, upon which United States law was based.|$|E

25|$|After the First World War (19141918), the {{teaching}} of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy.

25|$|The {{basis for}} dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, {{applied for a}} {{building}} permit to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in Boerne, Texas. The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> without a compelling state interest.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court never {{accepted}} {{the argument that}} the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the entirety of the Bill of Rights. However, it did agree that some [...] "fundamental" [...] guarantees were made applicable to the states. For the most part, during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, only First Amendment rights (such as <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and freedom of speech) were deemed sufficiently fundamental by the Supreme Court to be incorporated.|$|E
500|$|As {{described}} by Judge Louis H. Pollak in a 1999 article, Sawyer's [...] "theory {{of the case}} was that the prescribed Bible reading, whether or not followed by the Lord's Prayer, constituted both an establishment of religion and an infringement of the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in contravention of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment." [...] The trial began in 1958 before a three-judge panel. The panel agreed in an opinion written by Judge John Biggs, Jr. After the trial, the state legislature changed the law to allow students to be excused from the Bible readings if they wished. In further hearings in 1962 the court, again in an opinion by Biggs, held that the law still violated the Constitution by allowing the state [...] "to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth." ...|$|E

5000|$|Chapter V. The States; Section 116 of the Australian Constitution reads: [...] "The Commonwealth {{shall not}} make any law for {{establishing}} any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> any <b>religion,</b> and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 1997 case {{known as}} the Stolen Generations Case, the court upheld an {{ordinance}} issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families. The court reasoned {{that the purpose of}} the ordinance was not to prohibit the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> even though the ordinance may have had that effect. Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section116 will only [...] "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect". In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution was {{the product}} of a series of {{constitutional}} conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament. The first draft of Section116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws. At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate H. B. Higgins expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states. The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote. [...] Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the court}} found that the Church enjoyed the {{protection}} of the <b>free</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> clause in the First Amendment, and that it could use the [...] "ministerial exemptions" [...] in employment law to deflect litigation over its treatment of its members. The judge ruled that the First Amendment disallowed the courts from [...] "examining church operations rooted in religious scripture". Bringing the Church to account for how it disciplined its members was [...] "precisely the type of entanglement that the religion clauses prohibit." [...] However, the 9th Circuit did suggest that other types of claims would withstand appellate review, such as assault, battery or [...] "any of a number of other theories that might have better fit the evidence." [...] The ruling has effectively meant {{that it is impossible to}} bring charges against the Church based on claims of 'trafficking in persons.' As one attorney has put it, [...] "Here is a court saying, albeit in a civil situation... that there is nothing improper with this type of conduct and no ill motive can be imbued to the church." [...] Former US federal prosecutor Michael Seigel says that the ruling [...] "doesn't seem to leave much room for hope of success on a criminal prosecution".
