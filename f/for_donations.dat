5|$|Crusades were expensive, and as {{the wars}} {{increased}} in number, their costs escalated. Pope UrbanII called upon the rich to help First Crusade lords such as Duke Robert of Normandy and Count Raymond of Toulouse, who subsidised knights in their armies. The total cost to King LouisIX of France of the 1284–85 Crusades was estimated at six times the king's annual income. Rulers demanded subsidies from their subjects, and alms and bequests prompted by the conquest of Palestine were additional sources of income. The popes ordered that collection boxes be placed in churches and, beginning in the mid-12th century, granted indulgences in exchange <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> and bequests.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, consent from {{relatives}} is obligatory <b>for</b> post mortal <b>donation.</b> This study explored {{the perspectives of}} relatives regarding the request <b>for</b> consent <b>for</b> <b>donation</b> in cases without donor registration. METHODS: A content analysis of narratives of 24 bereaved relatives (14 in-depth interviews and one letter) of unregistered, eligible, brain-dead donors was performed. RESULTS: Relatives of unregistered, brain-dead patients usually refuse consent <b>for</b> <b>donation,</b> even if they harbour pro-donation attitudes themselves, or knew that the deceased favoured organ donation. Half of those who refused consent <b>for</b> <b>donation</b> mentioned afterwards {{that it could have}} been an option. The decision not to consent to donation is attributed to contextual factors, such as feeling overwhelmed by the notification of death immediately followed by the request; not being accustomed to speaking about death; inadequate support from other relatives or healthcare professionals, and lengthy procedures. CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals could provide better support to relatives prior to donation requests, address their informational needs and adapt their message to individual circumstances. It is anticipated that the number of consenting families could be enlarged by examining the experience of decoupling and offering the possibility of consent <b>for</b> <b>donation</b> after circulatory death if families refuse consent <b>for</b> <b>donation</b> after brain-death...|$|R

5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused {{a man to}} drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de Secours (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief materials {{for at least}} 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.|$|E
5|$|Having lost O'Rourke {{as manager}} in 1921, {{after he had}} {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} death of his son two years earlier, Bradford's results suffered back in Division Two. Both Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) had been relegated in 1922, and with the rise of fellow West Yorkshire side Huddersfield Town, attendances in Bradford dropped. City's average attendance fell from a record high of 22,585 in 1920–21 to between 12,000 and 14,000 in Division Two. Five consecutive bottom half finishes culminated in relegation to Division Three (North) in 1926–27, when they finished bottom of the table following a then record 8–0 defeat to Manchester City {{on the final day of}} the season. New manager Colin Veitch missed out on guiding the club to an immediate promotion when they finished sixth, but at the end of the season the players had not been paid and the bank was unable to advance any more money because of the club's overdraft. Had it not been <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> by fans, Bradford City would not have started the following campaign. A new board was appointed, and they reinstated Peter O'Rourke as manager. Success was immediate, when the 1928–29 season started with a record 11–1 victory over Rotherham United, as the side scored a club record 128goals to earn promotion by just one point. City's successful team had also brought the fans back and the average attendance of 18,551 is the highest average recorded by the club, since 1925, when The Football League started to keep official records.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{voluntary}} subscription, {{rather than}} funding from local or central government, {{was considered the}} only correct {{way to pay for}} a war memorial, although it was disputed whether active proactive fundraising was appropriate. Raising the sums required could be quite difficult, and many committees tried various means, including moral blackmail, to exhort larger sums out of the more wealthy members of the community. The amount of money successfully raised varied considerably: the city of Glasgow, with a million inhabitants, raised approximately £104,000 for memorials; Leeds, with around half a million inhabitants, only £6,000. A typical memorial monument in Britain costed between £1,000 and £2,000, but some could be cheaper still; larger pieces, such as the Royal Artillery Memorial, could cost as much as £25,000. Australian communities raised funds in similar ways to their British equivalents, but the process of fund-raising was much more open, and included directly canvassing <b>for</b> <b>donations.</b> Typical Australian projects cost between £100 and £1,000, with the larger memorials costing up to £5,000; bank-loans were also sometimes used. Memorials along the Western front, being larger, cost rather more than their civic equivalents; the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial, for example, cost the IWGC and Australian government around £40,000.|$|E

Authorities proposed to set up an outdoors emergency operations centre, as well as a public welfare centre to provide shelter to victims overnight. The Student Volunteer Army — which partook in silt shifting after the February 2011 quake — again prepared the recruitment of participants to initiate street clearing actions. A total of NZ$285,000 (US$230,000) was allocated <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> to nine charities, including NZ$40,000 (US$32,000) to both the Red Cross Christchurch earthquake appeal and the Canterbury Earthquake Appeal Salvation Army funds. At Westpac Bank, a public donation account was opened in order to provide financial assistance for earthquake victims. Chief executives from the Commonwealth Bank sponsored an exclusive dinner in Sydney to raise money for rebuilding costs; an initial A$700,000 (US$660,000) was allocated prior to the event, with entry costs of A$10,000 (US$9,500) per ticket.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, Singaporean police {{questioned}} Took as part {{of their}} investigations; he said that three Chinese men kidnapped the girl. After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go to the toilet, escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Took was charged with her murder. Direct Singapore Funeral Services oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy <b>for</b> <b>donations.</b>|$|E

In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, and the Mexican Red Cross asked <b>for</b> <b>donations</b> of such as utensils, flashlights, lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding. Following the hurricane, a riot in Santa Rosalía broke out {{due to lack of}} water. There was also a lack for shelter, as such this left many people sleeping in their cars. Within a week, the Mexican government assessed the damage form the hurricane, with 15 of them begin sent to Santa Rosalía and shortly thereafter, the Mexican Red Cross sent out relief efforts to the devastated area, especially in Santa Rosalía3.
