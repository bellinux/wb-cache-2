5|$|Rita {{takes her}} {{children}} Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey) to see Paul (Mark Pellegrino) in prison. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he was framed by Dexter—that Dexter dragged {{him out of}} Rita's house before drugging him and tipping off the police—and that if she could find his missing shoe it would prove his innocence. Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found it over a month ago. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night, she receives a call from Paul's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation.|$|E
5|$|As Doggett {{approaches}} {{the body of}} Jeb's latest victim, he has a flashback of when he found Luke's body. Doggett storms off, but Reyes refuses to let it go, finally revealing her theory: she believes that the boy's murder {{was part of a}} “thread of evil,” an interconnected series of terrible events. Meanwhile, Katha returns home with her daughter and finds Jeb there. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't him who committed the murder, and pleads to his sister for help. Katha calls the agents and tries to separate her daughter from Jeb, but he realizes what she is planning and uses his niece as a hostage. Before Jeb can shoot Doggett, Reyes incapacitates him with a round to the throat.|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie.

5|$|In class, Veronica and {{the whole}} class are asked to {{participate}} in Woody Goodman's (Steve Guttenberg) essay contest. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) invites Veronica to visit Hearst College. Logan abruptly breaks up with Hannah without giving an explanation, leaving her heartbroken. A student named Dean (Michael Cera) conducts Veronica and Wallace's tour of Hearst, and the pair suddenly run into Troy. Veronica mocks Troy to his face, but <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he has changed his ways. At a party, {{one of the students}} hits on Veronica.

5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E
5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E

5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E
25|$|The poet {{denies that}} his {{love is a}} form of idolatry and that the youth himself is an idol. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he has been {{constantly}} devoted to the values of fairness, kindness and truth. Being three themes united in the figure of the youth, there is great scope for verse, since they have never been united in one person before.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} {{sees the}} phrase as referring to vicarious baptism {{on behalf of}} dead people performed {{in the belief that}} the dead were thereby benefitted in some way. This belief is put forward as the reason why, when Paul compares the Corinthians' experience to that of the Israelites in crossing the Red Sea and being fed on manna, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> the Israelites were not thereby prevented from sinning.|$|E

50|$|Sahir was a {{controversial}} figure {{in that he}} was artistically temperamental. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the film score should be composed for his lyrics {{and not the other}} way around. <b>He</b> also <b>insisted</b> on being paid one rupee more than Lata Mangeshkar and this created a rift between them. Sahir promoted his girlfriend, Sudha Malhotra's singing career. <b>He</b> also <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> All India Radio credit lyricists.|$|R
25|$|A {{few years}} before {{the events of the}} first film, Michael had been engaged to a woman, named Samantha, before she dies in a tragic car crash, leaving Michael devastated, as he did not possess the type of medical {{training}} to treat her for her injuries before help could arrive. In the first installment, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he has no doubt in his mind that if he had known back then what he knew now that he could have saved her.|$|E
25|$|Carrie watches via {{satellite}} as a Special Operations team transports Brody to the Iranian border. The team encounters Iraqi Police officers who recognize Brody and open fire on them. The operation is endangered when the team's van hits a land mine, severely injuring the team leader and attracting enemy fire. Saul calls off {{the operation and}} orders Brody to turn back, but Brody refuses and runs toward the border. Carrie tells Brody that he will die on his own, but <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> she {{find a way to}} get him back safely. Fortunately, Iranian border guards take Brody in, saving the operation.|$|E
25|$|Cousin {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> they are a death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not {{go back into the}} water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
25|$|Mulch is a kleptomaniac, {{criminal}} dwarf who {{has been}} involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from 'Mud Men' Mulch no longer has any significant magic powers of the usual fairy, however he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American Dog' in The Arctic Incident. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.|$|E
25|$|As the {{deadline}} nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, {{resulting in a}} contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers {{to each of the}} contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer.|$|E

2500|$|Pius XI {{was known}} to have a temper at times and was someone who had {{a keen sense of}} {{knowledge}} and dignity of the office <b>he</b> held. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ate alone with no one around him and would not allow his assistants or any other priests of other clergy to dine with him.

But Fodor complains that Pinker, Plotkin {{and other members of}} what he sarcastically calls [...] "the New Synthesis" [...] have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> the mind is not [...] "massively modular" [...] and that, contrary to what these researchers would have us believe, the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model.|$|E
