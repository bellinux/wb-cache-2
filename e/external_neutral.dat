40|$|Augmented {{feedback}} {{has been}} shown to improve performance and influence pacing in various physical activities. However, few studies have investigated its effects on performance and pacing in striking combat sports. Additionally, despite the plethora of studies examining the influence of feedback in untrained individuals, {{there is a lack of}} research examining the effects of such feedback in trained participants. Considering the important role of feedback in training and competition, the purpose of this thesis is to examine the effects of three different but inter-dependent methods of augmented feedback on performance of combat, and resistance trained athletes. Study 1 examined the type and frequency of verbal feedback provided by national level coaches to their athletes during important competitions. A microphone was secured on the shirts of 12 coaches and the feedback they provided was recorded, transcribed and categorised into three common feedback themes: attentional focus (internal, <b>external,</b> <b>neutral),</b> autonomy support (controlling, supportive, neutral) and feedback valence (positive, negative, neutral). Collectively, 445 feedback statements from 12 coaches during 26 bouts, of which 14 were won and 11 were lost, were analysed. Coaches provided on average 8 feedback statements per round.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a {{range of}} work dealing with edge plasma transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas by means of predictive transport modelling, a technique in which qualitative predictions and explanations are sought by running transport codes equipped with models for plasma transport and other relevant phenomena. The focus is on high confinement mode (H-mode) tokamak plasmas, which feature improved performance thanks {{to the formation of}} an edge transport barrier. H-mode plasmas are generally characterized by the occurrence of edge localized modes (ELMs), periodic eruptions of particles and energy, which limit confinement and {{may turn out to be}} seriously damaging in future large tokamak reactors. The thesis introduces schemes and models for qualitative study of the ELM phenomenon in predictive transport modelling. It aims to shed new light on the dynamics of ELMs using these models. It tries, again making use of the ELM modelling schemes, to explain various experimental observations, notably the loss of performance and increased ELM frequency observed in experiments with enhanced toroidal magnetic field ripple and in situations with strong <b>external</b> <b>neutral</b> gas puffing. Finally, it also tries to establish more generally the potential effects of ripple-induced thermal ion losses on H-mode plasma performance and ELMs. It is demonstrated that the ELM modelling schemes introduced in the thesis can qualitatively reproduce the experimental dynamics of a number of ELM regimes. Using a theory-motivated ELM model based on a linear model of instability, the dynamics of combined ballooning-peeling mode ELMs is studied. It is shown that the ELMs are most often triggered by a ballooning mode instability, which renders the plasma peeling mode unstable and causes the ELM to continue in a peeling mode phase. Understanding the dynamics of ELMs will be a key issue when it comes to controlling and mitigating the ELMs in future large tokamaks. By means of integrated modelling, it is shown that an experimentally observed increase in the ELM frequency and deterioration of plasma confinement triggered by <b>external</b> <b>neutral</b> gas puffing might be due to a transition from the second to the first ballooning stable region, as expressed in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The result may have implications on the control of ELMs and performance in future tokamaks. Modest pedestal performance and benign ELMs observed in the presence of toroidal magnetic field ripple in dimensionless pedestal identity experiments between the JET and JT- 6 OU tokamaks are explained through predictive transport modelling as resulting from ripple-induced thermal ion losses, more precisely from non-diffusive (direct) losses. It is shown that ripple losses need not necessarily have a detrimental influence on performance, but that there is a trade-off between performance and benignity of ELMs. The results may have widely felt implications, because ITER, the next major facility on the way towards a commercial fusion reactor, is foreseen to operate with a non-negligible level of toroidal magnetic field ripple...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLinguistic {{studies of}} {{intertextuality}} and assertion pose {{the question of}} belief systems available to language users. Although not all utterances in a text are easily read as assertions, one can argue that all translated utterances are textual assertions. Still, {{the making of the}} Translated Text may benefit from various sources other than the Source Text. Using a hermeneutic textual approach, the present paper studies assertion in language and translation through examining the complex intertextual relations and sources which characterize the translator’s assertions. It studies George Sale’s English translation of the Holy Quran in light of three sources: ST sources, Marracci’s Latin translation, commentaries on Arabic sources, and personal communication. The paper reveals that the source of an utterance is complex and detrimental to the status of the assertions made by the source. The source can be (1) divine, (2) <b>external</b> <b>neutral,</b> (3) external adversary, (4) external opaque (unspecified by speaker), and (5) translator/interpreter. Assertion types relate to the source and show various degrees of commitment to truth: (1) divine assertion, (2) neutral assertion, (3) claim assertion, (4) counterclaim assertion, (5) translational assertions. Parallel structures, lexical choices and informational additions, show that Sale’s English translation made direct use of Marracci’s Latin translation. Sale also used a complex network of sources including Arabic speaking informants. The study shows that translational assertions are the translator’s own assertions, and hence, Sale’s assertions cannot have the power of the Divine Word of God. Still, Sale’s great contribution lies in interpreting his sources and in the creative formulation of a standard English translation...|$|E

Using a mediashifting protocol to induce submerged SpOrUlatiOn and brlA-lacZ as an expression marker, it was shown that carbon and nitrogen starvation stress induced brlA transcription to different degrees. Glucose starvation induced brlA rapidly to high levels and resulted in spore formation on reduced conidiophores, whereas nitrogen starvation induced brlA gradually to lower levels and sporulation occurred to a lesser extent but from more complex conidiophores. 19 -Galactosidase activity paralleled brlAa and mRNA. No clear qualitative differences between the two brlA transcripts were found in these starvation conditions, suggesting that the different patterns of sporulation could be explained by quantitative expression differences. Since brlA mRNA did not accumulate {{in the presence of a}} high glucose concentration, we investigated the role of other carbon sources on brlA expression. Nonrepressing carbon sources such as glycerol, acetate and arabinose were as effective as glucose in preventing brlA mRNA accumulation, suggesting that the glucose effects on brlA expression could be explained as a response to nutrient starvation, rather than by carbon catabolite repression. Despite similar low levels of brlA transcripts being detected during growth in glucose or non-repressing carbon sources, conidiophores were formed only in medium containing glycerol, acetate or arabinose. When mycelia were not shifted to starvation conditions, sporulation was not observed in standard minimal medium even after glucose was exhausted, unless the medium was buffered.

40|$|Rollover” cyclometalation is a {{particular}} case of metal-mediated C−H bond activation, and the resulting complexes constitute an emerging class of cyclometalated compounds. In the case of 2, 2 ′-bipyridine “rollover cyclometalation” {{has been used to}} synthesize the complexes [Pt(bipy-H) (Me) (L) ] (L = PPh 3, PCy 3, P(OPh) 3, P(p -tolyl) 3), whose protonation produces a series of stable corresponding pyridylenes [Pt(bipy*) (Me) (L) ] +. The unusual bipy* ligand may be described as an abnormalremote heterocyclic chelated carbene or simply as a mesoionic cyclometalated ligand. These cationic species spontaneously convert in solution, through a retro-rollover reaction, to the corresponding isomers [Pt(bipy) (Me) (L) ] +, where the 2, 2 ′-bipyridine is coordinated in the classical N,N bidentate mode. Isomerization is achieved at different rates (ranging over three orders of magnitude), depending {{on the nature of the}} phosphane ligand, the most basic (PCy 3) providing the fastest reaction. The mesoionic species [Pt(bipy*) (Me) (L) ] + contain two Pt−C bonds: the balance between the Pt−C(sp 2) and Pt−C(sp 3) bond rupture is subtle, and competition is observed according to the reaction conditions.

40|$|Experiments {{and theory}} show that tokamak plasmas with strong {{toroidal}} rotation and rotation shear can suppress turbulent energy transport {{as well as}} allow violation of the Troyon [beta] limit. However, using <b>external</b> <b>neutral</b> beams to inject toroidal momentum, as is done in many current experiments, would require a prohibitive amount of energy in larger, reactor-sized devices. The most promising alternative to achieve significant mean plasma flow that scales to large devices is intrinsic rotation, the rotation that is observed {{in the absence of}} external momentum injection. Intrinsic rotation is observed in current experiments, but is generated by effects that are formally small in [pi]* =- [pi]i / a, the ratio of the ion gyroradius to the tokamak minor radius. These effects are insufficient in anticipated reactors because [pi]*, will be significantly smaller. Recent theoretical work concludes that up-down asymmetry in the poloidal crosssection of tokamaks can drive intrinsic rotation to lowest order in [pi]*, [1, 2]. In this thesis, we extend GS 2, a local [delta] f gyrokinetic code that self-consistently calculates momentum transport, to permit up-down asymmetric configurations. MHD analysis shows that ellipticity is most effective at introducing up-down asymmetry throughout the plasma. Accordingly, tokamaks with tilted elliptical poloidal cross-sections were simulated in GS 2 to determine nonlinear momentum transport. The results suggest that the current experimentally measured rotation levels can be generated in reactorsized devices using up-down asymmetry. Surprisingly, linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations also suggest that tilted elliptical flux surfaces may naturally suppress turbulent energy transport. Using cyclone base case parameters [3] (except for an elongation K = 2), a 40 % reduction in the linear turbulent growth rate was observed by tilting the flux surface [pi]/ 4 from vertical. However, this reduction of energy transport was not observed when the background temperature gradient was increased by 50 %. by Justin Richard Ball. Thesis: S.

30|$|In this work, {{we carry}} out {{investigations}} of the dependence of the confinement time of an electron plasma on the external magnetic field in a different trap geometry, namely, that of the Quadrupole Penning Trap (QPT). The CPT geometry and electrode structure allows for trapping higher densities of plasma and combination of oppositely charged species, as in anti hydrogen production [18, 19]. The QPT provides for greater stability when fewer particles are trapped and thus has seen wide applications in tests of QED involving single ions [1, 13, 14, 20]. Unlike in the CPT, the QPT has electrodes that are hyperboloids of revolution. When {{a larger number of}} ions are trapped in a QPT, such as in our situation with electrons, it is of interest to examine the confinement time’s dependence on B and whether the B 3 / 2 dependence as seen in CPTs is reproducible in a QPT. Our measurements yield a confinement time, τ∝B 1.41. This is a departure from the expected scaling τ∝B 2 obtained taking into account collisional interactions alone with the <b>external</b> <b>neutrals</b> in the trap [9, 10, 16], and differs from the scaling law as in CPTs. As a complement to these studies, we have also measured the expansion rate of the plasma cloud, through a controlled variation of the trap potential. These measurements point to the influence of collisions as well as plasma diffusion in determining the dependence of τ on B. We have also carried out measurements with a trap where the internal geometry is altered. This sharply modifies the confinement time’s dependence on B suggesting that anharmonicities induced by geometric distortions {{play a significant role in}} determining the scaling law.|$|R

40|$|We derive {{and study}} distorted, five-dimensional, {{electrically}} charged, non-extremal black holes on {{the example of}} a static and "axisymmetric" black hole distorted by <b>external,</b> electrically <b>neutral</b> matter. The solution satisfies Einstein-Maxwell equations which admits an R^ 1 × U(1) × U(1) isometry group. The inner horizon remains regular if the distortion fields are finite and smooth at the outer horizon. There exists a certain duality transformation between the inner and the outer horizon surfaces which links surface gravity, electrostatic potential, and space-time curvature invariants calculated at the black hole horizons. The product of the inner and outer horizon areas depends only on the black hole's electric charge and the geometric mean of the areas is the upper (lower) limit for the inner (outer) horizon area. The horizon areas, electrostatic potential, and surface gravity satisfy the Smarr formula. We formulated the zeroth and the first laws of mechanics and thermodynamics of the distorted black hole and found a correspondence between the global and local forms of the first law. To illustrate the effect of distortion we consider the dipole-monopole and quadrupole-quadrupole distortion fields. The relative change in the Kretschamnn scalar due to the distortion is greater at the outer horizon than at the inner one. Calculating the maximal proper time of free fall from the outer to the inner horizons we show that the distortion can noticeably change the black hole interior. The change depends on type and strength of distortion fields. In particular, due to the types of distortion fields considered here the black hole horizons can either come arbitrarily close to or move far from each other. Comment: 39 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Delays are {{a common}} part of any contract, some are caused by the contractor, some by the {{principal}} and some by <b>neutral</b> <b>external</b> influences (eg the weather). Contracts apportion the risk and consequences of delays in various ways, but generally, the law requires each {{party to a contract}} to be responsible for its own actions. Complexity starts to arise when several different causes of delay are in play at the same time. What is the effect of an inclement weather delay if the contractor’s progress is already stopped awaiting design information from the principal? Normally the contractor can expect to be compensated for delays caused by the principal by way of extensions of time and delay costs but inclement weather delays are normally a risk borne entirely by the contractor or at best have an entitlement to a nil cost EOT. This paper canvases the state of the law dealing with complex delays and provide practical advice on the best ways of assessing and dealing with the consequences of parallel delays within a contract...|$|R
5000|$|The Stoics make {{a radical}} {{claim that the}} eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and {{everything}} else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely ‘neutral'. The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to Cynic philosophers such as Antisthenes and Diogenes in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one's family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later {{in the history of}} ethical philosophy in the writings of Immanuel Kant, who argues that the possession of a [...] "good will" [...] is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard <b>external</b> goods as <b>neutral,</b> as neither good nor bad, Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{simulations}} aimed at optimizing <b>external</b> heating using <b>neutral</b> beam injection (NBI) and radiofrequency {{waves in the}} ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) for high fusion yield in the JET tokamak. In this paper, D and DT plasmas are analyzed {{taking into account the}} NBI+RF synergy focusing on two different minority ICRF schemes, He and H, respectively. Our results show that by increasing external heating power to the maximum power available, the fusion neutron rate can be enhanced in D plasma by a factor of 2 - 3 with respect to our reference record D discharge. Regarding the DT plasma we present the external heating performance under the variation of key plasma parameters. We also study the impact of the effects of ICRH to the fusion yield and show that the ICRH power results in an enhanced fusion yield in the whole parameter space studied.

40|$|In {{its natural}} environment, Escherichia coli {{is exposed to}} short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic acid or propionic acid, which can be {{utilized}} as carbon sources but which inhibit growth at higher concentrations. DNA microarray experiments revealed expression changes during exponential growth on complex medium due {{to the presence of}} sodium acetate or sodium propionate at a <b>neutral</b> <b>external</b> pH. The adaptive responses to acetate and propionate were similar and involved genes in three categories. First, the RNA levels for chemotaxis and flagellum genes increased. Accordingly, the expression of chromosomal fliC′-′lacZ and flhDC′-′lacZ fusions and swimming motility increased after adaptation to acetate or propionate. Second, the expression of many genes that are involved in the uptake and utilization of carbon sources decreased, indicating some kind of catabolite repression by acetate and propionate. Third, the expression of some genes of the general stress response increased, but the increases were more pronounced after short-term exposure for this response than for the adaptive response. Adaptation to propionate but not to acetate involved increased expression of threonine and isoleucine biosynthetic genes. The gene expression changes after adaptation to acetate or propionate were not caused solely by uncoupling or osmotic effects but represented specific characteristics of the long-term response of E. coli to either compound...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and thermodynamic state {{of a system}} changes {{under the influence of}} <b>external</b> electric fields. <b>Neutral</b> systems are characterized by their dielectric constant epsilon, while charged ones also by their charge distribution. In this Colloquium several phenomena occurring in soft-matter systems in spatially uniform and nonuniform fields are surveyed {{and the role of the}} conductivity sigma and the linear or nonlinear dependency of epsilon on composition are identified. Uniform electric fields are responsible for elongation of droplets, for destabilization of interfaces between two liquids, and for mixing effects in liquid mixtures. Electric fields, when acting on phases with mesoscopic order, also give rise to block copolymer orientation, to destabilization of polymer-polymer interfaces, and to order-order phase transitions. The role of linear and nonlinear dependences of epsilon on composition will be elucidated in these systems. In addition to the dielectric anisotropy, existence of a finite conductivity leads to appearance of large stresses when these systems are subject to external fields and usually to a reduction in the voltages required for the instabilities or phase transitions to occur. Finally, phase transitions which occur in nonuniform fields are described and emphasis on the importance of epsilon and sigma is given. Comment: 25 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
