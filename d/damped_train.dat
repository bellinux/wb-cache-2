It has been shown that for wind turbines connected to a large grid an induction generator can reduce dynamic interaction.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of high-speed railways, vibration control for maintaining stability, passenger comfort, and safety {{has become an}} important area of research. In order to investigate the mechanism of train vibration, the critical speeds of various DOFs with respect to suspension stiffness and damping are first calculated and analyzed based on its dynamic equations. Then, {{the sensitivity of the}} critical speed is studied by analyzing the influence of different suspension parameters. On the basis of these analyses, a conclusion is drawn that secondary lateral damping is the most sensitive suspension damper. Subsequently, the secondary lateral dampers are replaced with magnetorheological fluid (MRF) dampers.

This research illustrates semi-active structural control of a three-story nonlinear building using magnetorheological dampers and a neuro-fuzzy algorithm. The structure being studied was developed for a third generation benchmark problem that is being investigated on a worldwide basis. A magnetorheological (MR) damper is tested experimentally and employed as a control device. An MRD- 300 kN- 240 MR damper, which is manufactured by the Sanwa Tekki Corporation, is tested in a controlled laboratory environment to obtain a set of experimental data. A model of the <b>damper</b> is <b>trained</b> and validated via an adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) algorithm. Next, an array of trained and validated MR damper models is inserted between the ground and {{the first floor of the}} benchmark building and numerically simulated under seismic excitation. To control response of the benchmark structure, a neuro-fuzzy control (NEFCON) strategy is applied with acceleration feedback. Training of a NEFCON controller is accomplished through use of an artificial earthquake. Next, performance of a fuzzy controller is validated by investigating time histories of the absolute acceleration response and the overall performance indices when the structure is subjected to a set of actual earthquakes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed semi-active control strategy satisfactorily mitigates absolute accelerations in comparison with response of the uncontrolled structure. In addition, performance indices indicate reduction in response of the structure in comparison with some passive-off and passive-on states of the control devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a state-feedback control structure for active <b>damping</b> of drive <b>train</b> torsional oscillations in a 10 MW ground test facility for complete wind turbine nacelles. It is the rotor inertia emulation requirement for hardware-in-the-loop testing of wind turbines that introduces a high dynamic performance demand of up to 20 Hz for the driving torque application. This bandwidth is well beyond the inherent torsional characteristics of the mechanical chain and therefore active vibration damping is necessary. Therefore, the drive train has been modelled and an estimation-based torque control strategy has been proposed, taking into account torsional behaviour of the drive train. The proposed framework takes advantage of a constrained model predictive controller (MPC), explicitly considering the actuator physical limitation, while the unmeasured state-variables are to be provided by a Kalman filter. For {{an evaluation of the}} proposed approach, simulation results are provided and analysed. Furthermore, experimental tests have been performed on a scaled test rig providing a realistic test platform. Overall, the results confirm the achievement of control objective and that the proposed structure is effective and executable...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} first {{overview}} of flows {{in the high}} latitude ionosphere observed at 15 s resolution using the U. K. -Polar EISCAT experiment. Data are described from experiments conducted on two days, 27 October 1984 and 29 August 1985, which together span the local times between about 0200 and 2130 MLT and cover five different regions of ionospheric flow. With increasing local time, these are: the dawn auroral zone flow cell, the dayside region of low background flows equatorward of the flow cells, the dusk auroral zone flow cell, the boundary region between the dusk auroral zone and the polar cap, and the evening polar cap. Flows in both the equatorward and poleward portions of the auroral zone cells appear to be relatively smooth, while in the central region of high speed flow considerable variations are generally present. These have the form of irregular fluctuations {{on a wide range}} of time scales in the early morning dawn cell, and impulsive wave-like variations with periods of a few minutes in the afternoon dusk cell. In the dayside region between the flow cells, the ionosphere is often essentially stagnant for long intervals, but low amplitude ULF waves with a period of about 5 min can also occur and persist for many cycles. These conditions are punctuated at one to two hour intervals by sudden ‘flow burst’ events with impulsively generated <b>damped</b> wave <b>trains.</b> Initial burst flows are generally directed poleward and can peak at line-of-sight speeds in excess of 1 km s^{− 1 } after perhaps 45 s. Flows in the polar cap are reasonably smooth on time scales of a few minutes and show no evidence for the presence of ULF waves. Under most, but not all, of the above conditions, the beam-swinging algorithm used to determine background vector flows should produce meaningful results. Comparison of these flow data with simultaneous plasma and magnetic field measurements in the solar wind, made by the AMPTE IRM and UKS spacecraft, emphasizes the strong control exerted on high latitude flows by the north-south component of the IMF...|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) dampers are {{adaptive}} devices whose properties can {{be adjusted}} {{through the application of}} a controlled voltage signal. A semi-active suspension system incorporating MR dampers combines the advantages of both active and passive suspensions. For this reason, there has been a continuous effort to develop control algorithms for MR-damped vehicle suspension systems to meet the requirements of the automotive industry. The overall aims of this thesis are twofold: (i) The investigation of non-parametric techniques for the identification of the nonlinear dynamics of an MR damper. (ii) The implementation of these techniques in the investigation of MR damper control of a vehicle suspension system that makes minimal use of sensors, thereby reducing the implementation cost and increasing system reliability. The novel contributions of this thesis can be listed as follows: 1 - Nonparametric identification modelling of an MR damper using Chebyshev polynomials to identify the damping force from both simulated and experimental data. 2 - The neural network identification of both the direct and inverse dynamics of an MR damper through an experimental procedure. 3 - The experimental evaluation of a neural network MR damper controller relative to previously proposed controllers. 4 - The application of the neural-based <b>damper</b> controller <b>trained</b> through experimental data to a semi-active vehicle suspension system. 5 - The development and evaluation of an improved control strategy for a semi-active car seat suspension system using an MR damper. Simulated and experimental validation data tests show that Chebyshev polynomials can be used to identify the damper force as an approximate function of the displacement, velocity and input voltage. Feed-forward and recurrent neural networks are used to model both the direct and inverse dynamics of MR dampers. It is shown that these neural networks are superior to Chebyshev polynomials and can reliably represent both the direct and inverse dynamic behaviours of MR dampers. The neural network models are shown to be reasonably robust against significant temperature variation. Experimental tests show that an MR damper controller based a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of its inverse dynamics is superior to conventional controllers in achieving a desired damping force, apart from being more cost-effective. This is confirmed by introducing such a controller into a semi-active suspension, in conjunction with an overall system controller based on the sliding mode control algorithm. Control performance criteria are evaluated in the time and frequency domains in order to quantify the suspension effectiveness under bump and random road excitations. A study using the modified Bouc-Wen model for the MR damper, and another study using an actual damper fitted in a hardware-in-the-loop- simulation (HILS), both show that the inverse RNN damper controller potentially gives significantly superior ride comfort and vehicle stability. It is also shown that a similar control strategy is highly effective when used for a semi-active car seat suspension system incorporating an MR damper.
