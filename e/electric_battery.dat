5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical <b>electric</b> <b>battery,</b> the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an <b>electric</b> <b>battery</b> and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} <b>electric</b> <b>battery</b> driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

25|$|In 1802, William Cruickshank {{designed}} the first <b>electric</b> <b>battery</b> capable of mass production. Like Volta, Cruickshank arranged square copper plates, which he soldered at their ends, together with plates of zinc of equal size. These plates were placed {{into a long}} rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves inside the box held the metal plates in position. The box was then filled with an electrolyte of brine, or watered down acid. This flooded design {{had the advantage of}} not drying out with use and provided more energy than Volta's arrangement, which used brine-soaked papers between the plates.|$|E
25|$|Motivated {{in part by}} a businessman's {{desire to}} {{quantify}} the economics of the choice, and in part by his scientific inquisitiveness, he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered Joule's first law in 1841, that the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences. He went on to realize that burning a pound of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of zinc consumed in an <b>electric</b> <b>battery.</b> Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise one pound, a height of one foot, the foot-pound.|$|E

While other teams were pouring their efforts into <b>electric</b> <b>battery</b> systems, Williams F1 opted {{to go down the}} flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators.

25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an <b>electric</b> <b>battery.</b> Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E

40|$|As use of {{electric}} vehicles has {{been expected to}} grow, the <b>batteries</b> for the <b>electric</b> vehicles have become critical because the batteries are {{a key part of}} the paradigm shift in the automotive industry. However, the demand for electric vehicles has been growing slowly and the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry still has internal and external competitions to become a standardized energy source for electric vehicles. The <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>batteries</b> will need to improve their performance, safety, life cycle, charging time and infrastructure to succeed in the market. Since the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry is associated with a variety of stakeholders, it should enhance its performance in complex internal and external competitions by cooperating closely with them. Automobile makers in particular are becoming competitors as well as clients to the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry. As automobile makers aggressively invest in <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> manufacturing, the internal competitions to achieve technology, cost, and market leadership are accelerating. In addition, automobile makers have developed fuel cell technologies for fuel cell electric vehicles. Since the fuel cell has the advantages in electric driving ranges, in charging time, and in vehicle design, the fuel cell electric vehicles could well restructure the entire electric vehicle market if they reduce fuel prices and establish charging infrastructures. The <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry should seek to speed technology advances for the next generation of battery technologies by identifying key materials, improve battery performance, enhance manufacturing capabilities, and reduce manufacturing costs by expanding the scope of its R&D. If it needs strategic partnerships, the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry should look for long-term strategic partners with whom it can grow together. Moreover, the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry should enhance its value chain by interacting with suppliers at all tiers from raw material companies to final product makers. Furthermore, the <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>battery</b> industry should seek to attain the economies of scale for the cost and market leadership by diversifying the batteries' applications. Finally, it should compete not on price but on value while strengthening the industry's power. by Young Hee Kim. Thesis: S.
