25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E

It would be like a king wilfully giving wrong judgment because the right side failed in some respectful observance. He was sure such a thing could never be. Did I ever know of a real case where Heaven did not show the right? It was confusing and alarming, for both those boys sat staring at me as if I could answer them; and those wonderful searching eyes of Leonard's were fixed, as if his whole acquiescence in the dealings of Providence were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the reply, that could but be unsatisfactory. I could only try plunging deep. I said it was Job's difficulty, and it was a new light to Leonard that Job was about anything but patience. He has been reading the Book all this Sunday evening; and is not De Wilton a curious introduction to it? But Aubrey knew that I meant the bewilderment of having yet to discover that Divine Justice is longer-sighted than human justice, and he cited the perplexities of high-minded heathen. Thence we came to the Christian certainty that [...] "to do well and suffer for it is thankworthy;" [...] and that though no mortal man can be so innocent as to feel any infliction wholly unmerited and disproportioned, yet human injustice at its worst may be working for the sufferer an exceeding weight of glory, or preparing him for some high commission below. Was not Ralph de Wilton far nobler and purer as the poor palmer, than as Henry the Eighth's courtier! And if you could but have heard our sequel, arranging his orthodoxy, his Scripture reading, and his guardianship of distressed monks and nuns, you would have thought he had travelled to some purpose, only he would certainly have been burnt by one party, and beheaded by the other. On the whole, I think Leonard was a little comforted, and I cannot help hoping that the first apparently cruel wrong that comes before him may be the less terrible shock to his faith from his having been set to think out the question by [...] "but half a robber and but half a knight."' ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{landscape}} change in central Italy. Landscape abandonment is analyzed integrating a transition matrix approach with a symphytosociological method.

However, a well-known shortcoming of most of these analyses is that their results are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> non-linearly <b>on</b> {{the extent of the}} area analyzed. Therefore, a landscape classification scheme is needed that provides ecologically meaningful units for quantifying different aspects of landscape mosaics and correlate them to environmental processes. Plant sociology has formalized one possible approach for classifying plant communities that is widely used in most European countries for vegetation-based descriptions of landscapes. In this paper, we propose a landscape classification scheme based on Potential Natural Vegetation distribution as a reference framework for quantitative landscape change analysis in a grid-based GIS. A mountainous region of central Italy was selected. First, two 1 : 10. 000 real vegetation maps (1954 and 1986) of the study area and a PNV map were produced.
