The {{reviewer}} felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV.

[...] The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike, saying they [...] "make for a far richer, more active playing experience."

IGN wrote the game was a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series, also citing a broader range of vehicles over Soviet Strike. Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game's predecessor, saying [...] "at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [...] It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same." [...] GameFan's reviewers called Nuclear Strike [...] "the definitive strike game" [...] and said it [...] "trounces all other Strikes that have come before." [...] Previewing the PlayStation version, Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects, missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series. In its review, the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games, but felt the control system, explosions, helicopter sound effects to be excellent. Next Generation said: [...] "Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike are certain to like Nuclear Strike even more", but said the games are almost indistinguishable. Game Revolution acknowledged the game is [...] "basically the same rehash of its predecessors, but it stands as a great game on its own.

Because of their autonomy and long-term, continuous existence, homo-clubs at Metelkova contributed to the consolidation of the gay and lesbian scene in Slovenia and significantly improved the opportunities for cultural, social and political expression of gays and lesbians.

2500|$|One {{cause of}} {{biphobia}} {{in the gay}} male community {{is that there is}} an identity political tradition to assume that acceptance of male homosexuality is linked to the belief that men's sexuality is specialized. This causes many members of the gay male community to assume that the very idea that men can be bisexual is homophobic to gay men. A number of bisexual men feel that such attitudes force them to keep their bisexuality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>and</b> that it is even more oppressive than traditional heteronormativity. These men argue that the gay male community have something to learn about respect for the individual from the lesbian community, in which there is not a strong tradition to assume links between notions about the origins of sexual preferences and the acceptance thereof. These views are also supported by some gay men who do not like anal sex (sides, as opposed to both tops and bottoms) and report that they feel bullied by other gay men's assumption that their dislike for anal sex is [...] "homophobic" [...] and want more respect for the individuality in which a gay man who do not hate himself may simply not like anal sex and instead prefer other sex acts such as mutual fellatio and mutual male masturbation.|$|E
40|$|Laws that {{restrict}} {{access to}} reproductive technology {{and fail to}} adequately recognise parent-child relationships in lesbian/gay families detrimentally affect not only individual {{lesbians and gay men}} interested <b>in</b> parenting, but <b>the</b> broader lesbian and gay community.

On the other hand, they contribute to the construction of all lesbians and gay men as non-familial and anti-family. Representations of lesbians and gay men along these lines have traditionally been central to the construction of lesbian and gay identity in Australia, as revealed by a survey of queer-themed Australian works of literature and popular fiction. If improving the status of lesbians and gay men in heteronormative societies depends on destabilising identity categories, practices that contribute to maintaining the integrity of lesbian and gay identity should be targeted for change. Reforming laws on reproduction and parenting should then be a priority for lesbians and gay men, even those who do not wish to have children. 24 page(s...|$|R

The female victim was made to tie up her male companion with bootlaces before being tied up herself.
