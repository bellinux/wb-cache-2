40|$|At large {{international}} airports, aircraft can be refuelled {{either by}} fuel trucks or using dedicated underground pipeline <b>systems.</b> The latter, <b>hydrant</b> <b>refuelling,</b> {{is considered to}} be an optimal fuelling method as it increases safety, shortens the aircraft turnaround time and cuts the overall costs. However, at smaller airports, implementation of this system can lead to high investment costs. Thus, the paper discusses the airport size from which this system may be efficient to implement. Various definitions of term “airport size” are assessed. Based on data collection, the hydrant system model is created within the paper. As a result, methodology for assessing the suitability of hydrant system implementation is set. This methodology can be used at every airport using three simple inputs...|$|R

5|$|The Tornado is {{cleared to}} carry the {{majority}} of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft's range.|$|R
50|$|With the Indian Navy {{becoming}} a one carrier navy, {{it not only}} operated the helicopters from aircraft carriers and destroyers, but also from its shore-based naval air stations. The operation with the Indian Navy revealed a major drawback of the aircraft, its limited endurance/range, the chief element of a Taskforce/Battlegroup. So, HAL was commissioned to experiment and possibly adapt a helicopter-to-helicopter <b>refuelling</b> <b>system.</b> Also, in the Indian service, the aircraft received Abris GPS system featuring a 12-channel receiver and option to employ Differential GPS references, designed by the Kronstad itself.|$|R
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>system,</b> the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|R
500|$|Completing the field, Kazuki Nakajima was 16th, Nelson Piquet Jr. 17th, Rubens Barrichello 18th, whilst the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella {{brought up}} {{the rear of the}} grid in 19th and 20th positions. Piquet later complained that he was blocked during his first-session run by Vettel: [...] "During my lap, Vettel was in front of me, which {{unsettled}} me a little, although the FIA felt that he did not impede me." [...] Kovalainen was, however, penalized by the stewards and fined €5,000 for using a <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> during qualifying which had not been approved by the FIA.|$|R

50|$|The SCT {{class are}} used by SCT Logistics on their freight {{services}} from Adelaide to Melbourne, Parkes and Perth. Locomotive SCT007 is named Geoff (James Bond) Smith after the CEO of the company. The benefits of AC traction has enabled a fleet of 15 locomotive {{to do the work}} of 20 DC traction equipped locomotives, three AC vs four DC units being needed on the Melbourne to Adelaide journey, and two AC vs three DC units between Adelaide to Perth. An on-train <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> carries 60,000 litres of diesel in a tanker behind the locomotives and eliminates the need to refuel en route.|$|R
50|$|Pressurised heavy-water {{reactors}} do {{have some}} drawbacks. Heavy water generally costs hundreds of dollars per kilogram, though this is a trade-off against reduced fuel costs. The reduced energy content of natural uranium as compared to enriched uranium necessitates more frequent replacement of fuel; this is normally accomplished by use of an on-power <b>refuelling</b> <b>system.</b> The increased rate of fuel movement through the reactor also results in higher volumes of spent fuel than in LWRs employing enriched uranium. However, since unenriched uranium fuel accumulates a lower density of fission products than enriched uranium fuel, it generates less heat, allowing more compact storage.|$|R

The F-4Cs were assigned to Escuadrones 121 and 122, Ala 12 (Wing). To support them a fleet of three KC-97Ls was acquired in 1972, equipping Escuadrón 123, being replaced by KC-130Hs (which equipped Escuadrón 301) from January 1976. While the KC-97s were fitted with a flying boom <b>refuelling</b> <b>system,</b> the Hercules that replaced them were fitted with the probe and drogue system and so could not refuel the F-4s.|$|R
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised <b>refuelling</b> <b>system,</b> developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|R
50|$|The {{collision}} with Pruett {{came at the}} climax of an impressive drive by Montoya. On his final scheduled pit stop at lap 44, a failure in the overflow valve in the <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> prevented his team from filling his fuel tank, requiring an additional stop on lap 54 to repair the problem and top off the fuel tank, with his returning to the track in 19th place. Montoya then took advantage of his having fresher tires than anyone else to move up to second place within fifteen laps, despite his advance being slowed {{by a number of}} full-course cautions, putting him in position to pass Pruett, leading to the incident mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 Fiesta {{includes}} Ford's Convers+ menu system, as {{seen on the}} Mondeo, S-MAX and Galaxy, and {{complemented by}} steering wheel button controls. Ford initially anticipated that over 85% of Fiesta orders would include this multifunction display. Other new equipment includes keyless entry with a 'Ford Power' starter button, reach and rake adjustable steering wheel, electric power steering, and a USB port for portable music players. Ford Easyfuel, the capless <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> recently introduced with the Ford Mondeo, {{will also be a}} feature, while 'ambient lighting,' casting a soft red glow over the interior, will be an option. For the 2011 US market model, the Ford Sync in-car communications and entertainment system will be available as an option.|$|R

5000|$|XM607 then climbed {{away from}} the {{airfield}} and headed nearly due north to a planned rendezvous with a Victor some way {{off the coast of}} Rio de Janeiro. As it passed the British Task Force it signalled the code word [...] "superfuse" [...] indicating a successful attack. Its journey continued within range of the South American coast to its rendezvous with a tanker. After contacting control with an update, the tanker was sent further south.To help bring the two planes together a Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance aircraft was flown from Wideawake to the area. Without an in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>system</b> it was unable to loiter long. XM607 made the link and was able to return to Ascension.|$|R
25|$|The first ATV {{was officially}} named Jules Verne on 9 April 2002; it was {{originally}} planned {{to be one of}} seven ATVs, and to launch in 2007. By the end of January 2003, most of its components had been assembled. These components were built by several different aerospace companies; the docking and <b>refuelling</b> <b>systems</b> were produced by RSC Energia in Russia, the pressurised section was assembled by Alenia Spazio in Turin, Italy, and the propulsion system was constructed by EADS Astrium in Bremen, Germany. The propulsion system was integrated with the pressurised compartment in Bremen, before the spacecraft was moved to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, for testing. It arrived at ESTEC on 15 July 2004.|$|R
25|$|The Adelaide Airport, {{located at}} West Beach, is Australia's newest and most {{advanced}} airport terminal {{and is designed}} to serve in excess of 6.8 million passengers annually. The new dual international/domestic terminal replaced the old and ageing terminals known locally as the 'tin sheds', and incorporates new state-of-the-art features, such as glass aerobridges {{and the ability to}} cater for the new Airbus A380. The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and it is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour. It was officially opened in a ceremony in October 2005 by Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson, Premier Mike Rann and Prime Minister John Howard. Due to problems with the new <b>refuelling</b> <b>system,</b> the new airport terminal was not used for interstate domestic flights until 17 February 2006.|$|R
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates.
