25|$|External HDDs {{remained}} {{popular for}} much longer on the Apple Macintosh. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a SCSI port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K, and Macintosh Plus did not feature a hard <b>drive</b> <b>bay</b> at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.|$|E
500|$|From 2006 through 2012, the {{exterior}} of the Mac Pro's aluminum case was very {{similar to that of the}} Power Mac G5, with the exception of an additional optical <b>drive</b> <b>bay,</b> a new arrangement of I/O ports on both the front and the back, and one less exhaust vent on the back.|$|E
2500|$|On the Slim and E models, {{the hard}} <b>drive</b> <b>bay</b> {{is on the}} bottom when {{vertical}} (right side when horizontal) and requires {{the opening of a}} concealed door to access it. (This does not void the warranty.) The Xbox 360 Slim/E hard drives are standard 2.5" [...] SATA laptop drives, but have a custom enclosure and firmware so that the Xbox 360 can recognize it.|$|E

Each module was limited to two CPUs.|$|R
50|$|These {{systems were}} {{packaged}} in two case form-factors, desktop and micro-tower. There were two variants of the desktop case, one with two expansion slots {{and one with}} four. Both variants had four <b>drive</b> <b>bays.</b> The micro-tower case had four expansion slots and four <b>drive</b> <b>bays.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{criticism}} {{also was}} due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still {{more expensive than the}} cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced.
