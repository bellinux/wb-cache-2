40|$|ABSTRACT Mean <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> {{size and}} adipose tissue cellularity were studied in 18 grossly obese girls and 17 age-matched {{reference}} girls. The obese girls had a combined hypertrophic-hyperplastic obesity with increments in <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> size {{as well as}} in <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> number. High insulin levels were found in the obese girls and the levels correlated with <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> size. The obese girls had higher serum triglyceride levels than the reference group but the cholesterol levels were similar. After dietary treatment and advice for increased physical activity of the obese group, both groups were re-investigated with respect to adipose tissue cellularity after 1. 5 to 1. 9 years. <b>Fat</b> <b>cell</b> number was unchanged in the reference group while the obese girls in spite of treatment increased their cell number significantly.

Newborn baboons were fed Similac formulas with caloric densities of 40. 5 kcal (underfed), 67. 5 kcal (fed normally), and 94. 5 kcal (overfed) per 100 g formula. From weaning (16 wk) until necropsy at 5 yr of age all baboons were fed the same diet. At necropsy, <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> number and <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> size in 10 fat depots were measured.

Understanding the molecular basis of adipogenesis and <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> development in obesity is essential to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets {{for the development of}} anti-obesity drugs. microRNAs (miRNAs) appear to play regulatory roles in many biological processes associated with obesity, including adipocyte differentiation, insulin action and fat metabolism.

The resulting heterogeneity of primary culture and the adipoconversion of the <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> precursors were studied in a serum-supplemented medium enriched with insulin (14. 5 nM) and exogenous triglycerides.

40|$|Background: Brown adipocytes are {{specialised}} in dissipating energy through adaptive thermogenesis, whereas white adipocytes are specialised {{in energy}} storage. These essentially opposite functions are possible {{for two reasons}} relating to mitochondria, namely expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) and a remarkably higher mitochondrial abundance in brown adipocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report a comprehensive characterisation of gene expression linked to mitochondrial DNA replication, transcription and function during white and brown <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in vitro {{as well as in}} white and brown fat, brown adipose tissue fractions and in selected adipose tissues during cold exposure. We find a massive induction of the majority of such genes during brown adipocyte differentiation and recruitment, e. g. of the mitochondrial transcription factors A (Tfam) and B 2 (Tfb 2 m), whereas only a subset of the same genes were induced during white adipose conversion. In addition, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM 16) was found to be expressed at substantially higher levels in brown compared to white pre-adipocytes and adipocytes. We demonstrate that forced expression of Tfam but not Tfb 2 m in brown adipocyte precursor cells promotes mitochondrial DNA replication, and that silencing of PRDM 16 expression during brown <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation blunts mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of brown <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> markers.

40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> biology is necessary to counter the epidemic of obesity. Although molecular pathways governing adipogenesis are well delineated, {{the structure of the}} nuclear lamina and nuclear-cytoskeleton junction in this process are not. The identification of the ‘linker of nucleus and cytoskeleton’ (LINC) complex made us consider a role for the nuclear lamina in adipose conversion. We herein focused on the structure of the nuclear lamina and its coupling to the vimentin network, which forms a cage-like structure surrounding individual lipid droplets in mature adipocytes. Analysis of a mouse and human model system for <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation showed fragmentation of the nuclear lamina and subsequent loss of lamins A, C, B 1 and emerin at the nuclear rim, which coincides with reorganization of the nesprin- 3 /plectin/vimentin complex into a network lining lipid droplets. Upon 18  days of <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, the fraction of adipocytes expressing lamins A, C and B 1 at the nuclear rim increased, though overall lamin A/C protein levels were low. Lamin B 2 remained at the nuclear rim throughout <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Light and electron microscopy of a subcutaneous adipose tissue specimen showed striking indentations of the nucleus by lipid droplets, suggestive for an increased plasticity of the nucleus due to profound reorganization of the cellular infrastructure.

25|$|<b>Fat</b> <b>cells</b> have an {{important}} physiological role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as determining insulin resistance.

This explains {{to a large degree}} why central obesity is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (even in the absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension). Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two, wherein stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat, which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes that contribute to heart disease and other health problems.|$|E

Ligament tissue mainly consists of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. Ligament cells differ in size, respond to different cues in the cell environment, and express different cell surface markers, limiting the number of clinical treatments for accelerated repair of ACL tissue to MSCs and primary fibroblasts obtained from other ACL tissue. Therefore, most modern stem cell injections use MSCs to promote faster repair of the ACL and allow people such as athletes to return to their previous form faster.|$|E
25|$|When {{the body}} is {{expending}} more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients, mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy.

For each age group studied, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks of age, basal (no hormone present) and hormone stimulated lipolytic activity were observed for two concentrations of epinephrine were used, maximal (10, 00 nM) and minimal (10 nM). Basal levels of glycerol were not linear. There was an increase between 4 and 8 weeks of age followed by a decrease between 8 and 16 weeks of age. The maximal dosage of hormone evoked a large increase in 9 lYcerol production between 4 and 8 weeks, which {{was followed by a}} decrease between 8 and 16 weeks of age. The minimal dosage of epinephrine, although not significant, showed a decrease in glycerol production from 4 to 16 weeks of age. <b>Fat</b> <b>cell</b> size continued to increase between 4 and 16 weeks. Both <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> diameter and volumes underwent a linear increase with age. However, the change was not reflected in epinephrine stimulated glycerol release. Therefore, glycerol release is inversely correlated with <b>fat</b> <b>cell</b> size during early development. The results indicate that age influences hormone stimulated lipolysis and is not dependent on cell size. Although the mechanism for the decreased lipolytic response of the isolated adipocytes was not discovered, it is believed that it may be due in part to a reduced number of receptors and to a reduced sensitivity of the cellular enzymatic system underlying lipolysis.
