25|$|As a third method, {{the radius}} of <b>gyration</b> {{can also be}} {{computed}} by summing the principal moments of the <b>gyration</b> tensor.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gyration</b> radius {{is useful}} in {{estimating}} the stiffness of a column. If the principal moments of the two-dimensional <b>gyration</b> tensor are not equal, the column will tend to buckle around the axis with the smaller principal moment. For example, a column with an elliptical cross-section will tend to buckle {{in the direction of}} the smaller semiaxis.|$|E
25|$|The space {{occupied}} by a polymer molecule is generally {{expressed in terms of}} radius of <b>gyration,</b> which is an average distance from the center of mass of the chain to the chain itself.

40|$|When a plasma {{is pushed}} across a {{magnetic}} field by some nonelectromagnetic force, ions and electrons get turned in opposite directions by the magnetic field. An exact analysis of that process is presented here for the internal region of the plasma. The energy provided by the initial push is used, in part, to create the electric field and in part to create some <b>gyrations</b> inside the plasma. When the rest energy density of the plasma exceeds twice the magnetic energy density (or when the Alfven speed is less than c), there will be enough energy to spare for the plasma to continue across the magnetic field at half its initial momentum. Two cases are considered: an impulsive start and a gentle push such as provided by gravity. The amplitude of the resulting internal <b>gyrations</b> becomes small in the second case. The frequencies of the <b>gyrations</b> are those of extraordinary modes of very long spatial wavelength...|$|R
25|$|Mathematically {{the radius}} of <b>gyration</b> {{is the root}} mean square {{distance}} of the object's parts from either its center of mass or a given axis, depending on the relevant application. It is actually the perpendicular distance from point mass to the axis of rotation.|$|E

As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The radius of <b>gyration</b> specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010.

Author Margaret Plant (2002) commented: [...] "With the lion of Saint Mark and the virginal city to the forefront, old sacrosanct Venice was propelled into a pop world of high-energy <b>gyration,</b> and endless circulation." [...] She also noted that Saint Mark {{was a symbol of}} a time when sexual crime was punished severely in Venice and acts of rape, homosexuality and fornication incurred the loss of a nose, a hand or sometimes life itself. Madonna appeared to challenge such brutality and stretch the boundaries of tolerance in the video. As the lion-man carried Madonna to the Venetian palace, it symbolized an instance of the Saint taking the simulated Virgin, where Madonna became a symbol for La Serenissima, the Republic itself.|$|E
