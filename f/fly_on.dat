5|$|At about 10 {{minutes after}} take-off, KAL007, flying on a heading of 245 degrees, began to deviate {{to the right}} (north) of its {{assigned}} route to Bethel, and continued to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> this constant heading {{for the next five}} and a half hours.|$|E
5|$|Cameron, Hadfield {{and other}} {{available}} crew members also {{spent the morning}} answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> the shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Stan Baker, an {{employee}} of Ampol Petroleum Company. In 1931 Mr Baker was booked to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> the fatal flight of the Southern Cloud but finally travelled by train instead.|$|E
25|$|Four {{pre-production}} machines. First <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 2 August 1968. The {{third was}} equipped to British Army requirements and assembled in France as the prototype Gazelle AH.1. This was first <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 28 April 1970.|$|R
50|$|Three main {{versions}} of the aircraft now named Flamant (Flamingo in French) were produced. The MD 315 ten-seat colonial communication aircraft (first <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 6 July 1947), the MD 312 six-seat transport aircraft (first <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 27 April 1950), and the MD 311 navigation trainer (first <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 23 March 1948). The MD 311 had a distinctive glazed nose for its role as both a bombing and navigation trainer.|$|R
50|$|The naval jack of the Philippines is a {{maritime}} flag representing Philippine nationality <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> the jackstaff {{in the bow}} of its vessels. It is also <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> the jackstaff of {{the fleet}} of Philippine Navy.|$|R
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|JAL Mileage Bank (JMB) is {{the travel}} rewards {{programme}} of JAL Group, including Japan Airlines, JALways, JAL Express, Japan Transocean Air, Japan Air Commuter, Hokkaido Air System and Ryukyu Air Commuter. The programme's airline partners also include JAL's Oneworld partners, {{as well as}} Air France, China Eastern Airlines and Emirates. For the airline's most frequent flyers, JMB offers <b>Fly</b> <b>On</b> Programme, a frequent flyer service status programme; and JAL Global Club (JGC), an exclusive club designed for experienced travelers.|$|E
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
50|$|The Mg 23 {{prototype}} <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 25 June 1955, {{flight testing}} {{leading to the}} increase in vertical tail size and a modified canopy on the production aircraft, the first of which was <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 1 April 1962.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prototype}} S44 Mystere first <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 16 November 1996 {{powered by}} a Rotax 912 engine. The second prototype S45 was {{powered by a}} [...] Lycoming IO-320 flat-four piston engine and first <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 4 October 2001.|$|R
25|$|Faced with {{a flight}} {{deadline}} {{of the end}} of September, Hughes' YAH-64 first <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 30 September 1975, while Bell's YAH-63 first <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 1 October. The second YAH-64's first flight was on 22 November, and second YAH-63 <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 21 December 1975. The first YAH-63 crashed in June 1976, but a static test prototype was brought up to flight standard and, along with the second prototype, entered the flyoff against Hughes' YAH-64s.|$|R
5|$|Pit is {{restored}} by the Spring, while {{the loss of}} Pandora's powers leaves Dark Pit unable to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> his own. Now restored, Pit attempts to destroy Hades with the Three Sacred Treasures, but Hades easily destroys them and attempts to eat Pit. After escaping from Hades' insides with assistance from Dark Pit, Pit is guided by Palutena {{to the home of}} the God of the Forge Dyntos, who crafts the Great Sacred Treasure after Pit proves himself in multiple trials.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), {{established}} independently in 1952, {{has only}} the plain sun disc as its emblem. This {{is the only}} branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an ensign to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> bases and during parades. The ensign was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The ensign contains the emblem of the branch centered on a blue background.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, McCudden made {{a formal}} {{application}} {{to become a}} pilot and <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing. His reputation as a mechanic had spread since his supervision in the unit had led to a record-low number of engine failures. He continued to fly as an observer despite the recommendation of his rejection letter.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} all the {{technical}} challenges and international debate and after extensive ground testing, the first prototype Concorde, 001, <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 2 March 1969 at Toulouse and the second, 002, <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 9 April 1969 from Filton.|$|R
50|$|Apollo 10, {{along with}} Apollo 11, {{were the only}} Apollo {{missions}} whose crew were all veterans of spaceflight. Thomas P. Stafford had <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> Gemini 6 and Gemini 9; John W. Young had <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> Gemini 3 and Gemini 10, and Eugene A. Cernan had <b>flown</b> with Stafford <b>on</b> Gemini 9.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 3 March 1967, {{fitted with}} Shvetsov ASh-21 piston engines, {{while the first}} production prototype <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 18 July 1968, using more powerful Glushenkov TVD-10 turboprop engines. The first deliveries to Aeroflot were in mid-1969.|$|R
5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{grounded}} from flying on operations, as his experience and leadership qualities {{were regarded as}} too valuable to risk further in front line combat. He did <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> occasional sorties, the most famous involving the shooting down of a Lancaster bomber of No. 44 Squadron RAF piloted by Warrant Officer G. T. Rhodes in April 1942, during a rare RAF daylight raid on targets in Augsberg. It was his 101st kill. In August 1942, the Geschwaderstab of JG 2 exchanged their Bf 109 F aircraft for the FW 190 A–2s.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys {{a matter}} {{transporter}} from Professor Frink. That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> his arm, thinking that he will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
50|$|Designation when {{powered by}} one {{prototype}} 772 lb (350 kg) thrust Turbomeca Marboré II turbojet engine and first <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 24 August 1951. A production {{version of the}} engine with 882 lb (400 kg) thrust was <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> 2 January 1952.|$|R
50|$|The X-56A first <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> 26 July 2013, {{flying from}} Edwards Air Force Base; twenty flights {{were to be}} <b>flown</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory before the {{aircraft}} would be handed over to NASA for further testing.|$|R
50|$|Two sub-orbital {{launches}} of the Mu {{family were}} performed {{prior to its}} first orbital flight: the 1.5 stage Mu-1 <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> October 31, 1966 at 05:04 UTC and the 3.5 stage Mu-3D <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> August 17, 1969 at 06:00 UTC.|$|R
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> the edge of its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability {{at the expense of}} top speed.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1942, Finucane {{was given}} command of No. 602 Squadron RAF at RAF Redhill. Five days later Group Captain Victor Beamish arrived {{as the new}} station commander. Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish frequently asked for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> operations but usually flew whenever he felt like it. Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which pictured the Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> longer routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E

5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|From 1987, Braathens SAFE {{was allowed}} to make {{international}} scheduled flights on certain routes. From 1989 to 1993, it opened routes to Billund, Malmö, Newcastle, London and Murmansk. In the same period, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. The Norwegian airline market was deregulated in 1994, and Braathens SAFE was free to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> any domestic and international route; it immediately opened routes to Harstad/Narvik. Within two years, international routes had been started to Jersey, Nice and Rome. In 1996, Braathens bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede Airways, and started a route to Stockholm. The following year, Transwede was merged into Braathens SAFE, and the airline took over its domestic routes to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, using Transwede's Fokker 100s. In 1997, KLM bought part of Braathens SAFE, and the two started a partnership; Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's hub in Amsterdam.|$|E

In April 2010, Wilson flew as a Mission Specialist on STS-131.|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{lifetime}} behavioral changes {{is essential for}} understanding aging and aging-related diseases. However, such studies are scarce {{partly due to the}} lack of efficient tools. Here we describe and provide proof of concept for a stereo vision system that classifies and sequentially records at an extremely fine scale six different behaviors (resting, micro-movement, walking, flying, feeding and drinking) and the within-cage (3 D) location of individual tephritid fruit flies by time-of-day throughout their lives. Using <b>flies</b> fed <b>on</b> two different diets, full sugar-yeast and sugar-only diets, we report for the first time their behavioral changes throughout their lives at a high resolution. We have found that the daily activity peaks at the age of 15 – 20 days and then gradually declines with age for <b>flies</b> <b>on</b> both diets. However, the overall daily activity is higher for <b>flies</b> <b>on</b> sugar-only diet than those on the full diet. <b>Flies</b> <b>on</b> sugar-only diet show a stronger diurnal localization pattern with higher preference to staying on the top of the cage during the period of light-off when compared to <b>flies</b> <b>on</b> the full diet. Clustering analyses of age-specific behavior patterns reveal three distinct young, middle-aged and old clusters for <b>flies</b> <b>on</b> each of the two diets. The middle-aged groups for <b>flies</b> <b>on</b> sugar-only diet consist of much younger age group...|$|R
