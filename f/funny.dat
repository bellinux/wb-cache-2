5|$|We write jokes, and {{the jokes}} are <b>funny.</b> With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not <b>funny,</b> then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of <b>funny</b> South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

The company, founded by Centaur Publications art director Lloyd Jacquet and later named <b>Funnies</b> Inc., planned to be a publisher itself, with Motion Picture <b>Funnies</b> Weekly as its initial product. While the postal indicia gives the publisher as First <b>Funnies,</b> Inc., the back cover, a house ad, directs interested parties to contact <b>Funnies,</b> Inc.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be <b>funny</b> if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very <b>funny.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really <b>funny</b> because it was not what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E

50|$|Bijou <b>Funnies</b> {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Mad magazine, and, along with Zap, {{is considered one of}} the titles to launch the underground comix movement. Bijou <b>Funnies</b> lasted 8 issues (from 1968 to 1963); a selection of stories from Bijou <b>Funnies</b> were collected in 1975 in the book The Best of Bijou <b>Funnies</b> (Quick Fox/Links Books).|$|R

50|$|Australia's <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos: World's <b>Funniest</b> Videos (also {{known as}} AFHV: Worldâ€™s <b>Funniest</b> Videos) is a {{spin-off}} to Australia's <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos which first aired on the Nine Network from 7 April 2009. The 30 minute show features clips predominately from the American version of <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos, and was hosted by former Australian rules footballer, Shane Crawford and former MTV Australia video jockey, Lyndsey Rodrigues.

It is the Australian counterpart to America's <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos, which was also created by Vin Di Bona.|$|R
5|$|Mann {{had prior}} acting experience, in the feature film It's Kind of a <b>Funny</b> Story (2010), {{and was told}} he could not {{audition}} for Project X because the producers wished to cast only people without acting credits. Mann ultimately auditioned seven times before winning the role.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently <b>funny,</b> the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be <b>funny</b> regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The Guardians TV {{and radio}} blog stated that Friends has {{impacted}} {{the creation of}} other television shows such as How I Met Your Mother. The similarities between the two consist of both sitcoms taking place in Manhattan, a group of white adults who are <b>funny</b> and have similar character traits.|$|E

50|$|Like America's <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos, America's <b>Funniest</b> People {{featured}} a contest for <b>funniest</b> video, {{with the first}} prize winner receiving $10,000 and the 2nd and 3rd prize winners receiving $3,000 and $2,000 respectively. However, unlike <b>Funniest</b> Home Videos, which relied on studio audience voting to determine the winner, <b>Funniest</b> People selected its winners via telephone vote for its first five episodes, with the winners announced {{at the beginning of}} the next show; the show switched to having the studio audience select the winner afterwards, like its parent show. Also, unlike its parent show, there was no $100,000 grand prize finale.|$|R
5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove jokes and dialogue. Curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being <b>funny,</b> then it was never put back.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the {{excavation}} {{of the parking}} lot for the parking structures. It opened on November 19, 2004 with Marquee Cinemas. Others, such as Empire Books & News, EB Games and Starbucks, opened in early December. In June 2005, the <b>Funny</b> Bone Comedy Club opened, followed by Cold Stone Creamery in July and pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill and Max & Erma's in August.|$|E
5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series <b>funny</b> later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

5000|$|Marvel Comics, in 1978, {{describing}} {{the creation of}} its superhero the Sub-Mariner, wrote Sub-Mariner's first story, eight pages long, was written, penciled, inked and lettered by the late William Blake [...] "Bill" [...] Everett, for publication in the pilot issue of a small giveaway comic book titled Motion Picture <b>Funnies</b> Weekly. This comic was the first item produced by the Lloyd V. Jacquet art shop, <b>Funnies,</b> Inc. (then called First <b>Funnies,</b> Inc.); the Sub-Mariner story was dated April 1939. It {{was the idea of}} those who operated <b>Funnies,</b> Inc. to distribute Motion Picture <b>Funnies</b> Weekly through movie theaters to attract customers. Apparently the theater owners thought little of the venture and the project was unsuccessful.|$|R
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as <b>funny,</b> extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusionsâ€”often very <b>funny</b> onesâ€”and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Skelton {{made several}} {{specials}} for HBO including Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner (1981) and the <b>Funny</b> Faces series of specials.
