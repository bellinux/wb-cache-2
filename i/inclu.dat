Nevertheless, there has been growing attention to the development of more powerful and elegant human-computer interfaces, with new interaction modalities, including the use of perspective-following simulation and telepresence. I shall describe several promising directions and opportunities surrounding the human-computer interface in computer-based medical systems. I shall first discuss the form of decision support that might someday be accessed regularly during the practice of medicine. Then, I will describe the utility-directed display of information, intelligent user-modeling, and information sharing.

40|$|PTSD’s most {{distinctive}} feature is its etiological event. With-out this event, PTSD symptoms are indistinguishable from symptoms associated with combinations of other psychiatric diagnoses. The DSM definition of PTSD {{assumes that the}} relation between the etiological event and its symptoms is equivalent to a cause and effect. In reality, these events are often reasons rather than causes of the syndrome. Where this is true, the syndrome loses its specificity. This paper explains why it is often impossible to distinguish between the reasons and causes of PTSD, and why this difficulty is generally ignored. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entered the official psychiatric nosology (DIM- 111) in 1980. While PTSD is connected genealogically to earlier diagnoses, such as &dquo;railway spine&dquo; (19 th-century), &dquo;shell shock&dquo; (World War I) and &dquo;gross stress reaction&dquo; (DSM-I), its <b>inclu...</b>|$|E
