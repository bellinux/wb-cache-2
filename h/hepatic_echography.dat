40|$|ObjectivesPatients {{may develop}} liver dysfunction, {{including}} liver fibrosis, {{over the long}} term following Fontan procedure. Therefore, early detection of liver dysfunction is essential to identify those patients who are at risk. We evaluated various laboratory parameters, including liver biochemical markers, <b>hepatic</b> <b>echography</b> findings, and cardiac catheterization outcomes, at an early stage after undergoing Fontan procedure. MethodsA total of 56 patients who underwent Fontan procedure were included in the study. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization and biochemical markers were evaluated from the samples. Abdominal echography was performed on a subgroup of patients (n =  20) to observe the structure of liver tissues and to measure blood flow in the hepatic vein, portal vein, and hepatic artery. ResultsThe mean period of time since Fontan procedure was 2. 8 ± 2. 1 years. There was a significant correlation between venous pressure and serum levels of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase and type IV collagen 7 s domain, which indicated a high probability of liver consolidation. The other biochemical markers were normal. Stepwise regression analyses suggested that by using the ratio of hepatic venous flow and type IV collagen 7 s collagen domain concentration, inferior vena cava pressure can be predicted. ConclusionsOur study showed that we can predict inferior vena cava pressure using noninvasive abdominal echography and biochemical markers at an early stage after Fontan procedure...|$|E
40|$|When facing any {{vascular}} lesion {{present in the}} first moments of life, {{it is necessary to}} determine whether one is dealing with a tumour or a vascular malformation, given the different evolution of both processes and, hence, the different treatments they require. Diagnosis is basically clinical, based on a correct anamnesis and a detailed physical exploration. The first thing is to establish whether the lesion was present at birth and has changed size significantly, which would lead one to think of a haemangioma or, on the contrary, whether it is congenital and of very slow growth, such as vascular malformations. Facing dubious lesions, it is recommendable to carry out a biopsy with immunohistochemistry for the GLUT- 1 antibody, specific to haemangiomas. Amongst the image tests, the first choice is usually ecography-Doppler, which makes it possible to determine whether the lesion is of high or low flow and to distinguish whether one is dealing with a haemangioma or a vascular malformation. Depending on the type of lesion, its localisation and degree of affectation it might be necessary to carry out radiography, magnetic resonance, phlebography, angio-resonance, arteriography or lymphoscintigraphy to complete the study. In more particular cases, such as multiple haemangiomatosis, it is necessary to carry out an <b>hepatic</b> <b>echography,</b> blood concealed in faeces, gastroscopy and colonoscopy, as well a determination of thyroid hormones; and in venous or combined extensive malformations, a haemogram and coagulation tests. On the other hand, the possible repercussions on other organs make a multidisciplinary approach essential, with the participation of different specialists. Due to the wide spectrum covered by vascular anomalies, treatment must be individualised...|$|E
40|$|Se presenta un caso de un hombre de 81 años natural de zona rural, agricultor, recolector de café 50 años atrás y jardinero por 22 años en Bogotá. Consultó por dolor {{abdominal}} de 10 días de evolución, localizado hacia mesogastrio y epigastrio. Además, disnea, tos productiva. Antecedentes: enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica, cor pulmonale, fumador de 25 paquetes /año, había recibido prednisona oral y beclometasona inhalada en diversas ocasiones incluso en la última hospitalización. En el examen físico presentó signos de desnutrición, taquicardia, taquipnea; estertores en base del hemitórax derecho; abdomen: blando, depresible con dolor a la palpación profunda en epigastrio e hipocondrio derecho. Ingresó con síndrome de respuesta inflamatoria sistémica por taquicardia, taquipnea, leucocitosis 37. 600 y eosinofilia 52 - 60 %, Ig E: 180 UI/ ml. Se evidenciaron larvas rabditiformes de Strongyloides stercoralis en esputo y materia fecal. La radiografía de tórax mostró derrame pleural derecho, la ecografía hepática fue normal, la endoscopia de vías digestivas altas evidenció gastritis y duodenitis. Se inició tratamiento con ivermectina 200 mg/ Kg/dosis, con seguimiento clínico y de laboratorio con evolución clínica satisfactoria. The case {{is presented}} of an 81 -years old man from {{a rural area}} {{who had been a}} farmer, a coffee harvester 50 years beforehand and a gardener in Bogotá for 22 years. He consulted because of abdominal pain having 10 days’ evolution, localized towards the mesogastrium and epigastrium. He was also suffering from dyspnoea and productive cough. Background: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking 25 packets/year, he had received oral prednisone and inhaled beclomethasone on occasions, including during his last hospitalization. Physical examination revealed signs of undernourishment, tachycardia, tachypnoea; stertors {{at the base of the}} right hemithorax; abdomen: soft, depressible with pain on deep palpation of the epigastrium and right hypochondrium. He was admitted suffering from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) dueto tachycardia, tachypnoea, 37, 600 leukocytosis and 52 %- 60 % eosinophilia, Ig E: 180 UI/ ml. Strongyloides stercoralis rabditiform larvae appeared in sputum and fecal material. Thoracic radiography revealed right pleural leakage; <b>hepatic</b> <b>echography</b> was normal, endoscopy of upper digestive routes revealed gastritis and duodenitis. Treatment was started with 200 mg/Kg/dose ivermectin with clinical and laboratory follow-up and satisfactory clinical evolution...|$|E
