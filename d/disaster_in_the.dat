5|$|In all, Liza {{brought a}} total of $100million in damage in Baja California Sur, which {{receives}} catastrophic flooding from hurricanes every 50years or so. The hurricane was considered the worst natural <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the peninsula, {{which at the time}} held 130,000 occupants. Furthermore, Liza was at that time considered the worst hurricane to affect the entire country in the 20th century.|$|E

About {{a month after the}} storm passed, President Ronald Reagan declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a major disaster area. The declaration permitted use of federal funds for recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided an average relief fund of $2,128 (1984USD, $4,147 2006USD) per affected person, the smallest return rate for a declared <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Virginia {{proved to be}} the costliest <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Virginia. Hurricane Isabel formed from a {{tropical}} wave on September 6, 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265km/h (165mph) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 165km/h (105mph) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land as it passed through central Virginia, and Isabel became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on September 19.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town {{occurred}} at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when {{an explosion of}} firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Oslo Sporveier {{decided to}} {{transfer}} all the remaining trams to Bærumsbanen. Their high speed made them well suited on the light rail, but the centre door reduced their capacity. The order of the SM53-series from Høka gave Oslo Sporveier sufficient stock to operate the street lines, and from 1952 to 1957, the company transferred the 19 trams to Bærumsbanen. Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in too bad condition to be used on the line, and was retired. In October 1949, no. 184 caught fire and was taken out of service. On 2 August 1958, five people perished and 17 were injured in the Strømsveien tram fire, the worst <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tramway's history.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm. In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the series}} of battles around Baykand, the Turgesh retired north to Samarkand, where they {{assaulted}} the fortress of Kamarja, while Ashras with his troops besieged Bukhara and wintered in its oasis. Warfare did not die down, however, and the Arabs' situation remained precarious: when, in early 730, Ashras' newly appointed successor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri tried to reach the army, which was still encamped in the Bukhara oasis, {{he had to be}} escorted from Amul by 7,000 cavalry who were attacked on the way by the Turgesh and almost destroyed. Although Bukhara was recovered by the Arabs at this time, either under Ashras or under Junayd, in the very next year the latter led the Khurasani army to <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Defile, an event which shattered the tenuous Arab control over what remained of their possessions in Transoxiana. The Arabs were not able to recover their position until the governorship of Nasr ibn Sayyar, who in 739–741 managed to re-establish the Caliphate's authority up to Samarkand.|$|E

5|$|Oman's most {{damaging}} storm was Cyclone Gonu in 2007, {{which was the}} strongest recorded storm in the Arabian Sea and the strongest to make landfall on the landmass. Gonu left US$4billion in damage and killed 50people, making it the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. In 2010, a slightly weaker cyclone named Phet caused US$780million in damage and 24deaths while crossing eastern Oman. Cyclonic Storm Keila in the subsequent year killed 19people while looping near Oman's southern coastline, and left US$80million in damage. In 1890, a storm killed 757people when it flooded much of Oman's capital. A storm in 1959 caused a shipwreck near southern Oman, resulting {{in the loss of}} all 141 crewmembers. Another storm-related shipwreck killed 18people in December 1998. In June 1977, a storm struck Masirah Island, causing 105deaths and becoming Oman's worst natural <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Other deadly systems include a storm in 2002 that killed nine and caused US$25million in damage, and Cyclone Nilofar in 2014 which killed four people from its outer rainbands.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
5|$|One of the lahars {{virtually}} {{erased the}} small town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchiná, in the department of Caldas. In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is also the deadliest known lahar, and Colombia's worst natural disaster.|$|E

5|$|Saumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a gig to Venerable at 08:00, {{just as the}} {{foremast}} also fell overboard, {{with instructions}} that if the combined French and Spanish squadron, visible off Cadiz, should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire. Thames was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose, but Hood refused the order and insisted {{that he would be}} able to save his ship. Eventually the arrival of Audacious and Superb on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in Formidable. Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city's population, unaware of the <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gut of Gibraltar. The confusion meant that the situations of the lost ships were unknown, and Saint Antoines arrival was still anticipated at Cadiz as late as 16 July.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado to touch down in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The tornado {{is known as the}} worst <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Chappaqua.|$|E
5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath of the}} cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction wrought by the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of communicable disease outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded {{by a lack of}} pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E

5|$|The Viet Minh {{engaged in}} counter-propaganda campaigns {{in an attempt}} to deter the exodus from the north. They moved through the neighbourhoods of Hanoi and Haiphong on a daily basis, passing out their pamphlets. Evacuees {{reported}} being ridiculed by the Viet Minh, who claimed that they would be sadistically tortured before being killed by the French and American authorities in Haiphong. The communists depicted the personnel of Task Force 90 as cannibals who would eat their babies, predicting <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungles, beaches and mountains of South Vietnam. They further said that the Americans would throw them overboard to drown in the ocean. The Viet Minh boasted to the emigrants that it was a high and futile risk, asserting that the 1956 reunification elections would result in a decisive communist victory. The communist efforts were helped by the fact that many French or State of Vietnam offices in the north evacuated their personnel and sold or otherwise left behind their printing facilities, many of which fell into Viet Minh hands.|$|E
5|$|The storm sent a {{plume of}} {{moisture}} throughout the Arabian Peninsula, contributing to dust storms {{as far north as}} Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding in valleys after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species of weed contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Prinz Adalbert {{served as}} a gunnery {{training}} ship, a role she held {{for the majority of}} her career. She trained with the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), later renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries. After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of Libau in support of the German Army. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired. She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915; the torpedo detonated her ammunition magazines and destroyed the ship. She sank quickly with heavy loss of life; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675. This proved to be the worst German naval <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baltic during the war.|$|E
