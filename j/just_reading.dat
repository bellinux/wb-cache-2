25|$|Multimodality in {{classrooms}} {{has brought about}} the need for a new definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only {{in classrooms}}, but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When I was reading the episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|Digital {{was created}} and {{released}} by Christine Love in February 2010. Although {{it was not}} her first game, it was her first successful one; Love noted in January 2011 that her previous titles were played by [...] "less than a dozen" [...] people, while Digital had been played by [...] "countless thousands", gotten onto the reading lists of university classes, and became [...] "a defining point in [...] writing career". It was also her largest game to date; prior to its release she thought of herself only as a writer, not as a game developer. She made Digital as a visual novel rather than just prose because she felt that immersing the player into the game would allow the story to resonate with them more than <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> the text. Love chose to set {{the game in the}} 1980s rather than more recently because she felt that the computing systems and number of people online then created a sense of isolation, which she felt was more conducive to both the romance and mystery aspects of the story. One of Love's influences on the gameplay was Uplink; she initially intended to reference more of its gameplay mechanics but eventually [...] "streamlined" [...] much of the hacking elements of Digital away.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{elements}} of the series, Zombiepowder.s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was [...] "the entire sum and substance" [...] of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap: [...] "The theme is fighting. Sitting there and <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read," [...] and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a [...] "great shōnen tale", but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.s [...] "wall-to-wall" [...] action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.|$|E

500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese media {{noted in}} November 2008 that Asō often mispronounced or {{incorrectly}} read kanji words written in his speeches, {{even though many}} of the words are commonly used in Japanese. Asō spoke of the speaking errors to reporters on 12 November 2008 saying, [...] "Those were <b>just</b> <b>reading</b> errors, just mistakes." [...] Asō's tendency for malapropisms has led comparisons to George W. Bush, and the use of his name, [...] "Tarō" [...] as a schoolyard taunt for unintelligent children.|$|E
