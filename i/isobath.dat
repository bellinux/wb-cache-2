40|$|At the Alfred Wegener Institute, we {{perceive}} a strong need for thecreation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for morphogeneticinterpretation and numerical models dependent on bottom topography(e. g. current and tide models), {{as well as}} planning future scientific work. A serious problem that we encounter {{is the lack of}} complete bathymetricdata in these regions. Much of the available bathymetry is available inform of <b>isobaths,</b> either in analog (chart) or in digital form (e. g. GEBCO). Thus, we had a need for a methodology of creating DEMs based on theseisobaths. The basic demands that are posed on a DEM created from <b>isobaths</b> are:a) the <b>isobaths</b> themselves must be reproducible from the DEM,b) the morphologic data content in the <b>isobaths</b> must be fully used, and;c) no artefacts should be introduced. The first criterion can easily be tested. The second criterion, however,must be tested with the help of data showing similar morphologicalcharacteristics as the area be modeled. The third criterion is perhaps themost difficult to test, as it must be defined what constitutes an artefactin the context. It has been our experience that most of the existing DEM creationalgorithms do not yield satisfactory results, or require too much humaninteraction, with the data available to us. We, therefore, developed asimple approach that yields good results in the areas of our interest. In this paper we give a description of the methodology, and presentsome of the results obtained using this approach...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{the project}} is {{the design of the}} digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) of the bottoms of Barents Sea, Pechora Sea, and the White Sea. Accuracy (resolution) of DEMs allows for adequate delineation of morphological structures and peculiarities of the sea bottoms and the design of bathymetrical and derivative maps. DEMs of the sea bottom were compiled using data from navigation charts of different scales, where additional <b>isobaths</b> were drawn manually taking into account the classification features of the bottom topography forms. Next procedures were carried out: scanning of these charts, processing of scanned images, <b>isobaths</b> vectorization and creation of attribute tables, vector layers transformation to geographical coordinates as well editing, merging and joining of the map sheets, correction of geometry and attributes. For generation of digital model of bottom topography it is important to choose algorithm which allows for representation all of the sea bottom features expressed by <b>isobaths</b> in most details. The original algorithm based on fast calculation of distances to the two different nearest <b>isobaths</b> was used. Interpretation of isolines as vector linear objects is the main peculiarity of this algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. Wave {{measurements}} at Margarita Reef in south-western Puerto Rico {{show that}} wave height decreases as waves travel across the forereef {{and into the}} backreef. Wave spectra reveal the presence of two wave trains impinging on the reef during the study: trade-wind waves and locally generated seas. Significant wave height calcu-lated from the spectra show an average reduction of 19. 5 % from 20 - to 10 -m <b>isobaths</b> and 26 % from 20 - to 5 -m <b>isobaths.</b> The significant wave height decreases an average of 82 % for waves traveling across the reefcrest and into the backreef. Wave-energy reduction is 35 % from 20 - to 10 -m <b>isobaths</b> and 45 % from 20 - to 5 -m <b>isobaths.</b> Energy loss across the reef crest is 97 % which translates into the formation of strong across-the-reef currents capable of moving coarse sediment. Refraction diagrams of waves impinging on the reef from the SE provide a display of wave energy distribution around the reef. The transmission coefficients calculated for trade-wind waves and locally generated seas have means of 18 % and 39 %, respectively. A wave height model with negligible energy dissipation, produces wave height estimates that are, in general, within the f 15 % error bands. Results of wave-energy changes from this study were applied to waves representative of hurricane conditions at the reef. Aerial photographs of the reef {{before and after the}} passage of hurricanes were compared to assess the reef changes. Changes observed in the photographs are interpreted as products of sediment transport by hurricane-generated waves. The patterns of change agree with the refraction diagrams suggesting that waves were the main agents of change at Margarita Reef during severe storms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Along- and cross-shelf {{correlation}} {{scales of}} subtidal cross-shelf (u) and along-shelf (v) velocities are estimated using moored records from several field programs over the northern California shelf. Over record lengths of 4 - 6 months, along-shelf correlation scales of v {{are greater than}} maximum mooring separations (60 km). In the cross-shelf direction, v is generally correlated between the 60 and 130 rn <b>isobaths</b> (10 - 15 km separation). Along-shelf correlation scales of u are much smaller than those of v and are often not resolved by minimum mooring separations. Time series between November 1988 and May 1989 do resolve along-shelf correlation scales of near-surface u and indicate that they are 15 - 20 km. During this time the along-shelf correlation scale of near-surface u shows variability on a monthly scale. It is generally long (30 km or more) when correlation of u with wind stress is high and short (15 km or less) when correlation with wind stress is low. On at least one occasion, short along-shelf correlation scales coincide with the intrusion of an offshore mesoscale feature onto the shelf. Cross-shelf correlation scales of u are resolved for typical mooring separations. In general, u is correlated between the 90 and 130 rn <b>isobaths</b> (7 - 13 km separation) and between the 60 and 90 rn <b>isobaths</b> (- 5 km). 1...|$|R

40|$|Pygmy {{sperm whales}} (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) strand {{frequently}} in the southeastern United States (SEUS). To detect seasonal trends in Kogia sp. strandings across the SEUS, all 979 stranding events from 1977 through 2005 were segregated by month. A peak in strandings occurred {{in the late summer}} and early fall (July – October). The entire SEUS was divided into segments of similar coastline orientation, 1) North and South Carolina, 2) Georgia and the east coast of Florida, 3) Florida Keys, 4) west coast of Florida, 5) Florida panhandle, Alabama and Mississippi, 6) Louisiana and 6) Texas. Most areas displayed a significant peak in strandings in summer and a smaller significant peak in winter. A seasonal index analysis of the strandings revealed the same pattern as the general seasonal analysis. Analysis of wind direction changes preceding stranding events revealed six patterns. The most common pattern was when winds shifted from downwelling-favorable to upwelling-favorable during the week prior to a stranding. Analysis of sea level confirmed that when wind was upwelling-favorable, sea level decreased and when wind was downwelling-favorable, sea level increased. Seasonal upwelling along central Florida’s Atlantic coast observed in the summer correlates with upwelling-favorable wind patterns during summer months, and increased Kogia sp. strandings. A smaller peak in strandings that occurs in the winter months appears to occur when there is a shift from the ‘normal’ downwelling-favorable conditions into a brief period of upwelling-favorable conditions. Along Florida’s Atlantic coast, distances to <b>isobaths</b> from stranding sites were not significantly different from distances of randomly selected sites to isobaths; however, there is a tendency towards shorter distances to <b>isobaths.</b> Along the Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina coast, distances to <b>isobaths</b> from strandings sites are significantly different from distances of randomly selected sites to <b>isobaths.</b> The distinctive bathymetry of the SEUS Atlantic coast may contribute to strandings across the entire SEUS Atlantic coast. Analysis of the frequency of Kogia sp. strandings during the lunar cycle revealed no significant correlation between strandings and lunar day. Both wind direction and bathymetry may influence frontal structures and water movements, and thus abiotic environmental factors may be significant factors in determining the locations and timing of Kogia sp. stranding events...|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{mean and}} synoptic fluctuation of the wintertime Taiwan Warm Current (TWC) were investigated using a well-validated finite volume community ocean model. The spatial distribution and {{dynamics of the}} synoptic fluctuation were highlighted. The seasonal mean of the wintertime TWC has two branches: an inshore branch between the 30  and 100  m <b>isobaths</b> and an offshore branch between the 100  and 200  m <b>isobaths.</b> The Coriolis term is {{much larger than the}} inertia term and is almost balanced by the pressure gradient term in both branches, indicating geostrophic balance of the mean current. Two areas with significant fluctuations of the TWC were identified during wintertime. One of the areas is located to the north of Taiwan with velocities varying in the cross-shore direction. These significant cross-shore fluctuations are driven by barotropic pressure gradients associated with the intrusion of the Taiwan Strait Current (TSC). When a strong TSC intrudes to the north of Taiwan, the isobaric slope tilts downward from south to north, leading to a cross-shore current from the coastal area to the offshore area. When the TSC intrusion is weak, the cross-shore current to the north of Taiwan is directed from offshore to inshore. The other area of significant fluctuation is located in the inshore area between the 30  and 100  m <b>isobaths.</b> The fluctuations are generally strong both in the alongshore and cross-shore directions, in particular at the latitudes 26. 5  and 28 ° N. Wind affects the synoptic fluctuation through episodic events. When the northeasterly monsoon prevails, the southwestward Zhe-Min coastal current dominates the inshore area associated with a deepening of the mixed layer. When the winter monsoon is weakened or the southwesterly wind prevails, the northeastward TWC dominates in the inshore area...|$|R
