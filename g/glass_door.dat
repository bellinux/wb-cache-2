5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{was born}} in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, which was then part of West Riding of Yorkshire (the County of South Yorkshire was created in 1974). He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>doors</b> {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|R

5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected {{woman in his}} laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E
25|$|Entrances to the {{structure}} were somewhat less varied. Most exterior doors were <b>glass.</b> <b>Door</b> jambs were usually green metal but sometimes made of bronze or steel. Glass and metal canopies protected most doorways.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce their}} {{negative}} thermal {{impact on the}} living space, <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> should have insulated frames and be double or triple glazed, with low-emissivity coatings and gas filling (typically argon). Metal framed <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> should also have thermal breaks. The doors should be properly sized and protected (using shades, blinds, curtains and other means).|$|R
5000|$|Swinging <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> are {{a better}} choice than the typical sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> since they offer a much tighter seal, but glass - even the best type of glass, chosen {{according}} to the climate zone - is always a poor insulator, making doors based on them a poor choice from a thermal comfort perspective.|$|R

25|$|De Wallen, {{also known}} as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a {{designated}} area for legalised prostitution and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known red-light district.

25|$|Following {{the bomb}} explosion, the entire South Oval was marked as off-limits with crime scene tape. Fans exited the stadium at the {{conclusion}} of the game without incident. The South Oval was open the next afternoon except for the immediate area of the explosion, so a broken <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> could be replaced and firefighters could finish spraying down the area with water to wash debris, chemicals and bodily fluids away from the sidewalk and a bus parked there before the preceding day's game. Classes resumed as normal on Monday.|$|E
25|$|A pet door (also {{known as}} a cat flap or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.|$|E

Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E

25|$|Over {{six hundred}} Old Newingtonians enlisted during World War I {{and the loss}} of life was appalling. By war's end, 109 Old Boys had died for God, King and Country. Prior to 1920 the walls of the {{vestibule}} {{at the entrance to the}} Founders Wing had been hung with sporting teams photographs. In 1921 this space was transformed by the installation of white marble tablets, encased in Queensland maple, upon which were inscribed the names of Old Boys who had served. Those who had made the supreme sacrifice are listed on the central panels below the words: These Nobly Strining, Nobly Fell. With a black and white marble floor and stained <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> panels this space takes on the feel of a small chapel.|$|E

He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
