40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: <b>Intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> are inte-gral to the {{practice}} of modern medicine. Potential risk factors for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) include underlying disease, method of catheter insertion, and dura-tion and purpose of catheterization. The administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) through <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> increases CRBSI risks. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the risk factors of CRBSI in patients with PN administration. Methods: This study was conducted at the Karadeniz Technical University Hospital between October 2003 and November 2004. All the patients to whom PN was administered through <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> were prospec-tively monitored for the presence of CRBSI and risk factors. Results: During the study period, 111 <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> through which PN was administered were monitored for a total of 1646 catheter-days. CRBSI was determined in 31 cases, a CRBSI rate of 18. 8 per 1000 catheter-days. When risk factors affecting CRBSI were investigated using logistic regression, an increase in APACHE II score (OR, 1. 10; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 21; p. 012), prolongation of catheterization (OR, 1. 08; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 1. 14; p. 004), catheterization in emergent conditions (OR, 5. 45; 95 % CI, 1. 20 – 24. 82;...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{signs are}} not {{sufficiently}} reliable for establishing diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infection. Therefore, microbiological confirmation, {{based on the}} culture of the catheter tip after its removal, is necessary in diagnosing the infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency and the degree of microbial colonization of <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> (IVK), and the risk for the onset of sepsis, by using qualitative, semiquantitative (roll plate) and quantitative (vortexing) catheter culture techniques. During the period April 2001 December 2002, 289 <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> were cultured. A total of 284 microorganisms were isolated from 217 (75 %) culture-positive catheters. The frequency of isolation of some organisms was the following coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 41 %, Staphylococcus aureus 19 % Enterococci spp 6 %, other Gram-positive microorganisms 9 %, Gram-negative microorganisms 21 %, and fungi 4 %. In 35 catheters, cultures were polymicrobial; two microorganisms were found in 25 cultures and three were found to be in 10 cultures. There were 122 (46 %) <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> which were found significantly colonized. A high rate of positivity and a high rate of S. aureus isolates and Gram-negative bacteria indicate the need of establishing the exact microbiological diagnosis of these infections, and the rigorous undertaking of adequate control and preventive measures...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} a rapid enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for {{the diagnosis of}} <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter</b> related sepsis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci. Methods: Forty patients with a clinical and microbiological diagnosis of <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter</b> related sepsis and positive blood cultures, caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, and 40 control patients requiring a central venous catheter {{as part of their}} clinical management were recruited into the study. Serum IgG responses to a previously undetected exocellular antigen produced by coagulase negative staphylococci, termed lipid S, were determined in the patient groups by a rapid ELISA. Results: There was a significant difference (p = < 0. 0001) in serum IgG to lipid S between patients with catheter related sepsis and controls. The mean antibody titre in patients with sepsis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci was 10 429 (range, no detectable serum IgG antibody to 99 939), whereas serum IgG was not detected in the control group of patients. Conclusions: The rapid ELISA offers a simple, economical, and rapid diagnostic test for suspected <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter</b> related sepsis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, which can be difficult to diagnose clinically.

40|$|Background: The use of {{indwelling}} devices like Urinary catheter, Drain tubes, Central <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter,</b> endotracheal tubes {{has become}} routine {{practice in the}} medical field. Localized or systematic infection are frequent complications associated with extensive use of these devices, requiring its removal or may even be associated with life threatening consequences. Materials and Methods: Microbiological study was carried out among all the indwelling device samples received from 20 th April 2011 to 19 th April 2012 at Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital. Results: Out of total 205 samples (125 Foley’s catheters, 31 drain tubes, 29 central <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter</b> lines and 20 endotracheal tubes) received during this study period, 38. 4 % urinary catheters, 23. 33 % drain tubes, 6. 9 % central <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter</b> lines and 40. 0 % endotracheal tubes {{were found to have}} significant growth. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were found to be the commonest organisms. Conclusion: The infection rates of indwelling devices used for various reasons are found to be very high. These infections have increased the morbidity and mortality of the hospitalized patients and also increased the duration of hospital stay. Thus aseptic measurements during insertion of these devices periodic change of these devices may help to overcome these complications.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} of risk factors to the occurrence of urinary tract infection in full-term newborn infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study (1997) including full-term infants having a positive urine culture by bag specimen. Urine collection was based on: fever, weight loss > 10 % of birth weight, nonspecific symptoms (feeding intolerance, failure to thrive, hypoactivity, debilitate suction, irritability), or renal and urinary tract malformations. In these cases, another urine culture by suprapubic bladder aspiration was collected to confirm the diagnosis. To compare and validate the risk factors in each group, the selected cases {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I - positive urine culture by bag specimen collection and negative urine culture by suprapubic aspiration, and Group II - positive urine culture by bag specimen collection and positive urine culture by suprapubic aspiration. RESULTS: Sixty one infants were studied, Group I, n = 42 (68. 9 %) and Group II, n = 19 (31. 1 %). The selected risk factors (associated infectious diseases, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal and urinary tract malformations, mechanical ventilation, parenteral nutrition and <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter)</b> were more frequent in Group II (p< 0. 05). Through relative risk analysis, risk factors were, in decreasing importance: parenteral nutrition, <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter,</b> associated infectious diseases, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and renal and urinary tract malformations. CONCLUSION: The results showed that parenteral nutrition, <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheter,</b> and associated infectious diseases contributed to increase the frequency of neonatal urinary tract infection, and in the presence of more than one risk factor, the occurrence of urinary tract infection rose up to 11 times...|$|E

40|$|<b>Intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} inserted medical devices and they are known to cause a large number of catheter related bloodstream infections (BSIs). Biofilms are associated with many chronic infections due to the aggregation of microorganisms. One of these organisms is the fungus Candida albicans. It has shown {{to be one of the}} leading causes of catheter-related BSIs. The presence of biofilm on <b>intravascular</b> <b>catheters</b> provide increased tolerance against antimicrobial treatments, thus alternative treatment strategies are sought. Traditionally, many strategies, such as application of combined antimicrobials, addition of antifungals, and removal of catheters, have been practiced, but they were not successful in eradicating BSIs. Since these fungal infections can result in significant morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare cost, other promising preventive strategies, including antimicrobial lock therapy, chelating agents, alcohol, and biofilm disruptors, have been applied. In this review, current success and failure of these new approaches, and a comparison with the previous strategies are discussed in order to understand which preventative treatment is the most effective in controlling the catheter-related BSIs...|$|R
