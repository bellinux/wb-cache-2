5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. <b>In</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> had been worth fighting. Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and those who thought that the pageantry was designed to distract from the poor living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|Objectivism's central tenets {{are that}} reality exists {{independently}} of consciousness, {{that human beings}} have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception {{through the process of}} concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.|$|E

25|$|Herbert died in 1986, {{leaving his}} vision of the actual events of the Butlerian Jihad {{unexplored}} and open to speculation. The Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson presents the Jihad as a war between humans and the sentient machines they had created, who rise up and nearly destroy humanity. The series explains that humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the Titans use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe. Their reign lasts for a century; eventually they give too much access and power to the AI program Omnius, which usurps control from the Titans themselves. Seeing no value <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> the thinking machines—now including armies of robot soldiers and other aggressive machines—dominate and enslave nearly all of humanity in the universe for 900 years, until a jihad is ignited. This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century, with much loss of human life but ultimately ending in human victory.|$|E
25|$|Evidence-based studies {{indicate}} that {{the life span of}} an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices. For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men—as of 2013 the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated at 70.2 years compared to 66.1 for a boy. There are significant geographical variations <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development—for example life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 84.8years for girls and 78.9 for boys, while in Swaziland, primarily because of AIDS, it is 31.3years for both sexes. The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40years. In the developing world the median age is between 15 and 20years. While one in five Europeans is 60years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60years of age or older. The number of centenarians (humans of age 100years or older) in the world was estimated by the United Nations at 210,000 in 2002. At least one person, Jeanne Calment, is known to have reached the age of 122years; higher ages have been claimed but they are not well substantiated.|$|E

500|$|The largest {{effect on}} the {{continental}} tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the theoretical attitude in general which of course includes the scientific attitude. [...] For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical {{of the importance of}} science <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, {{there have been a number}} of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, Alexandre Koyré. [...] Another important development was that of Michel Foucault's analysis of the historical and scientific thought in The Order of Things and his study of power and corruption within the [...] "science" [...] of madness. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include Jürgen Habermas (e.g., [...] "Truth and Justification", 1998), Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and Wolfgang Stegmüller ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).|$|E
500|$|According to Martin, {{the fantasy}} genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality, instead often {{treating}} sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely. Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> {{that should not}} be excluded from the narrative. Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin, who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, [...] "whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex." [...] Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime. The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.|$|E
500|$|Nature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept {{inspired}} by the Stoic philosophy which underlies much of his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: [...] "nature, that is life" [...] is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, [...] "for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things". This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and {{is crucial to the}} understanding of the Natural History. The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, painting and jewellery. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern ecological theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.|$|E
