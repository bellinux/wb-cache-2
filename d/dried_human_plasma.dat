Two animals were rechallenged with inoculum treated in the same manner, except that saline was used instead of a disinfectant chemical; both were infected within 4 weeks. Our results showed that hepatitis B virus was not as resistant to disinfectant chemicals as once thought and suggested that chemicals with similar activity levels (intermediate to high) might possibly be used on hepatitis B virus contamination with a margin of safety...|$|E
40|$|THE {{ability of}} the enzyme l-asparaginase to inhibit the growth of certain rodent tumours has been {{extensively}} studied and the subject has been recently reviewed (Old, Boyse and Campbell, 1968; Broome, 1968 a). Preliminary clinical trials (Dolowy et al., 1967; Hill et al., 1968; Oettgen et al., 1968) indicate {{that it may be}} of value in some cases of human leukaemia, but its further evaluation is limited by the difficulty of extraction and preparation in a form suitable for therapeutic use. The activity of l-asparaginase derived from E. coli {{has been shown to be}} enhanced in vitro by the addition of human and animal sera (Lee and Bridges, 1968). In this paper we report on the effect of the addition of human serum and its fractions on the tumour inhibiting property of l-asparaginase in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS The assay of asparaginase was as previously described (Lee and Bridges, 1968) being based on that of Meister (1955). One unit of activity is that quantity of enzyme which releases 1,amole of ammonia from l-asparagine per hour at the maximum rate. The leukaemia used in this study, EARADI (Old, Boyse and Stockert, 1965), was induced by X-radiation in (C 57 BL/ 6 XA) F 1 female mice and carried by us during the time of these experiments in transplant generations No. 137 - 156. Parent mice and hybrids were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Spinner Modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories) made 10 % with horse serum was used for the suspension of cells during transplantation. Pooled guinea pig serum from Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs was obtained by cardiac puncture and stored, without preservative, at- 20 ° C. (Stayne Laboratories). The asparaginase activity was in the range 106 - 157 units per ml. The E. coli asparaginase used throughout the experiments was from a single batch of specific activity, 100 i. u. /mg. of protein, obtained as a gift from the Wadley Research Institute, Dallas.

40|$|Background: Plasminogen {{is one of}} the {{compounds}} derived from <b>human</b> <b>plasma.</b> Activation of plasminogen produces plasmin. Plasmin is able to lyse fibrinogen, fibrin, and some other <b>human</b> <b>plasma</b> proteins. The aim of the present work was to study the separation of human plasminogen by affinity chromatography using gel lysine Sepharose. Materials and Methods: Normal <b>human</b> <b>plasma</b> was used as the starting material. By increasing its concentration of ethanol from 0 % to 8 % in pH 7. 2 at- 3 o C the centrifugation was carried out and the supernatant I was separated from precipitate I. Then supernatant fraction I was used for separation of <b>human</b> plasminogen from <b>plasma</b> and further purification was carried out using affinity chromatography using affinity gel lysine Sepharose. Results: In our study we could obtain plasminogen with the concentration of 0. 5 %. In normal <b>human</b> <b>plasma</b> the concentration of plasminogen is about 200 mg/l. Comparing the result with the concentration of plasminogen in normal <b>human</b> <b>plasma</b> shows about 25 folds higher concentration.
