25|$|On 10 May 2013, the B.C. provincial {{government}} {{announced that the}} Hawaii Mars {{would no longer be}} placed on contract after the 2013 season, due to not having been used to fight any B.C. fires for two years and the operation of newer and more versatile aircraft by the Coulson group including a Lockheed C-130 Hercules converted to firefighting use.

25|$|Age falsification is the {{practice}} of advancing gymnasts' ages to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts. Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification. In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press. Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led {{to the discovery of}} age falsification.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{witnesses}} to the murder, of whom more than 25 <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> to the police. The killer was described by witnesses as a man between 30 and 50 years of age, about 180 to 185 centimetres tall, and wearing a dark jacket or coat. Many described him as having walked with a limp or otherwise clumsily. No witness {{was in a position}} to observe the killer's appearance in any detail. A police sketch of the supposed killer was widely circulated in the media a week after the murder, leading to a massive influx of tips from the public, but it was later determined that the witness on whose statement it was based probably had not seen the actual assailant. No good description of the killer's appearance therefore exists. Witnesses agreed on the killer's escape route.|$|E
25|$|The police {{eventually}} {{identify the}} victim's clothing as being of French manufacture. Emma tells {{the police that}} she had received a letter claiming to be from Martine, a French girl whom her brother Edmund had wanted to marry. He had written about Martine and their impending marriage days {{before his death in}} the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. The letter purporting to be from Martine claims that she was pregnant when Edmund died and that she now wishes their son to have all of the advantages to which his parentage should entitle him. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine but this proves not to be the case when Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James Stoddart-West, reveals that she is Martine. Although she and Edmund had intended to marry, Edmund died before they could do so and she later married an SOE officer and settled in England. She adds that she would not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> until learning from her son of the forged letter to Emma.|$|E

500|$|Some artists, {{including}} Slash, Kings of Leon and Foo Fighters, {{have declined}} to have their songs used on the show. Murphy has been publicly critical of these refusals, {{which has led to}} exchanges in the press between him and a number of artists. A slated cover of Sir Mix-a-Lot's [...] "Baby Got Back" [...] in the season four episode [...] "Sadie Hawkins" [...] has been criticized for blatantly copying a rendition of the song by Jonathan Coulton without his permission, without giving creative credit. Side-by-Side comparison shows the waveforms appear remarkably similar. Other artists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> with allegations of plagiarism in light of this development. It was reported that musician Prince had not given permission for Glee to cover his hit [...] "Kiss" [...] before filming the performance of the cover.|$|E
500|$|During the Harper government, {{it was not}} {{possible}} for government employed scientists to openly speak about the government policy that prohibited communication with the media.

[...] Kristi Miller-Saunders was a scientist employed by the government at the time as is currently employed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. [...] She has stated that she was repeatedly prevented by the Harper government from speaking with the public and the press about her research. [...] A high-profile example is the paper that she and her colleagues published on their investigation into why sockeye salmon were dying in unusual numbers in the Fraser River on their way to spawn. [...] The government denied her permission to speak with any reporter. [...] Miller-Saunders is one example of many.|$|E
