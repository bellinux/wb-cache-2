5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has <b>implied</b> a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also <b>implied</b> that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|In 1925 the Requiem was {{published}} in Vienna as a pocket score, Philharmonia-Taschenpartitur No.284. Edition Peters published it in 1928, stating the performance duration as 25minutes, although the duration <b>implied</b> by the metronome marking is 14minutes.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, inferring that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is <b>implied</b> by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As <b>implied</b> in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E
5000|$|... or {{in other}} words, one-one reducibility <b>implies</b> many-one reducibility, which <b>implies</b> truth-table reducibility, which in turn <b>implies</b> weak truth-table reducibility, which in turn <b>implies</b> Turing reducibility.|$|R

5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction {{from what was}} seen to what was <b>implied</b> in the spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the <b>implied</b> image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{statements}} also <b>implied</b> {{his survival}} of the stunt, as the special had already been filmed.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the flow is that shear stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant. (This is <b>implied</b> by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E
5000|$|... if p, q and r {{are three}} {{arbitrary}} propositions, then either p <b>implies</b> q or q <b>implies</b> r. This is because if q is true then p <b>implies</b> it, {{and if it}} is false then q <b>implies</b> any other statement. Since r can be p, it follows that given two arbitrary propositions, one must <b>imply</b> the other, even if they are mutually contradictory. For instance, [...] "Nadia is in Barcelona <b>implies</b> Nadia is in Madrid, or Nadia is in Madrid <b>implies</b> Nadia is in Barcelona." [...] This truism sounds like nonsense in ordinary discourse.|$|R
50|$|We {{already said}} that NC <b>implies</b> GS which <b>implies</b> SI, and that SI <b>implies</b> MX. This closes the loop and shows that all these {{properties}} are equivalent (there is also a direct proof that SNC <b>implies</b> MX).|$|R
5000|$|A {{cardinal}} {{utility function}} <b>implies</b> a preference relation: [...] <b>implies</b> [...] and [...] <b>implies</b> [...] Utility functions can have several properties.|$|R
5|$|After negotiations, and <b>implied</b> {{threats to}} Noel Maguire, they {{agreed not to}} split the {{nationalist}} vote by contesting the election and Sands stood as an Anti H-Block candidate against Ulster Unionist Party candidate Harry West. Following a high-profile campaign the election took place on 9 April, and Sands {{was elected to the}} British House of Commons with 30,492 votes to West's 29,046.|$|E
5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy <b>implied</b> a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.|$|E
5|$|As Eddington {{pointed out}} in 1924, densities of this order <b>implied</b> that, {{according}} {{to the theory of}} general relativity, the light from Sirius B should be gravitationally redshifted. This was confirmed when Adams measured this redshift in 1925.|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of propositions <b>imply</b> SCH. As was noted above, GCH <b>implies</b> SCH. On the other hand, the proper forcing axiom which <b>implies</b> [...] and hence is {{incompatible}} with GCH also <b>implies</b> SCH. Solovay showed that large cardinals almost <b>imply</b> SCH—in particular, if [...] is strongly compact cardinal, then the SCH holds above [...] On the other hand, the non-existence of (inner models for) various large cardinals (below a measurable of Mitchell order [...] ) also <b>imply</b> SCH.|$|R
50|$|If the {{valuation}} {{function is}} monotone, then GS <b>implies</b> SI and SI <b>implies</b> NC and NC <b>implies</b> GS, so these three conditions are equivalent.|$|R
5|$|Because Lichfield {{had been}} {{established}} by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the <b>implied</b> criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield. Coenwulf's embassy bore {{a letter to the}} pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter <b>implied</b> that Coenwulf was asking for Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It <b>implied</b> that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship <b>implied</b> by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Deceased. A gun-toting vigilante, {{motivated}} by the deaths of her parents and sister {{at the hands of}} the Nazis in their native Austria. Zandt is killed along with her lesbian lover in what is <b>implied</b> to be a hate-crime.|$|E
5000|$|L-{{reductions}} also <b>imply</b> P-reduction. [...] One may deduce that L-reductions <b>imply</b> PTAS reductions {{from this}} fact {{and the fact}} that P-reductions <b>imply</b> PTAS reductions.|$|R
50|$|Validity <b>implies</b> reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability {{does not}} {{necessarily}} <b>imply</b> validity, however: A reliable measure does not <b>imply</b> that it is valid.|$|R

5|$|He {{had also}} {{proposed}} to twin constituencies and have Members of Parliament (MPs) contest as a pair, {{one of whom}} had to be from a minority community. However, Malay MPs were upset that this <b>implied</b> they were not electable on their own merits. Feeling that the twinning of constituencies would lead to Malay MPs losing confidence and self-respect, the Government dropped the proposal.|$|E
5|$|He {{repeatedly}} took credit {{during this}} period for operations {{in which he had}} no involvement, including the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing, 1985 Bradford City stadium fire, and 1986 assassination of Zafer al-Masri, the mayor of Nablus (killed by the PFLP, according to Seale). He also <b>implied</b> that he had been behind the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster by publishing a congratulatory note in the ANO magazine, writes Seale.|$|E
5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{version of}} the story, a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is <b>implied</b> to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} main inclusion theorem relates these properties. Super Dedekind completeness <b>implies</b> Dedekind completeness; Dedekind completeness <b>implies</b> both Dedekind -completeness and {{the projection}} property; Both Dedekind σ-completeness and the projection property separately <b>imply</b> the principal projection property; {{and the principal}} projection property <b>implies</b> the Archimedean property.|$|R

5|$|In the 16th century Tycho Brahe {{demonstrated}} that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere {{by measuring the}} parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this <b>implied</b> the comet {{must be at least}} four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In the 1934 novel I, Claudius by English writer Robert Graves, Caligula is {{presented}} as being a murderous sociopath from his childhood, who became clinically insane early in his reign. At the age of only seven, he drove his father Germanicus to despair and death by secretly terrorising him. Graves's Caligula commits incest with all three of his sisters and is <b>implied</b> to have murdered Drusilla.|$|E
5|$|Kylsart appealed his {{conviction}} on count 3 and was bailed pending the appeal. The appeal was heard in November 1931 where the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling {{that although the}} statements within the prospectus were all true, the document {{as a whole was}} false because of what it concealed, omitted or <b>implied.</b>|$|E
