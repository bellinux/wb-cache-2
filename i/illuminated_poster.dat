50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the foyer is from walkway level near {{the north end of}} the terrace of the Royal Festival Hall. To see the intended effect this should be viewed head-on from the north corner of the Royal Festival Hall. One needs to envision the pure effect without the clutter of <b>illuminated</b> <b>poster</b> boxes,the purple name board over the entrance, stained roof and wall panels, paint on the external staircase and light fittings on the external wall. The entrance, in Brutalist style, is in the form of a horizontal slit in a concrete structure, with six pairs of cast aluminium doors.|$|E
40|$|In 1925 {{the soviet}} poet Vladimir Mayakovsky visited New York, and {{commented on the}} city as follows: "Lights go on all along the entire 25 mile long Broadway [...] This is, the Americans say, the Great White Way. It really is white and one has the {{impression}} that it is brighter there at night than in the daytime [...] The street-lamps, the dazzling lights of advertisements, the glow of shop windows and windows of the never- closing stores, the lights <b>illuminating</b> huge <b>posters,</b> lights from the open doors of cinemas and theatres, the speeding lights of automobiles and trolley cars, {{the lights of the}} subway trains glittering under one's feet through the glass pavements, the lights of inscriptions in the sky. The brightness, brightness, brightness [...] . " Mayakovsky's paean to Manhatten and, in particular, to the electric cityscape is an exemplary instance of what David Nye has termed the American technological sublime. Nye's concern is primarily with the period between the late nineteenth century and the 1960 's. Distinctive to this period {{is the way in which}} the experience of the sublime underwent a transference, from nature - obvious examples being, perhaps, Thoreau's Walden or Melville's Moby Dick - to the sociotechnical sphere. Hence, sublime astonishment was not merely found in natural phenomena such as the Grand Canyon or the Niagra Falls, but also in human constructions such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Hoover Dam, or the Apollo Space Mission...|$|R
5000|$|Prostitution in Hong Kong is legal, but {{subject to}} various restrictions, mainly {{intended}} to keep {{it away from the}} public eye. These restrictions are manifested in the form of prohibiting a whole host of activities surrounding prostitution, including soliciting and advertising for sex, working as pimps, running brothels and organised prostitution. For instance, by the Hong Kong legal code Chapter 200 Section 147, any person who [...] "solicits for any immoral purpose" [...] in a public place may receive a maximum penalty of HK$10,000 ($1,280) and six months' imprisonment. In practice, a woman on the street in certain areas well known for streetwalkers such as Sham Shui Po might well be arrested even if seen smiling at a male passer-by. Advertisement of sex services, including signboards, <b>illuminated</b> signs and <b>posters,</b> is also prohibited, and an offence may result in imprisonment for 12 months. In a test case in 2005 involving sex141.com - an internet site created by two programmers who tailored on-line advertisements for prostitutes - its two principals were convicted of one count each of [...] "conspiring to live off the earnings of prostitution arising from the ads that appeared on their website". They were each fined $100,000 ($12,800) and given a suspended sentence of eight months in prison. Time Out records it as the 36th most popular website in Hong Kong. As of November 2011, the site is active and ranks 47th most frequented site in Hong Kong. The site was shut down by the authorities in early December 2013 because the syndicate that controls it is allegedly engaged in activities that are otherwise illegal.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 18 - 19) Through {{a series}} of computer-generated, large-format montages, "The Language of War" poster series presents a critique of wartime atrocities whose rationale and justification rest in specific verses and phrases found in the Scriptures. While a remarkable number of such verses and phrases are self-explanatory {{in terms of their}} literal sanction and even promotion of mass violence, "The Language of War" also takes aim at their underlying, unintended ironies, especially when the passages are considered outside their formal contexts. The intention of these posters are to show the power of art - in terms of both shedding light on contemporary notions of war, particularly those driven by religion and/or ideology, and its role as a tool for war propaganda in a century steeped in mass violence. With cues from the primal visual landscape of medieval Armenian <b>illuminated</b> manuscripts, the <b>posters</b> comprise strategic juxtapositions of art-historical references with imagery from modern journalism. Thus centuries-old images of saints, angels, and ornaments (carrying their proprietary, visceral cultural messages) are fused with photographic excerpts from newspapers and magazines depicting weaponry, war-weary soldiers, grieving mothers, and other subjects. The resulting montages structure language and imagery into provocative narratives, which exploit the power of abiding cliches, thematic typography, and close pairings of image and text. As an exercise in semiotics, "The Language of War" explores the visual vocabulary of communication and ultimately deconstructs it through the manipulation of text and imagery. The conceptual approach and technique parallel those of German photomontage aitist John Heartfield (Figure A- 1) and Israeli graphic designer David Tartakover (Figure A- 2), who appropriated images and techniques used in mass media and popular culture for ironic effect, regenerating them as metaphors for death and violence. Similarly, the use of Scriptural verses and phrases juxtaposed with black and white photographs of conflict, employs a strategy of irony to achieve a string of visual metaphors for the violence and futility of war...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{examines}} {{the use and}} misuse of science information in the federal government. Scientific information is a vital component of policy making in the U. S. today. Stine notes that science research is ???intricately linked to societal needs and the nation???s economy {{in areas such as}} transportation, communication, agriculture, education, environment, health, defense, and jobs??? [7, p. i]. In the past, the relationship between science and policy was seen as a linear process: science conducted research, collected data, and presented its findings to federal agencies, which then use that evidence to determine the best policy action [2, 5]. However, the reality of science policy is far more complex; while science is a valuable source of information, it is also problematic, since scientific data may conflict with political, moral, and economic values [5, 6, 7]. For example, if endangered fish reside in a lake, politicians may face choices between preserving the ecosystem, irrigating nearby farms, and allowing recreational use of the lake. Each choice has economic, environmental, and political ramifications. Doremus explains that ???esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, or scientific??? values can all be considered relevant foundations for agency decisions [3, p. 1136]. Because of this complexity, ???the political community and the scientific community??? collaborate at the boundary of politics and science over the integrity and productivity of research??? [5, p. 143]. In this conceptualization, ???government cannot make good policy decisions unless the decision makers have access to, and appropriately use, the best available understanding of the facts??? [4, p. 1639]. Federal agencies, like individuals, have information behaviors???they create, access, review, share, evaluate, and act upon information in order to formulate and assess public policy. Agencies could accept scientific conclusions and use them as the basis of policy formation. Agencies could accept the science, yet determine {{that it is not the}} best or sole basis of effective policy. Of course, agencies could reject or partially reject the science, thus creating more opportunities to basis policy on other considerations. Typical agency behavior with respect to science falls across a spectrum, with science being neither unreservedly endorsed nor discarded. While ???a scientist views science as a way of learning, a policy maker???may see science as the justification for a decision, a requirement of the law, a tool or impediment, or something that opposes or supports their viewpoint??? [1, p. 1005]. Furthermore, agency information behavior with respect to science does not exist in isolation. There is recurring interaction between science and policy. For instance, scientists who study the toxic effects of chemicals and report their conclusions to the Environmental Protection Agency, to guide agency behavior, will likely continue studying the same chemicals and providing additional information to further influence policy. How the EPA behaves with respect to the scientific information may shape future research, communication efforts, or the information behaviors of the scientists themselves. Principal-agent theory is frequently used to explain how science and policy interact. Under this approach, federal agencies, as principals, contract with science to provide needed information. Science then acts as an agent, supplying data and conclusions in exchange for funding, prestige, and other rewards [5, 6]. Principal-agent theory captures a significant portion of the interaction between science and policy, but does not reflect the entire relationship. Specifically, principal-agent theory has little to say about how agencies use science???the information behaviors in which they engage???or how these information behaviors affect subsequent interaction with scientists. The theory currently does not address the problem of under-utilized or under-appreciated agents. If the agents perceive their work is not incorporated into policy, perhaps they will refuse to do further work, will begin doing shoddy work, or will attempt to subtly integrate policy advice into their work. Since these information behaviors are, in fact, a crucial part of formulating policy, they ought not be overlooked. The nature of the recurring interactions, and how they are affected by agencies??? information behavior, has not been explicitly examined in the previous literature. This <b>poster</b> <b>illuminates</b> these aspects of the relationships between science and policy. Specific examples of agencies using and misusing scientific information will be drawn from the literature to illustrate the complex interactions. The full, cyclical relationship between science and policy will be portrayed, demonstrating how agencies??? information behaviors may affect subsequent research and communication behaviors. This will necessarily entail a refinement of principal-agent theory as it has been applied to science policy. This research will be a valuable contribution in several ways. It brings science policy???how scientific information is used or misused???to the explicit attention of iSchools and their cognate fields of study. As we create technological tools and engage in policy-relevant research, we need to pay attention to how our data and conclusions may or may not be utilized. In addition, science policy can benefit from the theoretical and conceptual rigor of the trans-disciplinary research of the iSchools. Finally, the research will also test and strengthen the use of principal-agent theory as it applies to science policy. Overall, this theory has great utility, but can be refined to address more of the interaction between science and policy...|$|R
