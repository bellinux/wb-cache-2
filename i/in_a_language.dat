5|$|From the start, all {{subjects}} of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language. In 1974, bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students to take {{one or more of}} their humanities or science subjects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> other than their first. The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.|$|E
5|$|When several {{languages}} {{are used in}} a film, the predominant one is always listed first; {{the names of the}} other {{languages are}} written in smaller typesize and placed between brackets.

50|$|Specifically, {{the term}} command {{is used in}} {{imperative}} computer languages. These languages are called this, because statements in these languages are usually written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner similar to the imperative mood used in many natural languages. If one views <b>a</b> statement <b>in</b> <b>an</b> imperative <b>language</b> as being like <b>a</b> sentence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>language,</b> then <b>a</b> command is generally like <b>a</b> verb <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> <b>language.</b>|$|R
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{devoted his}} support {{to a variety}} of causes, {{including}} a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal old-age pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia {{for at least five years}} be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the film's {{success and}} wide-reaching popularity, Saran remade it in Telugu as Gemeni. It {{is the only}} film Saran made <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> other than Tamil. The remake starred Venkatesh and Namitha in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. Posani Krishna Murali {{translated}} the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by R. P. Patnaik, who reused most of the tunes from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed to repeat {{the success of the}} original. In 2013, a Kannada remake was reported to have been planned with Upendra in the lead, but he dismissed the reports as rumours.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 {{the myth}} of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid. The work was praised for not {{directly}} translating, but instead retelling the story <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> which was as fresh and new for the audience today as Ovid's texts were to his contemporary audience. Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Rome Wilfrid {{stopped in}} Frisia to visit Willibrord. Following Wilfrid's arrival in Rome the pope held a council, which {{declared}} that the King of Northumbria should follow the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see. Wilfrid was disconcerted {{to find that the}} papal court spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> Wilfrid could not understand. The pope also ordered another council to be held in Britain to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at Meaux, but he had returned to Kent by 705.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{considered}} {{making a}} {{film on the}} Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea. He said that, as a filmmaker, he {{was more interested in}} the travails of the refugees and not the politics. In 1977, Ray completed Shatranj Ke Khiladi (The Chess Players), a Hindi film based on a story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow in the state of Oudh, a year before the Indian rebellion of 1857. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, this was Ray's first feature film <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> other than Bengali. It is his most expensive and star-studded film, featuring Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough.|$|E

25|$|The clearest {{and most}} {{important}} example of Prague school structuralism lies in phonemics. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> could be analysed {{in terms of a}} series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct phonemes because there are cases (minimal pairs) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of contrastive features also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty Japanese speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in English is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. Phonology would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism {{in a number of different}} fields.|$|E
25|$|The pidgin stage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> is a stage when {{communication}} occurs {{through a}} grammatically simplified means, developing between {{two or more}} groups {{that do not have}} a language in common.

25|$|Unchecked {{exception}} types should {{generally not}} be handled, except possibly at the outermost levels of scope.

25|$|The Council of Europe {{adopted the}} European Convention on Human Rights in 1950, which makes some {{reference}} to linguistic rights. In Article 5.2, reasons for arrest and charges {{have to be}} communicated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> understood by the person. Secondly, Article 6.3 grants an interpreter for free in a court, if the language used cannot be spoken or understood.|$|E
25|$|Similar to this concept, eigenvoices {{represent}} {{the general direction}} of variability in human pronunciations of a particular utterance, such as a word <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language.</b> Based on a linear combination of such eigenvoices, a new voice pronunciation of the word can be constructed. These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of this Slavic colony was first mentioned in the 1850s, and was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when linguist Medo Pucić from Dubrovnik did one of his journeys to Italy and overheard a tailor in Naples speaking with his wife <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> very similar to Pucić's own. The tailor then {{told him that he}} came from the village of Živavoda Kruč, then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E

5000|$|According to a {{study on}} lexical access, monolinguals often {{maintain}} <b>a</b> wider vocabulary <b>in</b> <b>a</b> target <b>language</b> relative to <b>a</b> comparable bilingual, and that increases the efficiency of word retrieval in monolinguals.
