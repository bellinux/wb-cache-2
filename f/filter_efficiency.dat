5000|$|Protein {{adsorption}} {{and protein}} fouling can cause major {{problems in the}} food industry (particularly the dairy industry) when proteins from food adsorb to processing surfaces, such as stainless steel or plastic (e.g. polypropylene).

[...] In protein-fouled heating equipment, adsorbed proteins can create an insulating layer between the heater and the bulk material, reducing heating efficiency.

50|$|Two {{processes}} {{influencing the}} functionality of a filter are ripening and regeneration.At {{the beginning of}} a new filter run, the <b>filter</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases simultaneously with the number of captured particles in the medium. This process is called filter ripening. During filter ripening the effluent might not meet quality criteria and must be reinjected at previous steps in the plant. Regeneration methods allow the reuse of the filter medium. Accumulated solids from the filter bed are removed. During backwashing, water (and air) is pumped backwards through the filter system. Backwash water may partially be reinjected in front of the filter process and generated sewage needs to be discarded. The backwashing time is determined by either the turbidity value behind the filter, which must not exceed a set threshold, or by the head loss across the filter medium, which must also not exceed a certain value.|$|E

The images were corrupted by AWGN and spatially correlated noise with a wide set of variance values.

For rather simple images corrupted by AWGN with rather large variance, <b>filtering</b> <b>efficiency</b> is the highest according to the standard metric PSNR and the metric PSNR-HVS-M suited for characterizing visual quality. In cases of spatially correlated noise, high complexity of images and small values of noise variance, sufficient improvement of image quality due to filtering is problematic. It is shown that if AWGN variance is less than 20, noise is practically not seen. To be invisible in original images, spatially correlated noise should have about 3... 4 times smaller variance. Residual noise and distortions because of filtering can become invisible after denoising if noise variance in original image is small enough and efficient filtering, e.g., vector or 3 D filtering, is applied.

Exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) is {{a major issue in}} many industrial workplaces given the potential for serious health impacts to exposed workers; including the potential for lung cancer and adverse irritant and cardiovascular effects. Personal respiratory protective devices are an accepted safety measure to mitigate worker exposure against the potentially damaging health impacts of DPM. To be protective, they need to act as effective filters against carbon and other particulates. In Australia, the <b>filtering</b> <b>efficiency</b> of respiratory protective devices is determined by challenging test filter media with aerosolised sodium chloride to determine penetration at designated flow rates. The methodology outlined in AS/NZS 1716 (Standards Australia International Ltd and Standards New Zealand 2012. Respiratory protective devices.
