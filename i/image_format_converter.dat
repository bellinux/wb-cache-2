40|$|Sandia National Laboratories` Product Realization Environment (PRE) is a lightweight, CORBA based {{framework}} for the integration of a broad variety of applications. These applications are wrapped {{for use in the}} PRE framework as reusable components. For example, some of the PRE components currently available include: (1) product data management (PDM) system, (2) human resources database, several finite element analysis programs, and (3) a variety of <b>image</b> and document <b>format</b> <b>converters.</b> PRE enables the development of end user applications (as Java applets, for example) that use these components as building blocks. To aid such development, the PreLib library (available in both C++ and Java) permits both wrapping and using these components without knowledge of either CORBA or the security mechanisms used...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{definition}} of a generic <b>format</b> <b>converter</b> that is accepting at its I/O both interlaced and progressive formats. These conversions make use of the general sampling theory which was proposed recently to handle interlaced images. This paper especially defines the 4 : 2 : 2 deinterlacer that has been used within the RACE 2110 /HAMLET project in order to study the coding efficiency of progressive sequences. 1 Introduction This paper describes the <b>format</b> <b>converter</b> used within HAMLET to test the influence of the scanning format on the coding efficiency [1, 2]. Although the HAMLET definition of a generic <b>format</b> <b>converter</b> and the work of RACE 2055 /TRANSIT, dealing with <b>image</b> <b>format</b> transcoding [3], are related, specificities of the coding application in HAMLET have been taken into account to lead to further developments. Unlike TRANSIT, the HAMLET Generic <b>Format</b> <b>Converter</b> (GFC) is basically meant to be placed in front of a coder, converting interlaced sources into progress [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, such as {{digital signal}} processing, data <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> {{are used to}} {{reformat}} the data transferred between processing modules. In VLSI implementations, these converters consume {{a large portion of}} the available resources. Various methods have been proposed to synthesize data <b>format</b> <b>converter</b> architectures while optimizing the number of registers used to store the data. In this paper, we present a new register allocation scheme which not only minimizes the number of registers, but also minimizes the power consumption in the data <b>format</b> <b>converter.</b> Low power data <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> are synthesized by minimizing the transitions and interconnections between the registers used to store the data. We present both a heuristic and an integer linear programming formulation to solve the allocation problem. Our method shows significant improvement over previous techniques. 1 Introduction Data <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> (DFCs) are used to permute the data from one format to another in [...] ...|$|R
