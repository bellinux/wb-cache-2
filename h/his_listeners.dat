5|$|Savage has {{previously}} given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund {{and his own}} personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> to nearly $150,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{moment he}} starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> spellbound by his {{sparking}} personality, reflected in his small, dark eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second part}} of the program has the segment [...] "MOONLIGHT LETTERS", and in this segment, DJ Richard is reading a letter from <b>his</b> <b>listener</b> and he plays a song which was {{requested}} by <b>his</b> <b>listener</b> which is written in the letter.|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Swift, as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although Swift is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, or the Drapier's Letters, Swift was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth Sunday. Of these sermons, Swift wrote down 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons Swift attempted to impart traditional Church of Ireland values to <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> in a plain manner.|$|E
5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and <b>his</b> <b>listeners,</b> he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging <b>his</b> <b>listeners.</b> Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
60|$|Stephen Hurd {{took off}} his hat and placed it upon the table before him. <b>His</b> <b>listener's</b> emotion was catching.|$|R

60|$|The wild {{bitterness}} {{with which}} this was uttered, {{and the energy}} of his language, struck thrilling chords on every nerve of <b>his</b> <b>listener.</b>|$|R
25|$|The three {{marks of}} {{existence}} may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms {{were already in}} use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to <b>his</b> <b>listeners.</b>|$|E
25|$|On Jan 23, 2008, Larry Elder read a {{statement}} from Al Rantel on the air at 6:30 PM announcing to <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> {{that he has been}} diagnosed with lymphoma and undergoing chemotherapy for it. Al's fill-in host Tammy Bruce also made the same announcement in her segment of the show.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney {{revealed}} {{that she had}} received a death threat from Hal Turner. She stated in the San Francisco Bay Review that Hal Turner 'announced to <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> in 2006 that I should be lynched {{on my way to}} vote.' Mr. Turner was on the FBI's payroll as an informant at the time.|$|E

25|$|Qudarat {{took refuge}} at Lake Lanao, where he {{delivered}} a famous speech against the Spanish, exhorting <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> to renounce submission and take up arms against the invaders. The speech was successful, and the Lake Moros soon recaptured the fort the Spanish had left behind. By 1637 Qudarat had extended his political influence over almost the whole of Mindanao.|$|E
25|$|As The Greaseman, Tracht {{invented a}} clever {{way of getting}} around limits on indecent {{language}} by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented. <b>His</b> <b>listeners</b> knew the meanings of the terms. In this way, he managed to directly discuss very explicitly adult topics without alerting censors, or alarming parents who {{did not understand the}} private language.|$|E
25|$|His tale {{then was}} about four men, each of them either a {{potential}} victim or potential murderer. The pacing {{of the story is}} quite slow and the narrative is interrupted from time to time by discussion between Brendel and <b>his</b> <b>listeners.</b> Even so, the novel maintains its interest on the reader throughout, partly because of the originality of its approach.|$|E
6000|$|The two old men {{once more}} {{looked at each}} other steadily. Then, lest the mood of <b>his</b> <b>listener</b> should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel began at once: ...|$|R
6000|$|... - The sad man ceased; and {{ceased to}} heed <b>His</b> <b>listener,</b> {{and crossed the}} leaze From Moaning Hill towards the mead - [...] The Mead of Memories.|$|R

Hudson hosts The Football Show with Charlie Stillitano, Neil Barnett, and Phil Schoen, which airs weekdays at 7am Eastern Time. <b>His</b> <b>listeners</b> {{refer to}} him as 'Rocky' which was his nickname back in his playing days. He {{is the centerpiece of}} Hudson's Howlers, a monthly feature highlighting his most outrageous comments.|$|E
25|$|Spurgeon was a {{prolific}} {{author of many}} types of works including sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, hymns, and more. Many sermons were transcribed as he spoke and were translated into many languages during his lifetime. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills held <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians hold his writings in exceptionally high regard among devotional literature.|$|E
60|$|He stole {{a glance}} at <b>his</b> <b>listener.</b> Mr. Silk, very pale and upright, was {{standing}} on the hearthrug, shaking all over with nervous excitement. Twice he tried to speak and failed.|$|R

6000|$|... "Isnâ€™t it true?" [...] inquired <b>his</b> <b>listener.</b> [...] "He says he {{can prove}} it. And {{he is going to}} find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of making mischief." ...|$|R
25|$|On 20 September 2010, Hinch {{confirmed}} the liver cancer diagnosis, {{and said that}} he expected to undergo surgery to remove a third of his liver, and that this would take him off-air for several weeks. Doctors gave him a 60 per cent chance of surviving a further five years. On 4 November 2010, Hinch told <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> that his doctors had told him that without a liver transplant, his maximum survival would be 12 months.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{an article}} by {{sociologist}} Erdmann Doane Beynon {{was published in the}} American Journal of Sociology, giving Beynon's first-hand account of several interviews that he conducted with followers of Fard in Michigan. From those interviews, Beynon wrote that Fard lived and taught in Detroit from 1930â€“34. He came to the homes of black families who had recently migrated to Detroit from the rural south. He began by selling silks door to door, telling <b>his</b> <b>listeners</b> that the silks came from their home country. At his suggestion, he came back to teach the residents, along with guests.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the new 24-hour {{radio station}} Time Highway Radio {{proved to be}} {{competition}} to RTM's existing radio stations. Hence RTM decided to re-brand Radio 4, and brought in new DJs such as Patrick and Yasmin Yusoff. Patrick's talk show slot was from 9 a.m. until 12 noon Mondays to Wednesdays. When Radio 4 went for 24-hour broadcast, Patrick also hosted a show in the 12 a.m. until 3 a.m. slot called 'Midnight Magic'. In Midnight Magic Patrick invited listeners to call in and tell ghost stories, a move {{that proved to be}} a hit among <b>his</b> <b>listeners.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have {{you heard}} in your {{metropolitan}} {{experience of a}} curious body of New Lights, as they think themselves?' The minister whispered a name to <b>his</b> <b>listener,</b> {{as if he were}} fearful of being overheard.|$|R
60|$|He put his leg up {{over the}} corner of March's table and gave himself a sharp cut on the thigh, and leaned forward {{to get the full}} effect of his words upon <b>his</b> <b>listener.</b>|$|R
