In this study, skin hair growth cycle abnormalities {{were examined in}} NIH hairless mice 42 days after birth (P 42) by using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. To examine the gene expression patterns in the skin of mutant mice, the dorsal skin of P 42 female NIH mice and NIH hairless mice was sequenced by RNA-Seq, and 5, 068 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] ≥ 2, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction: The high {{complexity}} and dynamic {{nature of the}} regulation of gene expression, protein synthesis, and protein activity pose a challenge to fully understand the cellular machinery. By deciphering the role of important players, including transcription factors, microRNAs, or small molecules, {{a better understanding of}} key regulatory processes can be obtained. Various databases contain information on the interactions of regulators with their targets for different organisms, data recently being extended with the results of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project. A systems biology approach integrating our understanding on different regulators is essential in interpreting the regulation of molecular biological processes. Implementation: We developed CyTargetLinker ([URL] a Cytoscape app, for integrating regulatory <b>interactions</b> in <b>network</b> <b>analysis.</b> Recently we released CyTargetLinker {{as one of the first}} apps for Cytoscape 3. It provides a user-friendly and flexible interface to extend biological <b>networks</b> with regulatory <b>interactions,</b> such as microRNA-target, transcription factor-target and/or drug-target. Importantly, CyTargetLinker employs identifier mapping to combine various interaction data resources that use different types of identifiers. Results: Three case studies demonstrate the strength and broad applicability of CyTargetLinker, (i) extending a mouse molecular <b>interaction</b> <b>network,</b> containing genes linked to diabetes mellitus, with validated and predicted microRNAs, (ii) enriching a molecular <b>interaction</b> <b>network,</b> containing DNA repair genes, with ENCODE transcription factor and (iii) building a regulatory meta-network in which a biological process is extended with information on transcription factor, microRNA and drug regulation. Conclusions: CyTargetLinker provides a simple and extensible framework for biologists and bioinformaticians to integrate different regulatory <b>interactions</b> into their <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches. Visualization options enable biological interpretation of complex regulatory networks in a graphical way. Importantly the incorporation of our tool into the Cytoscape framework allows the application of CyTargetLinker in combination with a wide variety of other apps for state-ofthe- art <b>network</b> <b>analysis.</b> Copyright: © 2013 Kutmon et al...|$|R

For instance, banks are directly connected through mutual exposures acquired on the interbank market.

Networks – broadly understood as a collection of nodes and links between nodes – can be a useful representation of financial systems. By modeling economic <b>interactions,</b> <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> can better explain certain economic phenomena. In this chapter, Allen and Babus argue that the use of network theories can enrich our understanding of financial systems. They explore several critical issues. First, they address the issue of systemic risk, by studying two questions: how resilient financial networks are to contagion, and how financial institutions form connections when exposed to the risk of contagion. While more links between banks might be expected to increase the risk of contagion, their research shows that banking systems with a more complete set of connections may be less susceptible to contagion than those with an incomplete structure.

The research approach emphasizes interactions and exchanges of knowledge and information among public and private agents in local networks. The empirical context for the analysis is a case study of the local production arrangement (APL), or cluster, of knitwear producers in Imbituva, Paraná, Brazil.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} principles governing the natural phenomena {{of life is}} one of the critical issues receiving due importance in recent years. Most complex real-world systems are found to have a similar networking model that manages their behavioral pattern. Recent scientific discoveries have furnished evidence that most real world networks follow a scale-free architecture. A number of research efforts are in progress to facilitate the learning of valuable information by recognizing the underlying reality in the vast amount of genomic data that is becoming available. A key feature of scale-free architecture is the vitality of the highly connected nodes (hubs). This project focuses on the multi-cellular organism Drosophila melanogaster, an established model system for human biology. The major objective is to analyze the protein-protein interaction and the metabolic network of the organism to consider the architectural patterns and the consequence of removal of hubs on the topological parameters of the two <b>interaction</b> <b>networks.</b> <b>Analysis</b> shows that both <b>interaction</b> <b>networks</b> pursue a scale-free model establishing the fact that real networks from varied situations conform to the small world pattern.

The arbitrary exclusion of the nodes does not show any remarkable disparity in the topological parameters of the two networks.
