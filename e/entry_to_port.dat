25|$|Admiral Togo {{set sail}} from Sasebo again on Sunday 14 February 1904, with all ships except for Fuji. On {{the morning of}} Wednesday 24 February 1904, {{an attempt was made}} to scuttle five old {{transport}} vessels to block the <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> <b>Port</b> Arthur, sealing the Russian fleet inside. The plan was foiled by Retvizan, which was still grounded outside the harbor. In the poor light, the Russians mistook the old transports for battleships, and an exultant Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev telegraphed the Tsar of his great naval victory. After daylight revealed the truth, a second telegram needed to be sent.|$|E

50|$|The {{schooner}} rig {{dominated the}} lumber trade, since its fore-and-aft rigging permitted sailing {{closer to the}} wind, easier <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> small <b>ports,</b> and smaller crews than square-rigged vessels. These ships needed to return <b>to</b> the lumber <b>ports</b> without the expense of loading ballast. Shipyards built some smaller schooners with centerboards that retracted. This helped the flat-bottomed vessels to enter shallow water.|$|R

The opening of the Sambri Pasha road (nowadays Venizelou Street) created a small square. It was initially called Plateia Apovathras (Dock Square) and later Plateia Olympou (Olympus Square). It instantly became the most cosmopolitan spot of the city. There was a restaurant called Olympos and a hotel called Olympos Palace along with numerous other hotels and bars {{on both sides of}} Venizelou Street.

25|$|Following {{the success}} of Portobelo, Vernon decided to focus his efforts on the capture of Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia. Both Vernon and Edward Trelawny, {{governor}} of Jamaica, considered the Spanish gold shipping <b>port</b> <b>to</b> be a prime objective. Since {{the outbreak of the}} war, and Vernon's arrival in the Caribbean, the British had made a concerted effort to gain intelligence on the defences of Cartagena. In October 1739, Vernon sent First Lieutenant Percival to deliver a letter to Blas de Lezo and Don Pedro Hidalgo, governor of Cartagena. Percival was to use the opportunity to make a detailed study of the Spanish defences. This effort was thwarted when Percival was denied <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the <b>port.</b>|$|R
40|$|Engineers (USACE) deep-draft coastal {{navigation}} entrance channel design practice and describes {{elements of a}} USACE research effort for improving this practice. NEEDS AND BENEFITS: Entrance channels are the initial points of <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> <b>ports</b> and harbors. Almost all of United States overseas trade by weight, and approximately 50 percent by value (air transport accounts for a greater fraction of precious cargo), moves through our Nation’s ports and harbors. The waterborne commerce through U. S. ports and harbors has increased continuously {{over the last four}} decades (U. S. Department of Transportation 1997; Webster 1992), and many <b>ports</b> are expanding <b>to</b> serve larger vessels. Economics of scale and increased containerization of cargo are producing containerships of increased size (U. S. Department of Transportation 1997), exceeding the dimensions of Panamax class ships (ma Canal maximum ship dimensions are 965 -ft length, 106 -e beam, and 39. 5 -I? draft). The economics of scale is applicable to all cargo classes and has fueled demand for port expansions, infrastructure capable of rapid on-and-off loading, larger stockyards, and efficient land-based facilities for truck and rail transport. With the ever-present political and economic pressures to serve larger vessels, ports are faced with planning for costly infrastructure upgrades...|$|R
50|$|Archeological {{evidence}} {{found on}} the Manette Peninsula suggests at least two, distinct periods of human settlement prior to the historic record. The first possibly beginning 7000 years ago. The people living on the Manette Peninsula {{at the beginning of}} the historic record were the Saktabsh band of the Suquamish. The Indian Fort at Point Herron was used <b>to</b> defend the <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Port</b> Washington Narrows from annual raids by northern coastal tribes from the areas now in Canada and Alaska (see also Haida).
