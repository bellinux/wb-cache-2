500|$|Shortly {{before the}} ruling was handed down in September 1976, Harrison wrote and {{recorded}} a song {{inspired by the}} court case – the upbeat [...] "This Song" [...] – which includes the line [...] "This tune has nothing 'Bright' about it". The 1960s soul hits [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" [...] and [...] "Rescue Me", {{as well as his}} own composition [...] "You", are all name-checked in the lyrics, as if to demonstrate the point that, as he later put it, [...] "99% of the popular music that can be heard is reminiscent of something or other." ...|$|E
500|$|Composed as a dance-oriented song, the intro of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] {{consists}} of two hooks. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a moderately dance-groove tempo of 118 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna's voice ranging from the tonal nodes of low-tone G3 to high-tone C5. According to Rikky Rooksby, the bassline on the intro is a re-working of the three-note bass motif present in the Four Tops' 1965 song [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)", where Chuck Berry provided the chord arrangement. The bassline also has some similarity with Michael Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean" [...] especially during the second verse. Madonna sings the song in her high register while drum arrangement by Tony Thompson is heard alongside the bassline, which is also supported by a synthesizer arrangement, giving it a circular progression through all the seven diatonic chords of I–IV–VIIo–III–VI–II–V–I.|$|E

500|$|Following Olivier's {{success in}} Shakespearean stage productions, {{he made his}} first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in As You Like It, {{directed}} by Paul Czinner, [...] "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute's (BFI's) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama Fire Over England. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of Romeo and Juliet, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that [...] "I couldn't <b>help</b> <b>myself</b> with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." [...] While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] at {{the first}} MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake dressed in a wedding dress, adorned with the infamous [...] "Boy Toy" [...] belt buckle, and veil. The climax of her risqué performance found her [...] "humping" [...] and rolling around on the stage. The song was subsequently performed at The Virgin Tour in 1985. Madonna again donned wedding attire and performed a straight version of the song featuring a quotation from Michael Jackson's similar-sounding Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience as she rolled around the stage, carrying a wedding bouquet in her hand. The performance {{was included in the}} VHS release [...] recorded in Detroit, Michigan. In the 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour, the song was given a lighthearted comedic theme and included quotations from The Four Tops' [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". Madonna took off her outfit piece by piece, until she was standing in a black corset, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was putting my tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made." [...] The title [...] "Who's That Girl Tour" [...] came to Madonna's mind during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. She commented, ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, labelmates the Four Tops' {{released}} [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)", {{which reached}} number one.

2500|$|The band also {{released}} a new 12" [...] only single which contained Wild on the Streets and I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself,</b> {{and was only}} available at concerts and specialised music stores. Sean Harris also wrote the lyrics to a song with Dave Mustaine for Megadeth called [...] "Crown Of Worms" [...] and both {{released a}}s a B-side to Megadeth's 1994 single Train of Consequences and on the re-mastered version of Countdown to Extinction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{group was}} the main male vocal group for the highly {{successful}} songwriting and production team of Holland–Dozier–Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles for Motown. These included two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" [...] in 1965 and [...] "Reach Out I'll Be There" [...] in 1966. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned {{to a number of}} producers, primarily Frank Wilson, but generally with less success.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their first}} number 1 hit, [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)" [...] in June 1965, the Four Tops {{released}} {{a long series}} of successful hit singles. Among the first wave of these hits were the Top 10 [...] "It's the Same Old Song", [...] "Something About You", [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)", and [...] "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever". Four Tops records often represented the epitome of the Motown Sound: simple, distinctive melodies and rhymes, call-and-response lyrics, and the musical contributions of studio band, the Funk Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|A newly adapted {{version of}} First Wives Club The Musical began previews at Chicago's Oriental Theatre on February 17, 2015, {{with the opening}} on March 11 and running through March 29. The {{production}} aimed for Broadway in the 2015-2016 season. The new production is directed by Simon Phillips, choreographed by David W. Connolly, and {{has a new book}} written by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. The newly adapted version features new songs by the composers Holland-Dozier-Holland, the trio that wrote lots of Motown hits during the 60s. The show also contains a few of their classic hits, such as [...] "Reach Out...I'll Be There," [...] "Stop! In the Name of Love" [...] and [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)." [...] Faith Prince, Christine Sherrill, and Carmen Cusack lead the cast as Brenda, Elise, and Annie respectively. Complete casting was announced in January 2015.|$|E

2500|$|... "Satisfaction" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in the US by London Records on 6 June 1965, with [...] "The Under-Assistant West Coast Promotion Man" [...] as its B-side. The single entered the Billboard Hot 100 charts in America in the week ending 12 June 1965, remaining there for 14 weeks, reaching the top on 10 July by displacing the Four Tops' [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". [...] "Satisfaction" [...] held the number one spot for four weeks, being knocked off on 7 August by [...] "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am" [...] by Herman's Hermits. While in its eighth week on the American charts, the single was certified a gold record award by the RIAA for shipping over a million copies across the United States, giving the band their first of many gold disc awards in America. Later the song was also released by London Records on Out of Our Heads in America. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song of 1965.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, McPhee {{was persuaded}} by {{eventual}} husband Nick Cokas {{and her parents}} {{to try out for}} the television series competition American Idol. She auditioned in San Francisco and sang [...] "God Bless the Child", originally performed by Billie Holiday, and was selected to be a participant in the fifth season, which aired in 2006. [...] After the first round of Hollywood week, she sang [...] "I'll Never Love This Way Again" [...] by Dionne Warwick which earned favorable comments from the judges. During the second round, she performed in a group, singing [...] "I Can't <b>Help</b> <b>Myself</b> (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" [...] by the Four Tops, forgetting the words, but the judges decided to advance the entire group. During the third round, she sang [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] a cappella and advanced to the top 40. She was angered when fellow group member Crystal Stark did not make the top 24. McPhee's run on American Idol led {{to the use of the}} term [...] "McPheever". The inclusion of producer David Foster and singer Andrea Bocelli as guest mentors for Top 6 Week turned out to be a fortuitous introduction for McPhee, as she has worked on various music projects with both men post-Idol. In May 2006, McPhee visited her alma mater Notre Dame High School for her hometown celebration. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa visited the school and proclaimed the day Katharine McPhee Day. She finished as the runner up to Taylor Hicks.|$|E
