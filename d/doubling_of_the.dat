5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's prison population. He worked {{across party lines}} to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged from nearly eight years of recession. His reforms to the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E

But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large {{increase in the number of}} free speech prosecutions, a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.|$|E

5|$|After Gallipoli the 7th Battalion was {{withdrawn}} to Egypt, where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to Europe. The 7th Battalion was split to provide a cadre for the 59th Battalion which was being raised {{as part of the}} <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian forces. In March 1916, they sailed to France where for the next two and half years they would take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Upon arrival, the battalion was sent to the Somme, where its first major action came in July during the Battle of Pozières. Throughout July and into August, the battalion was committed to the fighting twice, losing 55 men killed in the first battle and another 83 in the second.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, NSB {{announced}} that the traffic around Trondheim would become the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, which would take {{over most of the}} Class 92 trains. The service started on 1 September 1993. The changes to the schedule involved almost a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of departures, particularly between Trondheim and Stjørdal, where a one-hour headway was introduced. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. While local trains had existed previously north of Trondheim, the services south to Oppdal were all new in an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains. The initial services consisted of four services from Trondheim—northwards along the Nordland Line to Steinkjer, east along the Meråker Line to Storlien, south along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and south-east along the Røros Line to Tynset.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{an upgrade}} of the Drammen Line to {{accommodate}} more trains started in 1991. This {{resulted in the}} Asker Line, which was built in two steps between 2005 and 2011. Ahead of the section stage, consisting of the Bærum Tunnel which would allow trains to run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika, Lysaker Station received a full modernization. The upgrades consisted of demolishing the existing station and building a new station with two island platforms. Snøhetta won the architecture competition for the station. The upgrades allowed several advantages: seven minutes shorter travel time west of Oslo combined with better regularity, trains previously turning at Skøyen Station could instead turn at Lysaker and a near <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of trains running through the West Corridor, allowing eleven more trains per hour.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to a <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saudi population by 1985. Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as Thailand, Philippines and South Korea, increasingly provided migrant workers.|$|E
