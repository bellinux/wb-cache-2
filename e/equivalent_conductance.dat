Criteria applied to room-temperature conductances for determining complete ionization of 1 - 1 electrolytes were applied to the Noyes high-temperature conductance data obtdined on NaCl, HCl, KCl, NaOH, AgNO 3, and H/sub 3 /PO/sub 4 / solutions. lt was found that the first four electrolytes behave as strong electrolytes up through temperatures of 218, 218, 281, and 156 deg C, respectively. Application of the Bjerrum theory showed that, somewhat above each of these temperatures, these electrolytes begin to associate by ion-pair formation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) [...] Boston UniversityConductivity {{data have}} been {{obtained}} for solutions in liquid sulfur dioxide for ionophores composed of either spherically symmetrical or planar ions. Established methods have been employed to secure thermodynamic equilibrium constants (Kesp.) and limiting <b>equivalent</b> <b>conductances</b> from the data. By arbitrarily adopting the crystallographic radius of the potassium ion as both its radius of closest approach in ion pairs and its hydrodynamic radius in liquid sulfur dioxide solution and assuming that the radius of an ion is independent of its counter ion, three "radii" can be assigned to each ion: (1) R(cryst.), the crystallographic ionic radius of elemental ions and, for other ions, the radius calculated from bond distances and angles and van der Waals radii; for planar ions this is taken as the longest radius about the center of gravity. (2) R(SO 2), the Bjerrum radius, calculated from Kexp. by means of Bjerrum's equation. (3) R(Stokes), the hydrodynamic radius calculated from the limiting <b>equivalent</b> <b>conductances</b> by means of Stokes' equation. Values of the three radii are assembled in Table I. Agreement among the various radii of the anions is remarkable. In every case excellent agreement is found among R(Stokes), R(cryst.), and R(SO 2), except for BF 4 - and CLO 4 -. For each of the latter two ions R(SO 2) is virtually identical with the van der Waals radius of oxygen (1. 4 A) and fluorine (1. 35 A) respectively. For most of the cations, R(SO 2) is in excellent agreement with R(cryst.). However, R(Stoked) {{for each of these}} cations is much smaller than R(SO 2) or R(cryst.). It has therefore been established that for liquid sulfur dioxide surprisingly good agreement is observed between Bjerrum distances of closest approach (a) calculated from Kexp. and sums of ionic radii for both spherical and disk shaped ions. Further, the mobility of the anions measured is accurately predicted by Stokes Law assuming crystallographic or van der Waals radii.

The case of decomposition of the instantaneous capacities of the fixed and variable components for 3 -wire system. The features of power balance for the different modes of its functioning. It {{should be noted that}} symmetric sinusoidal mode is balanced and good, but really unbalanced, if the standard reactive power is not zero. To solve the problem of compensation is sufficient knowledge of the total value of the inactive components of full power (value of the inactive power) without detail. The creation of a methodology of measurement and assessment will require knowledge of the magnitudes of each inactive component separately, which leads to the {{development of}} a unified approach to the measurement and compensation of inactive components of full power and the development of a generalized theory of power. Results. Procedure for the compensation of the current of zero sequence excludes from circuit the source, as the active component of instantaneous power of zero sequence, and a vector due to a current of zero sequence. This procedure is performed without time delay as it does not require integration. Only a 3 –wire system with symmetrical voltage eliminates pulsations and symmetrization of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>conductances</b> of the phases of the task. Under asymmetric voltage, the power is different, its analysis requires the creation of a vector mathematical model of the energy processes of asymmetrical modes of 3 –phase systems. Originality.

The limiting <b>equivalent</b> <b>conductance</b> (λ 0) and the ion-association constant (KA) for Li-Picrate in (PC+THF) solvents at different percentage were evaluated using Debye-Huckel Onsager equation. It is observed that the limiting <b>equivalent</b> <b>conductance</b> increased linearly {{with the increase in}} temperature and the association constant values decreased with rise in temperature. Thermodynamic parameters (i. e, G 0, H 0, S 0) are estimated from the temperature dependence of the ion-association constant. The positive values of S 0 and positive values of H 0 indicate the ion-association process occurred spontaneously as well as endothermic at all respective temperature. Supported by absorbance data from this primary study, it may be concluded that room temperature solubility of Li-Picrate in mixed (PC+THF) solvents at different percentage is higher than the higher temperatures. Conductivity data helps us to concluded that if we go from room temperature to higher temperature conductance increases for Li-Picrate in (PC+THF) solvents at different percentage.

40|$|Water {{stress is}} among the {{dominant}} yield limiting factors in global crop production. Better drought resistance is therefore a key challenge for breeding and crop management. Avoidance of water stress by effective root water uptake is considered a promising approach to yield stability in water limiting environments. Water uptake efficiency {{is the result of}} multiple plant root traits that dynamically interact with site hydrology. Root models are therefore an essential tool to identify key root traits for water efficient crops in a certain target cropping environment. We present a novel combination of a dynamic root architecture model (RootBox) with a functional model of root xylem hydraulic properties and soil water flow (R-SWMS). This model integrates structural and functional root traits to simulate water uptake under variable hydrological conditions. Application of the model is exemplified for three different maize root phenotypes. We evaluate the role of root architectural and functional traits to deal with water stress at the flowering stage under two contrasted hydrological conditions (deep water storage vs. moist upper profile layer in silt loam) for a 7 -day period. The phenotypes include a reference phenotype (P 1), one phenotype with steeper main roots (P 2), and one with steep main roots and with longer lateral roots (P 3) We showed that generally those phenotypes whose root axes allocation matched with available water distribution were able to transpire more. This synchronization is a result of root architecture (structural root traits). The temporal dynamics of water depletion on the contrary were essentially determined by root hydraulic properties. We showed that lower <b>equivalent</b> root <b>conductance</b> is essentially related to a water saving behaviour of the plant, while high root conductance contributes to a water spending type with high initial transpiration that decreases quickly over time.). We also showed the dramatic importance of root hydraulic property distribution, and their relation to root order and root age, in determining <b>equivalent</b> root <b>conductance</b> and water uptake behaviour. In our simulations, increasing the radial conductivity of lateral roots by a factor 10 had more impact in the total transpiration than having different root architecture traits. It emphasizes the importance to consider not only architectural traits but also hydraulic properties in defining ideotypes and to use quantitative methods to build and test them. Our results confirmed that functional-structural root models are appropriate to better understand the role of roots in whole plant adaptation to different drought scenarios and their contribution to distinct drought response types. The newly developed model contains all basic components to further refine complex root processes such as architectural plasticity, dynamic root conductance (xylem vulnerability, composite radial transport) and root exudation. These results could feed into cropping system models to see the effect of these processes on crop yield...|$|R

Indirect measurements of recurrent inhibition have suggested only a weak modulatory effect but are limited by the lack of observed motoneuron responses to inputs from single RCs. Here we present dual recordings between connected RC–motoneuron pairs, performed on mouse spinal cord. Motoneuron responses demonstrated that Renshaw synapses elicit large inhibitory conductances and show short-term potentiation. Anatomical reconstruction, combined with a novel method of quantal analysis, showed that the strong inhibitory input from RCs results from the large number of synaptic contacts that they make onto individual motoneurons. We used the NEURON simulation environment to construct realistic electrotonic models, which showed that inhibitory conductances from Renshaw inputs exert considerable shunting effects in motoneurons and reduce the frequency of spikes generated by excitatory inputs. This was confirmed experimentally by showing that excitation of a single RC or selective activation of the recurrent inhibitory pathway to generate <b>equivalent</b> inhibitory <b>conductances</b> both suppress motoneuron firing. We conclude that recurrent inhibition is remarkably effective, in that a single action potential from one RC is sufficient to silence a motoneuron.

A series of four experiments was performed in the PhenoArch image-based phenotyping platform (M 3 P, France) with contrasting soil water status and evaporative demand.

A GWAS analysis was performed on all variables presented above, suggesting interesting candidate genes related to hydraulics and other mechanisms. Surprisingly, no co-location was observed between QTLs of stomatal conductance and of sensitivity to soil water deficit, supporting the idea that the controls of stomatal opening/photosynthesis and of leaf expansion are largely independent...|$|R
