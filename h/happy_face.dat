Twenty-seven subjects viewed 18 s blocks of either fearful or <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> masked with either neutral faces or patterns, while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results replicated increased amygdala activation to face-masked fearful vs <b>happy</b> <b>faces.</b> In the pattern mask condition, the amygdala discriminated between masked fearful and <b>happy</b> <b>faces,</b> but this effect manifested as a decrease in activation to fearful <b>faces</b> compared to <b>happy</b> <b>faces.</b> This interactive effect between facial expression and mask stimulus shows that amygdala responses to masked fearful faces {{are influenced by the}} fearful stimuli per se as well as their interaction with the mask stimulus...|$|R

25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a <b>happy</b> <b>face</b> before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the <b>happy</b> <b>face</b> bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} the band also {{recorded}} their debut album on <b>Happy</b> <b>Face.</b> Most {{commonly known as}} Lightning to the Nations, the collection was recorded in seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in Worcester, which the band described later as 'dead'. The album was packaged in a plain sleeve with no title or track listings, simply bearing a signature {{of one of the}} band members. The management thought that it should be perceived as a 'demo' album so no fancy sleeve was required, making it very cheap to produce. the first 1000 copies were pressed and made available at concerts or via mail-order for £3.50. The only mail-order advertisement appeared in Sounds and ran for six weeks. The bands management did not pay for the advertisement and ended up being sued. The idea for recording this album came from Fellows and Linda Harris as an attempt to record tracks to entice attention from a record company, which would take care of the recording costs.|$|E

Just after arriving at the dorms, the girls are taken to get flu shot. Weeks after, they are weighed and do a series of exercises with the help of trainer Ray Yang. Some girls are put on a strict diet in order to lose weight. The trainees are also tricked into participating in a 'hidden camera'. The first is a consideration test to see who will help a staff struggling with two heavy packs of water bottles. The second is a puddle of coke which was spilled {{on the floor of a}} waiting room to see if they will clean it up. The third is a $30,000 camera which a staff pretends to break during a fake interview.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} has a {{key role}} in automatic non-conscious processing of emotions. Highly salient emotional stimuli elicit amygdala activity, and <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> are among the most rapidly perceived facial expressions. In backward masking paradigms, an image is presented briefly and then masked by another stimulus. However, reports of amygdala responses to masked <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> have been mixed. In the present Study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine amygdala activation to masked happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Masked <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> elicited greater amygdala activation bilaterally as compared to masked sad faces.

500|$|While {{eating breakfast}} at Rita's house, Dexter {{is called to}} a crime scene, only to {{discover}} that it is the same salvage yard where he committed a double murder the previous night. He finds Valerie Castillo's (Valerie Dillman) body lying in the Airstream trailer where he killed her and her husband Jorge (José Zúñiga), despite having thrown the corpses into the ocean. He deduces that the [...] "Ice Truck Killer"—a serial killer with whom Dexter has a personal connection—dived underwater to retrieve the woman's body and plant it in the trailer. In the yard, LaGuerta, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) discover a young Cuban boy, Oscar (Cesar Flores), hiding in the trunk of a car who claims to have seen somebody take Valerie into the trailer. He begins to fear discovery, and experiences his first nightmare: Debra is a serial killer with an identical modus operandi to Dexter. As the investigation proceeds, he attempts to shoot down each of his colleagues' leads on the case. When Debra asks him to read through her report on the killer, profiling a man sharing many of Dexter's characteristics, he second-guesses her theory and she is hurt. Worried about coming under suspicion, he throws all of his knives overboard from his boat, but while looking at the blood drops from his victims, he notices that Valerie's slide has a <b>happy</b> <b>face</b> etched into the blood. He realizes that this is a hint from the Ice Truck Killer, and plants Jorge's fingerprints and a dry drop of Valerie's blood onto a knife, which he hides in a car at the salvage yard. He convinces Doakes to organize another search of the yard, where an officer (Denver Dowridge) finds the knife. After successfully framing Jorge for Valerie's murder, Dexter discovers that Oscar's description of the man who [...] "saved" [...] him from Valerie is in fact Jesus Christ.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} in crowds of faces angry faces are detected fastest, whereas, other research suggests that <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> are found fastest. The current study aimed to explain some of these differences. Ninety-three first year psychology students completed a series of computer-based visual search tasks. Experiment 1 examined the effect of search strategy on search performance. Angry faces were found faster than <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> during both fixed and variable target searches. Experiment 2 comprised a series of follow-up tasks assessing the effect of emotional non-targets and teeth displays on search performance. Faster detection of angry faces was still evident after the removal of emotional non-targets and when using closed-mouth stimuli. A third follow-up task revealed faster detection of <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> when faces from a different stimulus set were used. These results suggest that differences in the literature cannot be entirely explained by search strategy, teeth displays, or presence of emotional non-targets, and demonstrate the influence of stimulus choice on the pattern of results...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous mimicry is {{a marker}} of empathy. Conditions {{characterized}} by reduced spontaneous mimicry (e. g., autism) also display deficits in sensitivity to social rewards. We tested if spontaneous mimicry of socially rewarding stimuli (<b>happy</b> <b>faces)</b> depends on the reward value of stimuli in 32 typical participants. An evaluative conditioning paradigm was used to associate different reward values with neutral target faces. Subsequently, electromyographic activity over the Zygomaticus Major was measured whilst participants watched video clips of the <b>faces</b> making <b>happy</b> expressions. Higher Zygomaticus Major activity was found in response to <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> conditioned with high reward versus low reward. Moreover, autistic traits {{in the general population}} modulated the extent of spontaneous mimicry of <b>happy</b> <b>faces.</b> This suggests a link between reward and spontaneous mimicry and provides a possible underlying mechanism for the reduced response to social rewards seen in autism...|$|R

40|$|Inability {{to engage}} with {{positive}} stimuli is a widespread problem associated with negative mood states across many conditions, from low self-esteem to anhedonic depression. Though attention retraining procedures have shown promise as interventions in some clinical populations, novel procedures {{may be necessary to}} reliably attenuate chronic negative mood in refractory clinical populations (e. g., clinical depression) through, for example, more active, adaptive learning processes. In addition, a focus on individual difference variables predicting intervention outcome may improve the ability to provide such targeted interventions efficiently. To provide preliminary proof-of-principle, we tested a novel paradigm using operant conditioning to train eye gaze patterns toward <b>happy</b> <b>faces.</b> Thirty-two healthy undergraduates were randomized to receive operant conditioning of eye gaze toward <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> (train-happy) or neutral faces (train-neutral). At the group level, the train-happy condition attenuated sad mood increases following a stressful task, in comparison to train-neutral. In individual differences analysis, greater physiological reactivity (pupil dilation) in response to <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> (during an emotional face-search task at baseline) predicted decreased mood reactivity after stress. These Preliminary results suggest that operant conditioning of eye gaze toward <b>happy</b> <b>faces</b> buffers against stress-induced effects on mood, particularly in individuals who show sufficient baseline neural engagement with <b>happy</b> <b>faces.</b> Eye gaze patterns to emotional face arrays may have a causal relationship with mood reactivity. Personalized medicine research in depression may benefit from novel cognitive training paradigms that shape eye gaze patterns through feedback. Baseline neural function (pupil dilation) may be a key mechanism, aiding in iterative refinement of this approach...|$|R
