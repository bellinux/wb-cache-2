5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Environmental</b> Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E

40|$|School {{environmental}} education {{is viewed as}} fundamental <b>in</b> solving <b>environmental</b> issues, while also {{playing a role in}} the lifemovement effort. However, it is still perceived as a field that simply transmits knowledge and principles related to the environment. As the source of the current environmental crisis is closely tied to values and attitudes towards the environment, environmetal ethics is essential <b>in</b> approaching <b>environmental</b> issues. This study aims to analyze methods used <b>in</b> school <b>environmental</b> education from the perspective of environmental ethics and suggests areas for reform <b>in</b> school <b>environmental</b> education...|$|R

5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} surplus {{to push through}} Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.

5|$|Chromium is the 22nd most {{abundant}} element in Earth's crust {{with an average}} concentration of 100 ppm.

50|$|<b>In</b> the <b>environmental</b> {{law of the}} United States, {{relationships}} between state and federal parties often shape environmental laws and the practical impact of those laws. <b>In</b> addition, <b>environmental</b> problems often do not have well defined boundaries and thus jurisdictional overlap complicate these matters. These complications bring into question how environmental laws are created, how these laws should be enforced, and whether the state or federal government should have the final word <b>in</b> specific <b>environmental</b> debates.|$|R
50|$|A perceptual trap is an {{ecological}} scenario <b>in</b> which <b>environmental</b> change, typically anthropogenic, leads an organism {{to avoid an}} otherwise high-quality habitat.

5|$|From 1981 {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 2003, Miskovsky worked for Kirkland & Ellis, where he specialized <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> law. In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network, a free legal clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal legal issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social security checks. Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting other lawyers for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration of animals <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals {{that have been}} engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals.

5|$|In {{addition}} to writing on process {{approaches to the}} environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian environmental ethics more broadly, urban environmental ethics, and scholarship on the environment {{in the work of}} English writers.

5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing <b>in</b> <b>environmental</b> planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030.

In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
