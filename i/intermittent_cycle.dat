The growth of the secondary instability does not saturate in a new equilibrium, but continues until highly unstable local shear layers form and the entire flow breaks down into turbulence.

Early speculation regarding the aetiology of fatigue commends that high rate of lactic acid production and a concomitant fall in blood and muscle pH [1], which may have multiple indirect and dir-ect impairing effects on centrally and peripherally medi-ated fatigue-resistance. Caffeine and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) are two supplements frequently consumed to elicit ergogenic effects on high-intensity exercise performance [2].

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{response to}} two {{different forms of}} high intensity <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycle</b> exercise was investigated in young females. Subjects (8 trained and 8 untrained) performed two bouts of high intensity intermittent exercise: short sprint (SS) (8 s sprint, 12 s recovery) and long sprint (LS) (24 s sprint, 36 s recovery) for 20 min on two separate occasions. Both workload and oxygen uptake were greater in the trained subjects but {{were not significantly different}} for SS and LS. Plasma glycerol concentrations increased during exercise but peaked earlier for the trained women. Lactate concentrations rose over the 20 min and were higher for the trained women. Catecholamine concentration was also higher postexercise when compared to pre-exercise for both groups. Both SS and LS produced similar metabolic response although both lactate and catecholamines were higher after the 24 s sprint. In conclusion, these results show that high intensity intermittent exercise resulted in significant elevations in catecholamines that appear to be related to increased venous glycerol concentrations. Trained compared to the untrained women tended to show increased plasma glycerol concentrations, earlier during high intensity exercise.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper we introduced {{the notion of}} frustrated chaos occurring in Hopfield networks [Neural Networks 11 (1998) 1017]. It is a dynamical regime which appears in a network when the global structure is such that local connectivity patterns responsible for stable oscillatory behaviors are intertwined, leading to mutually competing attractors and unpredictable itinerancy among brief appearance of these attractors. Frustration destabilizes the network and provokes an erratic 'wavering' among the orbits that characterize the same network when it is connected in a non-frustrated way. In this paper, through a detailed study of the bifurcation diagram given for some connection weights, we will show that this frustrated chaos belongs {{to the family of}} intermittency type of chaos, first described by Berge et al. [Order within chaos (1984) ] and Pomeau and Manneville [Commun. Math. Phys. 74 (1980) 189]. Indeed, the transition to chaos is a critical one, and all along the bifurcation diagram, in any chaotic window, the duration of the <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycles,</b> between two chaotic bursts, grows as an invert ratio of the connection weight. Specific to this regime are the <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycles</b> easily identifiable as the non-frustrated regimes obtained by altering the values of these same connection weights. We will more specifically show that anywhere in the bifurcation diagram, a chaotic window always lies between two oscillatory regimes, and that the resulting chaos is a merging of, among others, the cycles at both ends. The strength (i. e. the duration of its oscillatory phase before the chaotic burst) of the first cycle decreases while the regime tends to stabilize into the second cycle (with the strength of this second cycle increasing) that will finally get the control. Since in our study, the bifurcation diagram concerns the same connection weights responsible for the learning mechanism of the Hopfield network, we will discuss the relations existing between bifurcation, learning and control of chaos. We will show that, in some cases, the addition of a slower Hebbian learning mechanism onto the Hopfield networks makes the resulting global dynamics to drive the network into a stable oscillatory regime, through a succession of intermittent and quasiperiodic regimes. Finally, we will present a series of possible logical steps to manually construct a frustrated network. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Six healthy subjects repeated 30 bouts of <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycle</b> exercise with a work: recovery ratio of 15 s: 10 s. The exercise workloads were 90 % and 100 % of maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Changes in oxygenation in the vastus later-alis muscle were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Muscle oxygenation levels showed the pattern of that the decrease during every work period and the increase during recovery. From the onset of exercise at each workload, muscle oxygenation levels declined and then reached the minimum during the 2 nd work period. However there was no difference between the two intensities. After the 25 th pedalling a dynamic steady state for muscle oxygenation level was observed. The mean values of muscle oxygenation during last six work periods were 61. 8 ± 7. 3 % (mean±SD) and 54. 8 ± 11. 2 % at 90 % and 100 %, respectively. While the values for recovery periods were 79. 9 ± 8. 6 % and 72. 7 ± 15. 0 %, respectively. The values for both periods at 100 %VO 2 max were lower (p 0. 05). These data indicate a consequence of the interaction between work and recovery period, and it can be considered that the NIRS curve presented here is a typical change in muscle oxygenation during intermittent exercise...|$|E

Ten healthy young adults (age, 23. 8 ± 3. 9 year; height, 172. 3 ± 5. 5 cm; body mass, 67. 7 ± 6. 1 kg) with regular training experience ingested L-ornithine hydrochloride (0. 1 g/kg, body mass) or placebo after 30 s of maximal cycling exercise. Five sets of the same maximal cycling exercise were conducted 60 min after ingestion, and maximal cycling exercise was conducted after a 15 min rest. The intensity of cycling exercise was based on each subject's body mass (0. 74 N kg - 1). Work volume (watt), peak rpm (rpm) before and after intermittent maximal ergometer exercise and the following serum parameters were measured before ingestion, immediately after exercise and 15 min after exercise: ornithine, ammonia, urea, lactic acid and glutamate.

Fractional tubular reabsorption of Na(+) in the proximal tubules was higher in Ex than in C (P < 0. 05). Saline loading decreased fractional tubular reabsorption of Na(+) from 99. 1 +/- 0. 1 to 98. 7 +/- 0. 1 % (P < 0. 05) in C but not in Ex (99. 3 +/- 0. 1 to 99. 4 +/- 0. 1 %). Saline loading reduced plasma renin activity and plasma arginine vasopressin levels in C and Ex, although the magnitude of decrease was greater in C (P < 0. 05).

By utilising renewable thermal energy from the environment, that is, air, ground or water sources, significant reduction of primary energy use can be achieved. However, high cost, low coefficient of performance (COP) and large volume per unit thermal power produced have limited the proliferation of GDSHPs. In this work, exploiting the benefits of reversible chemical reactions in sorption systems, with no internal moving parts, noise, vibration and maintenance-free reactor design, two novel modular prototype sorption components were developed and evaluated experimentally. They were designed to operate {{as part of an}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycle</b> GDSHP to deliver heat directly to a load or to a stratified hot water store.

The administration of <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycles</b> of IL- 2 to HIV-infected patients can lead to profound increases (often greater than 100 %) in CD 4 cell number and percentage. Using in vivo labeling with 2 H-glucose and BrdU, {{we have been able to}} demonstrate that, although therapy with IL- 2 leads to high levels of proliferation of CD 4 as well as CD 8 lymphocytes, it is a remarkable preferential increase in survival of CD 4 cells (with half-lives that can exceed 3 years) that is critical to the sustained expansion of these cells. This increased survival was time-dependent: the median half-life, as determined by semiempirical modeling, of labeled CD 4 cells in 6 patients increased from 1. 7 weeks following an early IL- 2 cycle to 28. 7 weeks following a later cycle, while CD 8 cells showed no change in the median half-life. Examination of lymphocyte subsets demonstrated that phenotypically naive (CD 27 +CD 45 RO–) as well as central memory (CD 27 +CD 45 RO+) CD 4 cells were preferentially expanded, suggesting that IL- 2 can help maintain cells important for host defense against new antigens as well as for long-term memory to opportunistic pathogens...|$|R

Methods: Twelve males completed an <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycle</b> protocol in hot (35. 1 ± 0. 3 °C), humid (68 ± 2 %) conditions to dehydrate by 1. 9 ± 0. 3 % body mass in the evening. Twice they were then fed and rehydrated, while on two other occasions they were fed the same meal but remained hypohydrated. The following morning they were given 1 l of beer to drink. On two occasions the beer was alcohol-free, while on the other two occasions the same beer contained 4 % ethanol. Participants remained in the laboratory for monitoring over the subsequent 4 h. Blood and urine samples were taken prior to dehy-dration, prior to drink administration and once every hour of the monitoring period. Results: No difference existed in the volume of urine produced between the alcohol (261 ± 138 ml; mean±SD) and non-alcohol (174 ± 61 ml) beer when hypohydrated (P= 0. 057), but there was a difference when euhydrated (1279 ± 256 vs 1121 ± 148 ml alcohol and non-alcohol, respectively; P< 0. 001). Unsurpris-ingly, more urine was produced on both euhydrated trials than either of the hypohydrated trials (P< 0. 001).

Creatinine clearance was significantly higher and free water clearance was significantly lower in FF than in NF during exercise. Urine flow rate during exercise decreased significantly in NF. There were significant decreases in creatinine and osmolar clearance and was a significant increase in free water clearance during exercise in NF and VF. Creatinine clearance decreased significantly and free water clearance increased significantly during exercise in PF. There was no statistical change in urinary indices of renal function during exercise in FF. The findings suggest that full fluid ingestion equivalent to body mass loss has attenuated the decline in urine concentrating ability during prolonged heavy exercise in a hot environment at low levels of dehydration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterized the functional nature of the reentrant tract responsible for ventricular tachycardia due to ischemic heart disease. Background. A zone of slow conduction forming the return path is thought to form a critical component of the reentrant mechanism in ventricular tachycardia. Despite its importance, detailed knowledge of the return path is rare in clinical studies. Methods. Multielectrode arrays were used intraoperatively to obtain unipolar and high gain bipolar recordings of left ventricular endocardium in patients undergoing map-directed surgical ablation of ventricular tachycardia. A total of 224 local elerograms were analyzed for each tachycardia. Results. Of 10 consecutive patients undergoing intraoperative cardiac mapping, detailed recordings of the return tracts of eight ventricular tachycardias were obtained in three patients. The recordings demonstrated that returnstracts can be complex and extensive, with multiple paths of entry and exit. Potential and actual alternate paths were observed. Spontaneous and induced block occurred within portions of the complex. Intermittent block in one of two paths of entry resulted in <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycle</b> length changes of the tachycardia without a change in configuration. Block in one exit path resulted in a shift to alternative exit paths, with dramatic changes in ventricular activation and tachycardia configuration. Termination of the tachycardia could result from block close to the entrant or exit portion of the return tract. Different tachycardias were seen to share common portionsof a return tract. Conclusions. These observationis enlarge and extend our knowledge of the functional repertoire of complex reentrant tracts that occur in infarct-related ventricular tachycardia. The use of common portions of a reentrant tract by several tachycardias is confirmed. Utilization of alternate pathways can account for changes in configurationi and cycle length. Spontaneous and induced block can occur at points of entry and exit in a reentrant tract and may identify optimal targets for ablation attempts. Further advances will require greater emphasison diastolic activation mapping...|$|E
40|$|The {{important}} task of nevrology {{is to improve}} the diagnosis of chronic progressive degenerative and vascular brain diseases – to detect them at the earliest stages. The paper presents current views on the non-dementia stages of brain diseases: moderate, mild, and subjective cognitive impairments. It sets forth data on their prevalence and clinical features and types, as well as international diagnostic criteria. There is evidence for the expediency of the earliest neuroprotective therapy to prevent dementia. A methodology for neuroprotective therapy is discussed; the available data on the long-term effect of <b>intermittent</b> treatment <b>cycles</b> with the vasotropic and neurometabolic drug tanakan are given...|$|R
40|$|Administration of {{interleukin}} (IL) – 2 {{to human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) –infected patients leads to signifi-cant increases in CD 4 T cell counts. We previously have shown that IL- 2 induces increased proliferation and survival of CD 4 T cells. Deuterium labeling studies were undertaken to study the relationship between IL- 2 – induced increases in the CD 4 T cell count {{and the effects of}} IL- 2 on cell proliferation and survival. A strong inverse correlation was noted between the rate of decay of the label in CD 4 cells and increases in CD 4 cell counts (R 0. 67; P<. 001). This correlation was not seen with the level of proliferating cells. Although the CD 4 cell count at baseline and the number of CD 4 cells expressing CD 25 were also predictive of increases in the CD 4 cell count, the rate of decay remained the most statistically significant predictor in multivariate regression models. Thus, an increase in the survival of CD 4 T cells appears to be the critical mechanism leading to sustained increases in the CD 4 cell counts of HIV-infected patients receiving intermittent IL- 2 therapy. Treatment of HIV- 1 –infected patients with <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycles</b> of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) leads to significant and sustained increases in CD 4 T cell counts. This effect has been demonstrated in a number of randomized trials and is a result of a selective increase in the number o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment of {{psoriasis}} in {{the setting}} of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is diffcult, because standard therapies like methotrexate are associated with increased hepatic toxicity. Due to the HCV suppressive effect. Cyclosporine may represent a valid systemic alternative for psoriatic-HCV patients. Objectives: In this study, we report the successful usage of <b>intermittent</b> <b>cycles</b> of cyclosporine {{in the setting}} of chronic HCV infection and we try to call the attention once again in a very effective and forgotten therapeutic option for severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Observation: We describe a 48 years - old patient who has a 20 year history of severe chronic plaque psoriasis and HCV infection (aminotransferase levels are three times normal; HCV genotype 2 a- 2 c and HCV-RNA titer of 2. 050. 000 UI-ml). Five courses (range of duration of three to six months) of oral cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) were followed during a 38 month period. The viral load and the transaminases’ levels diminished during the 38 months of intermittent cyclosporine therapy to the lowest level measured at 36 th month. The good psoriatic response was associated to a slight improvement of the liver condition, even though the HCV-RNA was reduced by less than 1 log 10 without normalization of aminotransferase’ levels. Conclusions: The reduced liver toxicity, the potential anti-HCV properties and the well-known systemic anti-inﬂammatory effect, make cyclosporine a good alternative for recalcitrant psoriatic patients with HCV-liver disease...|$|R
