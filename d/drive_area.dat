500|$|In Haiti, Hazel {{destroyed}} 40%of {{the coffee}} trees and 50%of the cacao crop, affecting the economy {{for several years}} to come. The hurricane made landfall near Calabash, North Carolina, and destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact. From North Carolina, it traveled north along the Atlantic coast. Hazel affected Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York; it brought gusts near [...] and caused $281million (1954 USD) in damage. When it was over Pennsylvania, Hazel consolidated with a cold front, and turned northwest towards Canada. When it hit Ontario as an extratropical storm, rivers and streams in and around Toronto overflowed their banks, which caused severe flooding. As a result, many residential areas located in the local floodplains, such as the Raymore <b>Drive</b> <b>area,</b> were subsequently converted to parkland. In Canada alone, over C$135million (2016: $1.2billion) of damage was incurred.|$|E
