40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{assessing}} the efficacy of filling a 50 % mixture of nitrous oxide : oxygen (50 %N 2 O:O 2) in the endotracheal tube cuff to provide stable cuff pressures during general anaesthesia with 67 %N 2 O. The endotracheal tube cuff pressures with air (control) as the <b>inflating</b> <b>agent</b> in the tubes {{were found to have}} a total mean pressure of 62. 60 ± 12. 33 {{at the end of one}} hour of general anaesthesia. When comparing the endotracheal tube cuff pressures in the Mallinckrodt tubes with that of the Portex tubes, with air as the <b>inflating</b> <b>agent,</b> the Portex tubes showed a significantly lower cuff pressures at the end of one hour. The endotracheal tube cuff pressures with 50 %N 2 O:O 2 as the <b>inflating</b> <b>agent</b> showed a total mean pressure of 27. 63 ± 3. 221 at the end of one hour of general anaesthesia. This indicates that inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tubes with a 50 %N 2 O:O 2 rather than air maintains a stable intra cuff pressure. Therefore, the method of using a 50 %N 2 O:O 2 for filling endotracheal tube cuff can be adopted for endotracheal tubes with high-volume, low-pressure cuffs to prevent both excessive cuff pressure and disruption of cuff seal, during general anaesthesia lasting up to one hour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{tennis ball}} {{adhesive}} formula is optimized {{by studying the}} impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent {{on the performance of}} NR-based tennis ball adhesive. The optimizing formula of rubber is: NR 100, Carbon Black N 220 30, ZnO 8. 3, Stearic Acid 2. 2, Phenolic Tackifying Resin 3, Sulfur 3, Accelerator D 0. 5. The adhesive made through such optimizing formula shows good performance and the finished tennis ball has excellent adhesion and air tightness, satisfying the design requirements. Intorduction The excellent elasticity of tennis ball is provided by the internal air inflation. Therefore, air retaining of tennis ball is an important influencing factor of its performance, which is not only related with the air tightness of tennis ball bladder, but also closely related with the adhesion of tennis ball. The vulcanization of tennis ball is very unique. Firstly, it vulcanizes the rubber into two hemispheres and puts in <b>inflating</b> <b>agent.</b> Then, these two hemispheres will be bonded together for secondary vulcanization. This indicates that the bonding of tennis ball is the bonding between vulcanized rubbers, which is more difficult than that between unvulcanized rubbers. Therefore, firm adhesion requires experiment on the adhesive formula in order to gain qualified tennis ball adhesive. This paper optimized the tennis ball adhesive formula by studying the impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent on the performance of NR-based tennis ball adhesive...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and mesoscopic structural properties of rigid cellular foam made of polystyrene have been investigated. Basic properties (e. g., density, total and available porosity, permeability, surface area, isotropicity, and cell size and cell wall thickness distributions) were measured. In most cases, alternative methods {{were used to}} determine which methods were most appropriate for the type of samples we studied. Standard compression and deflection mechanical tests were performed. The stress-strain curves and related mechanical properties were found to agree with standard cellular structural models of open-cell foams. We investigated the effects of small (3 ̆c 5 atm) hydrostatic stress applied to foam samples {{for long periods of time}} (one day). We observed large changes (up to a factor of three) in the stress-strain diagrams, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, elastic collapse stress, ultimate strength, resilience, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, permeability, penetration depth, and available porosity. Effects were most pronounced above 2 atm applied pressure differential, but were observed even for 1 atm loads. Short-term exposure to loads up to ten times as large did not cause comparable changes. These changes were interpreted as resulting from observed changes in the mesoscopic structure occurring near the surface using standard cellular structural models. This work was originally motivated by applications of foam as an <b>inflating</b> <b>agent</b> and structural component of fiber-epoxy composite tubular struts to be used in innovative space structures. The key recommendations of this study, regarding such applications, are to closely monitor the effects on the mechanical properties of polystyrene foam of: (1) cell structure and density inhomogeneities, and (2) pressure differentials which may be encountered during deployment and curing...|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the <b>inflating</b> radiocontrast <b>agent</b> to simply escape into the blood.|$|R
500|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, public {{interest}} {{grew in the}} low-mintage gold dollar. [...] Collecting coins was becoming more popular, {{and a number of}} numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value. The Mint most likely channeled its production through some favored Philadelphia dealers, though proof coins could be purchased for $1.25 at the cashier's window at the Philadelphia facility. Banks charged a premium for circulation strikes. [...] They were popular in the jewelry trade, mounted into various items. [...] The coins were often exported to China or Japan, where such jewelry was made. [...] The dollars were often damaged in the process; the Mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it. Nevertheless, Mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue. Proof mintages exceeded 1,000 by 1884, and remained above that mark {{for the remainder of the}} series, numbers likely <b>inflated</b> by <b>agents</b> of jewelers, willing to pay the Mint's premium of $.25 per coin. Another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift; after its abolition the quarter eagle became a popular present.|$|R
