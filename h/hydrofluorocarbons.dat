5|$|The {{only known}} {{dihalide}} of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, {{which can be}} obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesize <b>hydrofluorocarbons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E
5000|$|R-407C is a zeotropic <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> {{blend of}} R-32, R-125, and R-134a. The R-32 serves {{to provide the}} heat capacity, R-125 {{decreases}} flammability, R-134a reduces pressure.|$|R
5000|$|... 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane, or R-143a {{or simply}} trifluoroethane, is a <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> {{compound}} {{that is a}} clear, colorless gas. It {{should not be confused}} with the much more commonly used gas R-134a or the isomeric compound 1,1,2-trifluoroethane.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} is {{the lowest}} mass member of the <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC) family, compounds which contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. These {{are related to the}} Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)s, but since they do not contain chlorine, are not destructive to the ozone layer.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other {{greenhouse}} {{gases in the}} Paris Agreement, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> have other international negotiations.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} process, {{patented by}} Graham M. Keyser, uses lasers to selectively dissociate deuterated <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> to form deuterium fluoride, which {{can then be}} separated by physical means. Although the energy consumption for this process is much less than for the Girdler sulfide process, this method is currently uneconomical due to the expense of procuring the necessary <b>hydrofluorocarbons.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs): when {{derived from}} methane, ethane, propane, and butane, these {{compounds}} have the respective formulae CFmH4−m, C2FmH6−m, C3FmH8−m, and C4FmH10−m, where m is nonzero.|$|E
3000|$|... sWidely used ODSs are CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbons and {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} (HCFC). In {{the beginning}} HCFC {{was used as}} a substitute for some CFCs, but later was also substituted with other compounds such as <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC) that have zero ozone depletion threat.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{refrigerants}} are {{substances that}} are viable, environmentally sustainable, natural substitute refrigerants, used in refrigeration systems (including refrigerators, HVAC, and air conditioning). They are alternatives to <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants. Unlike other refrigerants, {{they are not}} synthetic chemicals that are not ever found in nature.|$|R
5000|$|Trifluoromethane and {{chlorodifluoromethane}} {{are both}} used as refrigerants in some applications. Trihalomethanes {{released to the}} environment break down faster than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), thereby doing much less damage to the ozone layer [...] Chlorodifluoromethane is a refrigerant HCFC, or hydrochlorofluorocarbon, while fluoroform is an HFC, or <b>hydrofluorocarbon.</b> Fluoroform is not ozone depleting.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{concerns}} {{developed over}} the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the ozone layer. By 1996, almost all nations had banned chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued {{to play a role}} in refrigeration though: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) were developed as replacement refrigerants.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> and perfluorocarbons (see IPCC list of greenhouse gases). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, the {{so-called}} New York Declaration urged a global {{reduction in the}} use of HFCs. On 15 October 2016, due to these chemicals contribution to climate change, negotiators from 197 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme in Kigali, Rwanda reached a legally-binding accord to phase out <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.|$|E
5000|$|Blended of pure, dry propane (refrigerant {{designator}} R-290) and isobutane (R-600a) {{the blend}} [...] "R-290a" [...] has negligible {{ozone depletion potential}} and very low global warming potential and {{can serve as a}} functional replacement for R-12, R-22, R-134a and other chlorofluorocarbon or <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.|$|R
25|$|This {{chemical}} is an inhalational anaesthetic studied only {{in animals}} in 1967, and toxicology investigations did not acknowledge this fact. All <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> inhaled anaesthetic agents have smooth muscle relaxing properties, so the propellant gas produced by pMDIs using HFA134a and HFA227ea (which has no anaesthetic activity) {{will add to}} beta2-agonist bronchodilating drugs from that inhaler.|$|R
50|$|Several inhaled general {{anesthetic}} agents, {{including the}} most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, halothane, proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used. Modern fluorinated anesthetics are longer-lasting still and almost insoluble in blood, which accelerates the awakening. Examples include sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane, all <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> derivatives.|$|R
25|$|Industrial {{pollutants}} such as <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have a GWP {{many thousands}} of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume. Because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source, they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets. As a category, HFCs, PFCs, and N2O reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the CDM.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene foams are {{produced}} using blowing agents that form bubbles {{and expand the}} foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane, which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact. Extruded polystyrene is usually made with <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFC-134a), which have global warming potentials of approximately 1000–1300 times that of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning of}} fossil fuels is a major source of {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, especially for power, cement, steel, textile, fertilizer and many other industries which rely on fossil fuels (coal, electricity derived from coal, natural gas and oil). The major greenhouse gases emitted by these industries are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs), etc., all of which increase the atmosphere's ability to trap infrared energy and thus affect the climate.|$|E
25|$|One widely adopted {{replacement}} refrigerant is the <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC) {{known as}} R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant {{ozone depletion potential}} and a somewhat lower global warming potential. Other substances such as liquid R-717 ammonia are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane, can also be used.|$|R
40|$|HFC- 134 a (CF 3 CH 2 F) is {{the most}} rapidly growing <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> in terms of {{atmospheric}} abundance.

25|$|Haloalkanes {{can also}} be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} halogen on group 7 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. Haloalkanes containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used haloalkanes are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs). These abbreviations are particularly common in discussions of the environmental impact of haloalkanes.|$|E
25|$|Although CFCs are {{greenhouse}} gases, {{they are}} {{regulated by the}} Montreal Protocol, which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media. On 15 October 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at {{the summit of the}} United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{are fully}} {{halogenated}} paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly {{known by the}} DuPont brand name Freon. The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|E
50|$|Attacking all the {{elements}} of the fire tetrahedron, condensed aerosol fire suppression agents are among the more effective flame-extinguishing agents. For example, some condensed aerosol fire suppressants can extinguish a Class B flammable liquid pool fire with 1/5 the amount of Halon 1301 agent or 1/10 the amount of a <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> or fluoroketone based clean agent gaseous fire suppression system in terms of kilogram mass of agent per cubic meter.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{closed-cell}} {{spray foam}} is now formed using <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC) blowing agents that have high global warming potential, partially or completely offsetting the climate {{benefits of the}} energy savings they can offer [...] In the United States, HFCs {{are scheduled to be}} phased out by January, 2021. A few spray foam suppliers have started supplying spray foam blown with HFO blowing agents without this problem as of early 2017.|$|R
5000|$|... 1,2-Difluoroethane is a {{saturated}} <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> containing an atom of fluorine {{attached to}} each of two carbons atoms. The formula can be written CH2FCH2F. It is an isomer of 1,1-Difluoroethane. It has a HFC name of HFC-152 with no letter suffix.When cooled to cryogenic temperatures it can have different conformers, gauche and trans. In the liquid form these are about equally abundant and easily interconvert. As a gas it is mostly the gauche form.|$|R
25|$|The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) {{are less}} stable {{in the lower}} atmosphere, {{enabling}} them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, HFC-134a, is now used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the USA and many other countries, as they have excellent thermodynamic properties and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|The interim {{replacements}} for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, {{but to a}} much lesser extent than CFCs. Ultimately, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) will replace HCFCs. Unlike CFCs and HCFCs, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0. [...] DuPont began producing <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning. <b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> {{are included in the}} Kyoto Protocol because of their very high Global Warming Potential and are facing calls to be regulated under the Montreal Protocol due to the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change.|$|E

Ongoing success depends on several steps: ...|$|E
5000|$|Isobutane {{is used as}} a refrigerant. [...] The use in {{refrigerators}} {{started in}} 1993 when Greenpeace presented the Greenfreeze project with the German company Foron.
