5000|$|A {{retort pouch}} is {{constructed}} from a flexible metal-plastic laminate that {{is able to}} withstand the thermal processing used for sterilization. The food is first prepared, either raw or cooked, and then sealed into the retort pouch. The pouch is then heated to 240-250°F (116-121°C) for several minutes under high pressure inside a retort or autoclave machine. The food inside is cooked {{in a similar way}} to pressure cooking. This process reliably kills all commonly occurring microorganisms (particularly Clostridium botulinum), preventing it from spoiling. The packaging process is very similar to canning, except that the package itself is flexible. The lamination structure does not allow permeation of gases from outside into the pouch.

50|$|These {{are similar}} to cement mills, but often with a larger gas flow. The gas {{temperature}} is controlled by cold-air bleeds to ensure a <b>dry</b> <b>product</b> without overheating the mill. The product passes into an air separator, which returns oversized particles to the mill inlet. Occasionally, the mill is preceded by a hot-air-swept hammer mill which {{does most of the}} drying and produces millimetre-sized feed for the mill. Ball mills are rather inefficient, and typically require 10-20 kW·h of electric power to make a tonne of rawmix. The Aerofall mill is sometimes used for pre-grinding large wet feeds. It is a short, large-diameter semi-autogenous mill, typically containing 15% by volume of very large (130 mm) grinding balls. Feed can be up to 250 mm, and the larger chunks produce much of the grinding action. The mill is air-swept, and the fines are carried away in the gas stream. Crushing and drying are efficient, but the product is coarse (around 100 µm), and is usually re-ground in a separate ball mill.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of cultured cream {{begins with}} the standardization of fat content, this step {{is to ensure that}} the desired or legal amount of milk fat is present in the food system. As previously mentioned the minimum amount of milk fat that must be present in sour cream is 18%. During this step in the manufacturing process other dry ingredients are added with the cream, additional grade A whey for example would be added at this time. Another type of <b>dry</b> <b>product</b> that is added during this processing step are a series of ingredients known as stabilizers. The common stabilizers that are added to sour cream are polysaccharides and gelatin. Recall the ingredients in sour cream include the following components that act as stabilizers; modified food starch, guar gum, and carrageenans. The reasoning behind the addition of stabilizers to fermented dairy products (sour cream, yoghurt, etc.) is provide smoothness in the body and texture of the product. The stabilizers also assist in the gel structure of the product and reduce whey syneresis. The formation of these gels structures, leaves less free water for whey syneresis, therefore extending the shelf life. Whey syneresis is the loss of moisture by the expulsion of whey. This expulsion of whey can occur during the transportation of containers holding the sour cream, due to the susceptibility to motion and agitation. The next step in the manufacturing process is the acidification of the cream. Organic acids such as citric acid or sodium citrate are added to the cream prior to homogenization in order to increase the metabolic activity of the starter culture. To prepare the mixture for homogenization, it is heated {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were; 1) to design and develop a microwave vacuum dehydration system; 2) to commission and test the microwave vacuum dehydration system and 3) to compare the effectiveness with conventional dehydration methods. A microwave vacuum dehydration system was successfully developed for dehydration of heat sensitive materials such as biological and agricultural products. Microwave is recognized as a fast heating process characterised by volumetric heating. Contrary to conventional dehydration method which heats {{from the surface of}} material, microwave heats material from inside out. Incorporation of vacuum enhances the microwave dehydration process by allowing water to vaporize at lower temperature. Thus, dehydration of heat sensitive materials can be achieved at low temperature and shorter time thereby preventing degradation of nutritional values and texture. Commissioning and testing of the developed microwave vacuum dehydration system showed that the system is capable to produce good quality of dehydrated products. This can be achieved by adjusting microwave power and vacuum pressure. In comparison of different dehydration methods for jackfruit, it was found that vacuum microwave dried sample had higher rehydration potential, better in colour, aroma and structure, lower density and softer texture than hot air <b>dried</b> <b>products.</b> The hot air <b>dried</b> <b>products</b> were darker in colour, hardness and shrunken. Less discolouration and structural changes occurred in vacuum microwave drying. Although freeze <b>dried</b> <b>product</b> was the highest in rehydration potential and structural retention, the vacuum microwave <b>dried</b> <b>product</b> however was rated as equal to or better than freeze <b>dried</b> <b>products</b> in terms of colour, aroma and overall preference in both the dehydrated and rehydrated state...|$|R
