5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the law. Shortly after {{the law was}} passed, questions arose about {{the legal status of}} marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Bethune {{was known}} as a strict Augustinian canon, a priest living a monastic life but not a monk. Bethune was often {{appointed}} a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes, which had been referred back to England by the popes. The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that {{he was a man of}} wide outlook, with a great desire for reform. He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese. He also held synods in his diocese, including two <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of his episcopate.|$|E

5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal ligation.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, {{as well as to}} multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> depend {{on whether or not}} a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E

5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years. The output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of operation.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> {{of life was}} 130% to 173%, slightly faster than {{the growth rate of}} alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham {{started his}} career at his local club Manchester United, but was not highly rated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of his {{apprenticeship}} and his career was almost ended when he broke his femur in a B team match. However, he recovered well from the injury and was given a two-year professional contract in 1998.

5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability. Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship between Washington and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of his presidency. Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E

More material is available in a pamphlet, An Expose of the Practice of the Palace, or Marshalsea Court, written in 1833 by an anonymous eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler {{until the end of}} her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants were always confirmed with Mary's own great seal <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E

5|$|Plane Food was {{announced}} in December 2007 to launch upon the opening of Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 5 on 27 March 2008. It was Gordon Ramsay's ninth restaurant opening in London, and his first in an airport. It was opened {{around the same time}} as Ramsay's first restaurant in France, Gordon Ramsay au Trianon, located within the Palace of Versailles. He also expanded his restaurant empire in other areas during 2008, with Murano (alongside Angela Hartnett), York & Albany and Maze Grill also opening. Partly due to the delays in opening the terminal, the restaurant made a loss of £780,767 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Raid on Genoa {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the harbour of the Italian city of Genoa <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of the French Revolutionary Wars. French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered {{the loss of their}} principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. The survivors of the French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at Genoa and Impérieuse at Leghorn.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of World War I, Göring {{served with}} his {{infantry}} regiment {{in the area}} of Mülhausen, a garrison town less than 2km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with rheumatism, a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the Luftstreitkräfte ("air combat force") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in Feldflieger Abteilung 25 (FFA 25)– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time {{it was supposed to be}} imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince's Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the Iron Cross, first class.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of his administration, Jones {{and five}} others were {{traveling}} {{in a state}} helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them {{for the survival of}} the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
