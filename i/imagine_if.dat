25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. <b>Imagine</b> <b>if</b> you were to observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if {{a huge number of}} customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E

One comment to The Guardian read: [...] "To suggest that people who disagree with you deserve to die is incredibly stupid. <b>Imagine</b> <b>if</b> some Christian group in the US did that to gays, Muslims or anyone else they disagree with. The outrage would be palpable. And deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen criticised the song's {{instrumental}} music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, {{comparing it to}} the music of the pre-rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated. According to Blaney, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions; lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to communism. Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions. Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to <b>imagine</b> <b>if</b> the world could live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up. Blaney commented: [...] "Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{daughter}} of billionaire Nikolas Natchios {{and the love}} interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so <b>imagine</b> <b>if</b> I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I <b>imagine,</b> <b>if</b> you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

[...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future."

[...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you <b>imagine</b> <b>if</b> I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: <b>Imagine</b> <b>if</b> you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!"

2500|$|For example, <b>imagine</b> <b>if</b> a {{hypothetical}} mutual fund had bought some Washington Mutual corporate bonds in 2005 {{and decided to}} hedge their exposure by buying CDS protection from Lehman Brothers.
