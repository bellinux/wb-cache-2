50|$|The {{original}} source, the ethnographical {{report by}} Walter Roth, discussed the Yurlayurlanya {{case in the}} context of tribes practicing both sub-incision on males and, in this case, <b>introcision</b> on females. It is a ceremonial rite, following a corroboree. A girl who is recognized as having achieved full puberty is enticed out of the camp by an aged woman, the pretext being to harvest papa-seed. The <b>introcision</b> transforms her from a wapiri to a kanari. The first copulation is followed by her being adorned with red and white bands of charcoal and feather-down, fixed by the blood from her wound. After successive copulations, the semen is scooped into a coolamon and, mixed with water, used as a curative for the sick and elderly males. On completion of the rite, the initiated young woman may then wear a variety of ornaments, such as kangaroo teeth on her forehead, and a grass necklace.|$|E
