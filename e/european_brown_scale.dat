40|$|Abstract Background In Denmark {{and many}} other European countries, harvest records suggest a marked decline in <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers, a decline often {{attributed}} to the agricultural practice. In the present study, we analyse the association between agricultural land-use, predator abundance and winter severity {{on the number of}} <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hares harvested in Denmark in the years 1955 through 2000. Results Winter cereals had a significant negative association with <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers. In contrast to this, root crop area was positively related to their numbers. Remaining crop categories were not significantly associated with the <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers, though grass out of rotation tended to be positively related. The areas of root crop production and of grass out of rotation have been reduced by approximately 80 % and 50 %, respectively, while the area of winter cereals has increased markedly (> 70 %). However, <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers were primarily negatively associated with the number of red fox. Finally, we also found a positive association between mild winters and <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers. Conclusion The decline of Danish <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare populations can mainly be attributed to predation by red fox, but the development in agricultural land-use during the last 45 years have also affected the <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hare numbers negatively. Additionally, though mild winters were beneficial to <b>European</b> <b>brown</b> hares, the increasing frequency of mild winters during the study period was insufficient to reverse the negative population trend. </p...|$|R
