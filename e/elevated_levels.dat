5|$|In about 90% {{of cases}} of neuroblastoma, <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of catecholamines or their {{metabolites}} {{are found in the}} urine or blood. Catecholamines and their metabolites include dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA), and/or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).|$|E
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. <b>Elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of pesticides in wax and pollen, but {{the amounts of}} pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|During the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested {{positive}} for <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of {{uric acid}} in the blood. This occurs due to a {{combination}} of diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project.

The study claimed to find evidence both of <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E

5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E

It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have <b>elevated</b> <b>levels</b> of copper on their skin. The cause for this was {{uncertain}} as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the results of {{troponin}} I (cTnI) in non- acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also examined the risk factors for elevated cTnI in non-ACS patients with CKD and whether stage 5 CKD modifies the associations of elevated cTnI and the risk factors in non-ACS patients with CKD. Methods: A retrospective study was performed. Logistic regression models were used. Results: 293 non-ACS patients with CKD were included in the current study. 43. 34 % non-ACS patients with CKD have an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level</b> and 5. 12 % have an <b>elevated</b> cTnT <b>level</b> in MI range. In CKD patients without ACS and heart failure, only 26. 03 % (38 / 146) patients have an <b>elevated</b> cTnT <b>level.</b> In adjusted analyses, age, diastolic blood pressure and congestive heart failure is associated with an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level</b> in non-ACS patients with CKD. Congestive heart failure is associated with an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level</b> in non-ACS patients with CKD (OR 2. 30, 95 % CI 1. 08, 4. 88, P= 0. 03). Stage 5 CKD does not modify the association of congestive heart failure and an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level.</b> Conclusion: 43. 34 % non-ACS patients with CKD and 26. 03 % CKD patients without ACS and congestive heart failure have an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level.</b> Congestive heart failure is associated with an <b>elevated</b> cTnI <b>level</b> in non-ACS patients with CKD.
