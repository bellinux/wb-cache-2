40|$|Abstract Database {{design is}} one step in making data {{processing}} applications both desktop and web-based applications. There are several techniques {{that can be}} used to design a database, one of them with <b>Entity</b> <b>Relationship</b> <b>Diagram</b> techniques. It’s one of the techniques taught in the course of Database Design. In fact, many students who have difficulty in designing a database with this technique. The use of appropriate learning techniques to optimize learning of database actively, attractive and effective is needed. The method used in the learning process is problem-based learning methode. So, the authors conducted a study to examine how the use of Problem Based Learning as an effective method of learning the technique of designing a database with <b>Entity</b> <b>Relationship</b> <b>Diagram.</b> It’s descriptive research, and used the Pre-experimental design with one group pretest-posttest design. This study used a class as an experimental class. This research method describes the influence of problem-based learning model in the ability to design database with <b>Entity</b> <b>Relationship</b> <b>Diagram</b> in Information Management students at AMIK BSI Karawang. The research sample is taken from class 12. 2 D. 15 and 20 students were taken as sample for testing and research. The hypothesis with ’t’ test showed that designing a database with <b>Entity</b> <b>Relationship</b> <b>Diagram</b> technique using problem based learning show better results than without using it. This shows that the implentation of problem-based learning in learning database design with <b>Entity</b> <b>Relationship</b> <b>Diagram</b> technique has a significant effect on the ability of students in designing database.     Keywords: Problem Based Learning, database, Entity Relationship Diagra...|$|E

A need in the accounting education curriculum is thus {{the understanding of the}} nature of information systems and their development, use and control. A simplified form of an <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>diagram,</b> used in information systems analysis, is used to set up a conceptual model of the roles of the accountant in producing accounting information. The conceptual model is decomposed into a set of diagrams which are shown in orthogonal form against learning levels.

40|$|In 1993 Kennedy {{identified}} three elementary structures into which any <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>diagram</b> may be decomposed. He later investigated {{the use of}} elementary structure counts {{as the basis of}} a metric for effort estimation, but found very poor correlation. Some question was raised about the counting strategy employed and about the reliability of the effort data used, both of which could have contributed to the unsatisfactory results. In order to refine methods for counting elementary structures in the <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>diagram</b> some mechanism for assigning relative importance to particular entities is necessary. One approach is for the developer to make this decision, but this then precludes the possibility of automation.
