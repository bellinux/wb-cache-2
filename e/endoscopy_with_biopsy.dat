40|$|Traditionally, {{contiguous}} {{distribution of}} inflammation (endoscopic and histological) with rectal involvement {{is thought to}} be important in distinguishing ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's disease of the colon. Little long-term data are available that prove whether this rule holds during the course of disease as it is modified by time and treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of endoscopic and histological patchiness and rectal sparing in treated UC over time and to correlate these findings with treatment at the time of endoscopy. Methods : Patients with well-established UC who underwent sequential colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> were included in this study. Patients’ medical records including endoscopy/biopsy reports and clinical status/symptoms/treatment at the time of endoscopy were reviewed retrospectively. Results : A total of 32 patients (14 men, 18 women; median age, 45 yr; median UC duration, 15 yr) underwent 175 sequential <b>endoscopies</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> (161 colonoscopies, 14 sigmoidoscopies; median, five endoscopies per patient; range, 3 – 10). Endoscopic and/or histological patchiness was present in 20 of 175 (11 %) sequential <b>endoscopies</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> over time from 12 of 32 (38 %) patients. Endoscopic and/or histological rectal sparing was present in 27 of 175 (15 %) of sequential <b>endoscopies</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> over time from 14 of 32 (44 %) patients. Seven patients had both patchiness and rectal sparing. Therefore, in 47 (27 %) follow-up endoscopies in 19 (59 %) patients, there was either patchy disease, rectal sparing, or both sometime during the course of disease with treatment. There was no significant difference in treatment, including steroid use and rectal therapy, between those with patchiness and/or rectal sparing and those without. Conclusions : Contrary to traditional teaching, endoscopic and histological patchiness of inflammation and rectal sparing are common during the course of disease in treated UC and seem to be unrelated to specific therapy...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{celiac disease}} (CD) {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} duodenal histology, {{with the exception of}} children showing anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) serum levels exceeding ten times the cut-off. Our aim was to reproduce this simplified approach in adults, identifying an anti-tTG threshold value useful to diagnose CD without endoscopic procedures. Methods: A total of 671 adult CD patients were subjected to blood sampling to determine anti-tTG serum levels, as well as to <b>endoscopy</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsy</b> to perform duodenal histology. The anti-tTG serum levels/cut-off ratio was compared with the degree of duodenal lesions. Results: Anti-tTG serum levels/cut-off ratio determined in patients with type IIIc was significantly higher than that measured in patients with type IIIb (p 3. 6 (sensitivity = 76. 8 %, PPV = 97. 2 %). Conclusions: The anti-tTG serum levels/cut-off ratio correlates with the degree of duodenal lesions and, if used with the threshold value > 3. 6, could avoid <b>endoscopy</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsy</b> in about 75 % of seropositive adults waiting for CD diagnosis.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether reinfection or recrudescence {{accounts for the}} reappearance of Helicobacter pylori infection after apparent successful eradication. In a prospective study, 173 patients cured from H. pylori infection underwent follow-up <b>endoscopies,</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> for culture and histopathology, every 3 months {{during the first year}} after treatment. Subsequently, elective half-yearly endoscopies were performed in 124 patients; the remaining 49 underwent follow-up endoscopy only in 1995. At reappearing infection, DNA profiles of pretreatment and recurrent strains were compared. After 3. 5 years (range, 1. 0 - 9. 2), H. pylori infection recurred in 9 patients (5. 2 %). Reappearing infections were classified as endoscopically transmitted reinfection (n = 2), unclassified because of loss of pretreatment isolate (n = 1), or recrudescence (identical DNA patterns before and after treatment; n = 6). The reappearance rate of infection, discarding endoscopic transmission, was 1. 2 % (7 / 601 H. pylori-negative patient-years).

40|$|Background: The 13 C-urea {{breath test}} (UBT) for {{detecting}} Helicobacter pylori infection is a non-invasive method {{based on the}} organism’s urease activity. Since its first description, the method has been extensively modified. However, only the dose of 13 C-urea and the measurement equipment {{are directly related to}} the cost of the test. Aims: (1) To assess the diagnostic accuracy before eradication therapy of three UBTs using 25, 15, and 10 mg of 13 C-urea, respectively; and (2) to determine diagnostic performance in the post-eradication setting showing the highest values for sensitivity and specificity with the lowest dose of 13 C-urea. Methods: Three hundred consecutive patients were randomised to be tested with one of the three UBTs. All patients underwent upper <b>endoscopy</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies.</b> A total of 222 more patients were enrolled to evaluate the second aim.

This article presents {{the case of a}} 76 -year old women diagnosed with pimary esophageal SmCC. The diagnosis was established by upper gastrointestinal <b>endoscopy</b> <b>with</b> <b>biopsies</b> that confirmed an esophageal SmCC positive to synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD 56, TTF- 1, and cytokeratin 8 / 18. Further staging procedures included CT, PET and EUS, followed by combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Restaging was then performed, again with PET and CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. This was then followed by salvage esophagectomy due to the presence of residual tumor. Surgical pathology confirmed a 3 cm SmCC, with invasion of the submucosa and lymphovascular invasion. In conclusion, the article describes the rare occurrence of esophageal SmCC, together with the algorithm of diagnosis and staging based on state-of-the-art imaging methods.
