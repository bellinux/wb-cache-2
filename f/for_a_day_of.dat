5|$|After almost 22 {{months of}} construction, {{the road was}} opened <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> free travel on October 20, 1956 between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. An {{estimated}} 12,000 to 15,000 cars traveled on the turnpike. Many of those motorists traveled to Lawrence for a football game between the University of Kansas and University of Oklahoma. Official opening ceremonies were held at interchanges {{in each of the}} three major cities on October 25. The Kansas City celebration included Gene Autry jumping his horse through a large paper map of the turnpike. John Masefield, the British Poet Laureate, wrote a tribute to commemorate the occasion. On the first day after the official opening, 7,197 vehicles traveled the turnpike, with 81 toll collectors and 50 maintenance workers on duty. The turnpike originally had 14 interchanges; by 2012, there were 22.|$|E

It was only when Knott joined World Series Cricket in 1977 that Taylor appeared in more Tests and was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. He continued to be England's choice keeper through the 1970s, falling three short of a maiden Test century in the 1978-79 Ashes, and retiring from Tests in 1984 – though he would make an emergency appearance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Test cricket in 1986 – and all first-class cricket in 1988.|$|E

500|$|In {{hopes of}} {{bringing}} the mounting crisis under control, the General Court called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> fasting and repentance to be held on Thursday, 19 January 1637. [...] During the Boston church service held that day, Cotton invited Wheelwright {{to come forward and}} deliver a sermon. [...] Instead of the hoped-for peace, the opposite transpired. [...] In the sermon Wheelwright stated that those who taught a covenant of works were Antichrists, and all the ministers besides Cotton saw this as being directed at them, though Wheelwright later denied this. [...] During a meeting of the General Court in March Wheelwright was questioned at length, and ultimately charged with sedition, though not sentenced.|$|E

The Burgesses, who had been elected by propertied freeholders throughout the colony, moved to Raleigh Tavern to continue meeting. The Burgesses declared support for Massachusetts {{and called for a}} congress of all the colonies, the Continental Congress. The Burgesses, convened as the First Convention, met on August 1, 1774, and elected officers, banned commerce and payment of debts with Britain, and pledged supplies. [...] They elected Peyton Randolph, the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, as the President of the Convention (a position he held for subsequent conventions until his death in October 1775).|$|E

During the appointed fast-day on Thursday, 19 January 1637, Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon. To the Puritan clergy, his sermon was [...] "censurable and incited mischief." [...] The colony's ministers were offended by the sermon, but the free grace advocates were encouraged, and they became more vociferous in {{their opposition to the}} [...] "legal" [...] ministers. Governor Vane began challenging the doctrines of the colony's divines, and supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the Pequot War of 1637 because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition. [...] Ministers worried that the bold stand of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the [...] "Puritan's holy experiment." [...] Had they succeeded, historian Dunn believes that they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history.|$|E

500|$|The Reverend John Wheelwright {{had arrived}} in the colony in May 1636, {{aligning}} himself with the free grace advocates who adhered to Cotton's doctrines, which included most {{of the members of the}} Boston Church. [...] The controversy became much more political when, in the same month, the young aristocrat, Henry Vane, was elected as the governor of the colony. [...] Vane was a free grace advocate and a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but also had his own unorthodox ideas about theology that were considered radical. [...] By late 1636 the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties. [...] Wheelwright had been invited as a guest preacher to the Boston church on the fast-day in January 1637, and though his sermon was encouraging to his free grace allies, it was considered inflammatory by most of the colony's ministers.|$|E
