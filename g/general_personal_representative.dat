500|$|The {{ease with}} which the HV {{achieved}} victory surprised many observers as Western intelligence services predicted a Croatian defeat. International reactions to Operation Storm quickly evolved from emotive arguments, supportive of either side in the battle, to those calmly assessing {{the situation on the}} ground. UN officials and most international media criticised Croatia. Carl Bildt, an EU negotiator working for the former Yugoslavia, publicly condemned Croatia, while UN Special Representative Stoltenberg urged the UN Secretary <b>General</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>Representative</b> Yasushi Akashi to request NATO strikes against the HV. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed regret but added that [...] "...the years of Serb aggression... have sorely tried Croatia's patience". The US response was mixed. While Secretary of Defense William Perry reflected favourably on the military development, the US ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, declared his disapproval. On 10 August, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1009 demanding that Croatia halt military operations, condemning the targeting of UN peacekeepers, and calling for the resumption of talksbut not calling for a HV withdrawal. By 18 August, US diplomats on Robert Frasure's team tasked to mediate in the Bosnian War believed Operation Storm lent their diplomatic mission a chance to succeed, reflecting the opinion of US President Bill Clinton that the Serbs would not negotiate seriously unless they sustained major military defeats.|$|E

5|$|The {{authority}} {{is located at}} Rideau Hall, the official residence of the monarch and the governor general. The governor <b>general,</b> as the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> of the Canadian monarch, is the highest authority in Canadian heraldry. Below the governor general is the Herald Chancellor, a position held {{by the secretary of}} the governor general. The CHA is currently organized in an office called the Chancellery of Honours, the same office that issues Canadian orders and decorations, such as the Order of Canada. The deputy secretary that administers the Chancellery of Honours is also the Deputy Herald Chancellor.|$|R
25|$|The first {{governor}} general's {{flag was}} adopted in 1870 {{and followed the}} design of other viceregal flags in use throughout the British Empire at the time: a Union Flag defaced with the shield of the coat of arms of Canada; though, in contrast to other imperial governors, the wreath surrounding the central badge was one of maple instead of laurel leaves. The design was updated in 1921, to incorporate changes to the appearance of Canada's coat of arms, and again in 1931, to reflect developments in Canada's constitutional structure {{brought about by the}} Statute of Westminster, whereby the governor <b>general</b> became the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> of the monarch of Canada, rather than a representative of the British monarch in Canada, as it was previously.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{was made}} of the [...] "Byng-King Thing" [...] during the {{election}} campaign, which King conducted rhetorically as a campaign for Canadian full sovereignty from Britain, even though it was King who demanded that Byng consult London. King also painted the matter as one relating to democracy, insisting that a governor general has no right to refuse his prime minister's advice, while Meighen denounced King's actions as [...] "a shameless attempt to hang onto power and avoid imminent defeat by the people's elected representatives." [...] However, the Liberals were returned to power with King as prime minister. Once in power, King's government sought at an imperial conference to redefine the role of the governor <b>general</b> as a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> of the sovereign in his Canadian council and not of the British government (the king in his British council). The change was agreed to at the Imperial Conference of 1926 and came to be official {{as a result of the}} Balfour Declaration of 1926 and Statute of Westminster 1931.|$|R

40|$|The {{office of}} <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in the {{administration}} of a deceased’s estate requires a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> who must at the utmost ensure himself to have a solemn understanding of his duties and obligations. The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must act with the highest degree of trustworthiness and good faith in discharging his office. However, in the process of estate administration, one question that has nagged the office of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is that what should be the two distinct capacities of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and trustee since the expression of trustee under the Malaysian Trustee Act 1949 includes the duties incidental to the office of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative.</b> The question is relevant because the role of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is quite distinct from that of a trustee and is subject to different legal framework and liability. Hence, this paper seeks to examine the legal position of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and to identify the line separating the duties of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> from his duties as a trustee. For this purpose, the paper analyses relevant statutory provisions as provided by the Probate and Administration Act 1959 and the Trustee Act 1949. An analysis of the decided cases is also made to identify the distinction between the offices of a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> to that of a trustee {{in the administration}} of the deceased’s estate. The paper concludes that there is no objective test as to when and how a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> becomes a trustee since a person may be a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in respects of certain assets and trustee in respect of others. What matter most is that they must carry out their job diligently and reasonably in which failure to do so will result in their facing legal action by the beneficiary or other interested parties...|$|R
50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> or legal <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> {{is a person}} {{appointed}} by a court to administer the estate of another person. If the estate being administered {{is that of a}} deceased person, the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is either an executor if the deceased person left a will or an administrator of an intestate estate. In other situations, the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> may be a guardian or trustee, or other position. As a fiduciary, a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> has the duties of loyalty, candor or honesty, and good faith. In the United States, punctilio of honor, or the highest standard of honor, is the level of scrupulousness that a fiduciary must abide by.|$|R
25|$|The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must {{understand}} and {{abide by the}} fiduciary duties, such as a duty to keep money in interest bearing account and to treat all beneficiaries equally. Not complying with the fiduciary duties may allow interested persons to petition {{for the removal of}} the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and hold the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> liable for any harm to the estate.|$|R
40|$|A <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is a {{fiduciary}} put {{in charge}} of administering the estate of a deceased’s person. The <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> must at the utmost act with the highest degree of trustworthiness and good faith to ensure that the estate is administered accordingly. As the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> steps into the dead man’s shoes, he is vested with some powers to enable him to manage and preserve the estate. Nevertheless, one question that has nagged the office of <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> is that what should be the extent of his liabilities for any losses resulting from actions taken in the course of exercising his powers. Hence, this paper seeks to examine the powers vested in a <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> and to identify the extent of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative’s</b> liabilities in dealing with the deceased’s estate. For this purpose, the discussion focuses to analyze relevant statutory provisions as provided by the Probate and Administration Act 1959. An analysis of the decided cases is also made to determine the rights of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> in the exercise of his powers and the available remedy to the legal heirs in cases of mismanagement or negligence on part of the <b>personal</b> <b>representative.</b> The paper predicates that as the <b>personal</b> <b>representative</b> holds a fiduciary duty to ensure that the estate is administered accordingly, he needs to conform to the fiduciary duties and standard of conduct, failing which would result in personal liability or legal action instituted against him by the legal heirs or other interested parties...|$|R
