The result was the yellow logo flying down onto a black background before the outline extended out towards the screen, set to a synthesised tune.

25|$|Lindy hop is {{generally}} considered a very <b>dynamic</b> <b>form</b> of dance. Lindy performances may combine choreographed routines, improvised sequences, solo and partner dancing and frequently feature the aerial steps {{for which it is}} perhaps most famous. Contemporary lindy hoppers often recreate or perform historical choreographed routines found in films or taught by 'swing era' dancers such as Frankie Manning. The most well known of these include the Lindy Chorus, the Hellzapoppin routine from the film Hellzapoppin' (1941) and the Big Apple from the film Keep Punching (1939).|$|E

The DLT includes compact <b>form</b> <b>dynamic</b> linearization, partial <b>form</b> <b>dynamic</b> linearization, and full <b>form</b> <b>dynamic</b> linearization. The main feature of the approach is that the controller design depends only on the measured input/output data of the controlled plant.

50|$|Dynamic forms (defined since XFA 2.1 or 2.2) {{can change}} in {{appearance}} in several ways in response {{to changes in the}} data. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>form</b> requires rendering of its content on file opening. Dynamic forms may also be designed to change structure to accommodate changes {{in the structure of the}} data supplied to the form. For example, a page of a form may be omitted if there is no data for it. Another example is a field that may occupy a variable amount of space on the page, resizing itself to efficiently hold its content. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>form</b> cannot rely on a PDF representation of its boilerplate, because the positioning and layout of the boilerplate change as the fields grow and shrink or as subforms are omitted and included.|$|E

40|$|This paper 1 {{discusses}} cepstral feature combinations via linear {{discriminant analysis}} (LDA) {{in the context of}} automatic speaker identification (ASI). Two static cepstral features are considered, namely standard MFCC and a sub-band filtered form derived via linear prediction known as RASTA-PLP. These two are compared along with their first order <b>dynamic</b> <b>forms</b> as both single and combined feature sets. LDA is shown to provide a useful means of combining (dissimilar) feature sets and permitting a direct trade-off between the number of coefficients and ASI performance, particularly when testing under noisy conditions. Also, the importance of pre-normalisation is demonstrated. It is shown {{that in the case of}} individual features, the two static forms give the best performance in clean conditions, with a cross-over to the two <b>dynamic</b> <b>forms</b> being better in the region of SNR= 15 dB. The LDA combination of the two static forms gives the best overall results under both clean and noisy conditions [...] ...|$|R
