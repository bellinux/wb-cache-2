The La Reunion-associated sub-lineage of chikungunya (with a valine substitution in the envelope protein) was shown to increase viral fitness in the secondary vector, Ae. albopictus. Subsequently, a majority of experimental and modeling efforts focused on this combination of a sub-lineage of the East-Central-South African genotype (ECSA-V) – Ae. albopictus, despite the Asian genotype being the etiologic agent of recent chikungunya outbreaks world-wide.

Applying standard dynamic analysis to a modified Susceptible Infected-Recovered (SIR) model that includes an annual variation in the length of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> (EIP), we found that dynamic behavior of the endemic state changes as the influence of the seasonal variation of the EIP becomes stronger.

40|$|The main entomological {{parameters}} {{involved in}} the rate of dengue virus transmission include the longevity of female mosquitoes, the time interval between bites and the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> of the virus. Field and laboratory data provide estimates for these parameters, but their interactions with other factors (e. g. host population density and environmental parameters) make their integration into a transmission model quite complex. To estimate the impact of these parameters on transmission, we developed a model of virus transmission by a vector population which predicts the number of potentially infective bites under a range of temperatures and entomological parameters, including the daily survival rate of females, the interval between bites and the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>period.</b> Results show that in a stable population, an increase in mosquito longevity disproportionately enhances the number of potential transmissions (e. g. by as much as five times when the survival rate rises from 0. 80 to 0. 95). Halving the length of the biting interval with a 10 -degrees C rise in temperature increases the transmission rate by at least 2. 4 times. Accordingly, the model can predict changes in dengue transmission associated with short-term variation in seasonal temperature and also with potentially long-lasting increases in global temperatures...|$|E

It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 1950 - 2015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>periods</b> to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013.

40|$|In 2005, {{established}} {{populations of}} Aedes albopictus (Skuse) {{were discovered in}} the Torres Strait, the region that separates Papua New Guinea from northern Australia. This increased the potential for this species to be introduced to mainland Australia. Because it is an arbovirus vector elsewhere, we undertook laboratory-based infection and transmission experiments to determine the potential for Ae. albopictus from the Torres Strait to become infected with and transmit the four major Australian endemic arboviruses-Murray Valley encephalitis virus, West Nile virus Kunjin strain (WNVKUN), Ross River virus (RRV), and Barmah Forest virus-as well as the exotic Japanese encephalitis virus. Ae. albopictus is susceptible to infection with all viruses, with infection rates ranging between 8 % for WNVKUN and 71 % for RRV. Transmission rates of approximate to 25 % were observed for RRV and Barmah Forest virus, but these were < 17 % for Murray Valley encephalitis virus, WNVKUN, and Japanese encephalitis virus.

40|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} {{between humans and}} mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and causes approximately 96 million cases of disease (dengue fever) each year (Bhatet al. 2013). Symptoms of dengue fever include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and eye, muscle and joint pain (CDC). More sever manifestations such as abdominal pain, bleeding from nose and gums, vomiting of blood, and clammy skin occur in rare cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (CDC). Dengue fever occurs throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide, however, the geographical range and size of epidemics is increasing. Weather and climate are drivers of dengue virus transmission dynamics (Morin et al. 2013) by affecting mosquito proliferation and the virus <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> (i. e. required time for the virus to replicate and disseminate within the mosquito before it can retransmit the virus) ...|$|E
40|$|Population {{size and}} daily {{survival}} rates of disease vectors are important determinants of vectorial capacity. A mark-release-recapture experiment {{was conducted in}} a dengue endemic urban neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to estimate population size, survival rate and vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti females using back-pack aspirators and gravid sticky traps (MosquiTRAP). Estimations of the gravid female population size were different when using data gathered from just the MosquiTRAP (3, 505 individuals) or aspirator (1, 470). However Ae. aegypti survival rates and longevity were similar irrespective of the method of capture. Up to 26. 3 % of released females {{would be able to}} survive for more than 10 days, the length of time of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>period.</b> Vectorial capacity value ranged between 0. 01567 and 0. 4215 and the basic reproductive number (R 0) was estimated to be between 0. 0695 and 1. 88...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} model {{epidemics}} of infectious diseases, particularly to estimate probable {{numbers of cases}} with onset at any particular time, it is necessaiy to incorporate a term for the <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> frequency distribution. Sartwell's hypothesis states that the <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> frequency distribution for infectious disease is generally a log-normal distribution, based on his examination of disease with short <b>incubation</b> <b>periods.</b> However, it may not apply to diseases with long <b>incubation</b> <b>periods.</b> During {{the course of an}} epidemic of a disease with a long <b>incubation</b> <b>period,</b> left and right censoring makes direct observation of the frequency distribution highly unreliable; in addition, time of infection is often unknown. Therefore, for a previously undescribed disease, methods other than direct observation must be employed. One method is to extrapolate from information available for other diseases. In evaluation of Sartwell's hypothesis as applied to diseases with long <b>incubation</b> <b>periods,</b> examination of transfijsion-associated AIDS data was inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|The {{wide range}} in <b>incubation</b> <b>periods</b> among bird species has puzzled {{biologists}} for decades, because an extended egg-phase increases time-dependent mortality of the eggs. We investigated a recently proposed mechanistic explanation inspired by life-history theory, suggesting that adults may increase their own survival by reducing nest attentiveness, {{the percentage of}} daytime spent incubating eggs, in exchange for reduced offspring (egg) survival due to a longer <b>incubation</b> <b>period.</b> <b>Incubation</b> behaviour and egg temperatures (Tegg) of 14 bird species in the humid lowland tropics were studied {{to test the hypothesis}} that lower nest attentiveness and reduced Tegg cause longer <b>incubation</b> <b>periods.</b> Increased nest attentiveness correlated with higher average Tegg. However, neither nest attentiveness nor average Tegg was associated with the length of the <b>incubation</b> <b>period.</b> Longer off-bouts resulted in lower Tegg, but neither number of off-bouts nor off-bout length was associated with <b>incubation</b> <b>period.</b> In addition, we reanalysed a previously published negative association between Tegg and <b>incubation</b> <b>period</b> based on literature data from temperate passerine birds using a larger data set and found no significant correlation. In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that longer <b>incubation</b> <b>periods</b> are caused by reduced nest attentiveness and corresponding lower Tegg...|$|R
25|$|These {{researchers}} {{noticed a}} genetic variation in some kuru patients {{that has been}} known to promote long <b>incubation</b> <b>periods.</b> They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short <b>incubation</b> <b>periods</b> for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This means that there may be many more vCJD patients with longer <b>incubation</b> <b>periods,</b> which may surface many years later.|$|R
