5|$|Stone {{has also}} {{received}} a number of non-performance honors. She was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995 for her contribution to acting. The actress was nominated for Golden Apple Award for being <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with according to her co-stars. In 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France. She received recognition at the 2006 Women Film Critics Circle Awards for her collaborations with AmfAR with their research on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|Radford took {{command of}} the Aviation Training Division in Washington, D.C. on 1 December 1941, seven days before the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II. He was {{appointed}} as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Bureau of Navigation; the double appointment helped to centralize training coordination for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford's office worked long hours {{six days a week}} in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and he later noted that walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with a direct and no-nonsense approach to work, while maintaining a demeanor that made him <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for. He was promoted to captain soon after.|$|E

In 1996, she was nominated for the Golden Apple Award for being <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with according to her co-stars. On May 20, 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France. She received recognition at the 2006 Women Film Critics Circle Awards for her collaborations with AmfAR on their research on AIDS. On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work with HIV/AIDS sufferers. In 2015 Stone was guest of honor at the Pilosio Building Peace Award in Milan. She began an impromptu auction on stage {{in front of a}} crowd of CEOs from the construction industry and other dignitaries, gaining enough pledges to build 28 schools in Africa.|$|E

This definition is elegant and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.|$|E
25|$|If a heavy {{piece of}} pine is {{compared}} with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains {{a larger proportion of}} latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.|$|E

25|$|Many astronomers {{request that}} nearby {{communities}} use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium indium phosphide LED {{as much as}} possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> around or in rare cases filter out. The low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature. In 1980, for example, San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps, whose light is easier for nearby Lick Observatory to filter out. Similar programs are now in place in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E
25|$|The strength, hardness, and {{flexibility}} of copper {{make it very}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with. Copper wiring can be installed simply and easily with no special tools, washers, pigtails, or joint compounds. Its flexibility {{makes it easy to}} join, while its hardness helps keep connections securely in place. It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings. The combination of all of these factors makes it easy for electricians to install copper wire.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Copp and Hayes gently {{explained}} to Chapman that {{he would no longer}} have monopoly use of the DFV and in August 1967 it was announced that the power unit would be available for sale, via Cosworth Engineering, to racing teams throughout the world. Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams big or small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 prices or about £90,000 in 2005 money). The DFV effectively replaced the Coventry Climax as the standard F1 powerplant for the private (mostly British) teams.|$|E

25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber {{is used for}} plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|When Indira came {{to power}} in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US President. At that time, India was reliant on USA for food aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt {{policies}} favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). Relations with US strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favoring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Indira politically and personally. Indira met President Ronald Reagan in 1981 {{for the first time at}} the North–South Summit held to discuss global poverty. Indira had been described to him as an 'Ogre' but he found her charming and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with and they formed a close working relationship during her premiership in 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The type of soils that {{dominate}} the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E

25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with.|$|E
