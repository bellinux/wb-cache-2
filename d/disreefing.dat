40|$|Fluid [...] {{structure}} interaction (FSI) {{modeling of}} spacecraft parachutes involves {{a number of}} computational challenges. The canopy complexity created by the hundreds of gaps and slits and design-related modification of that geometric porosity by removal {{of some of the}} sails and panels are among the formidable challenges. <b>Disreefing</b> from one stage to another when the parachute is used in multiple stages is another formidable challenge. This thesis addresses the computational challenges involved in <b>disreefing</b> of spacecraft parachutes and fully-open and reefed stages of the parachutes with modified geometric porosity. The special techniques developed to address these challenges are described and the FSI computations are be reported. The thesis also addresses the modeling and computation challenges involved in very early stages, where the sudden separation of a cover jettisoned to the spacecraft wake needs to be modeled. Higher-order temporal representations used in modeling the separation motion are described, and the computed separation and wake-induced forces acting on the cover are reported...|$|E
40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the main parachutes, the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on deceleration by drogue parachutes. These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the main parachutes, which have a ringsail construction. The drogue parachutes {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the main parachutes, with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP). Like the main parachutes, the drogue parachutes will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the <b>disreefing</b> involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open drogue parachutes. Orion spacecraft drogue parachutes will have three stages, with FSI modeling of <b>disreefing</b> from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than <b>disreefing</b> from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion drogue parachutes includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|E

Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and fluid–-structure interaction (FSI) modeling during the <b>disreefing</b> involve computational challenges beyond those we have in FSI modeling of fully-open spacecraft parachutes. These additional challenges are created by the increased geometric complexities and by the rapid changes in the parachute geometry. The computational challenges are further increased because of the added geometric porosity of the latest design, where the "windows" created by the removal of panels and the wider gaps created by the removal of sails compound the geometric and flow complexity. Orion spacecraft main parachutes will have three stages, with computation of the Stage 1 shape and FSI modeling of <b>disreefing</b> from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being the most challenging. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out.

40|$|An {{air drop}} test program was {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the development of a decelerator subsystem for recovering the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. This development test program consisted of six drops performed over the period from June 1977 to September 1978 at a parachute test center in California. The testing concerned a 48, 000 -lb drop test vehicle released from the B- 52 mothership. The drop test program is described and pertinent test results are discussed. Data include snatch loads, inflation characteristics, peak inflation and <b>disreef</b> loads, and drag performance. Performance characteristics of the drogue parachute and the main parachute are established...|$|R
40|$|A reefed B. 2 -meter nominal-diameter (40 -ft) disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA Supersonic High Altitude Parachute Experiment (SHAPE) program. A three-stage rocket {{was used}} to drive an instrumented test payload to an altitude of 43. 6 km (143 000 ft) and a Mach number of 2. 58 where the parachute was deployed by means of a mortar. After a time delay of about 8. 5 seconds, the parachute was <b>disreefed</b> at a Mach number of 0. 99. The report contains an analysis of parachute inflation, drag, and stability for both the reefed and unreefed parts of the test. In addition, detailed descriptions of the test parachute, the reefing system, and the parachute packing procedurea are included. Prepared at Langley Research Center. N 71 - 34026.

40|$|Reefing {{lines are}} an {{essential}} feature to manage inflation loads. During each Engineering Development Unit (EDU) {{test of the}} Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS), a chase aircraft is staged to be level with the cluster of Main ringsail parachutes during the initial inflation and reefed stages. This allows for capturing high-quality still photographs of the reefed skirt, suspension line, and canopy geometry. The over-inflation angles are synchronized with measured loads data in order to compute the tension force in the reefing line. The traditional reefing tension equation assumes radial symmetry, but cluster effects cause the reefed skirt of each parachute to elongate to a more elliptical shape. This effect was considered in evaluating multiple parachutes to estimate the semi-major and semi-minor axes. Three flight tests are assessed, including one with a skipped first stage, which had peak reefing line tension over three {{times higher than the}} nominal parachute <b>disreef</b> sequence...|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests have}} been made in the Langley {{transonic}} dynamics tunnel on a 0. 25 -scale model of Sandia Laboratories' 3. 96 -meter (13 -foot), slanted ribbon design, lifting parachute. The lifting parachute is the first stage of a proposed two-stage payload delivery system. The lifting parachute model was attached to a forebody representing the payload. The forebody was designed and installed in the test section in a manner which allowed rotational freedom about the pitch and yaw axes. Values of parachute axial force coefficient, rolling moment coefficient, and payload trim angles in pitch and yaw are presented through the transonic speed range. Data are presented for the parachute in both the reefed and full open conditions. Time history records of lifting parachute deployment and <b>disreefing</b> tests are included...|$|E
40|$|Inflation, drag, and {{stability}} characteristics of an 85. 3 -foot (26 -meter) nominal diameter ringsail parachute deployed at a Mach number of 1. 15 and {{at an altitude}} of 132, 600 feet (40. 42 kilometers) were obtained from the first flight test of the Planetary Entry Parachute Program. After deployment, the parachute inflated to the reefed condition. However, the canopy was unstable and produced low drag in the reefed condition. Upon <b>disreefing</b> and opening to full inflation, a slight instability in the canopy mouth was observed initially. After a short time, the fluctuations diminished and a stable configuration was attained. Results indicate a loss in drag during the fluctuation period prior to stable inflation. During descent, stability characteristics of the system were such that the average pitch-yaw angle from the local vertical was less than 10 degrees. Rolling motion between the payload and parachute canopy quickly damped to small amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} reconstructing {{inflation}} loads of Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) has been updated {{as the program}} transitioned to testing Engineering Development Unit (EDU) hardware. The equations used to reduce the test data have been re-derived {{based on the same}} physical assumptions made by simulations. Due to instrumentation challenges, individual parachute loads are determined from complementary accelerometer and load cell measurements. Cluster inflations are now simulated by modeling each parachute individually to better represent different inflation times and non-synchronous <b>disreefing.</b> The reconstruction procedure is tailored to either infinite mass or finite mass events based on measurable characteristics from the test data. Inflation parameters are determined from an automated optimization routine to reduce subjectivity. Infinite mass inflation parameters have been re-defined to avoid unrealistic interactions in Monte Carlo simulations. Sample cases demonstrate how best-fit inflation parameters are used to generate simulated drag areas and loads which favorably agree with test data...|$|E
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue <b>disreefs</b> twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|R
40|$|A {{parachute}} simulation environment (PSE) {{has been}} developed that aims {{to take advantage of}} legacy parachute simulation codes and modern object-oriented programming techniques. This hybrid simulation environment provides the parachute analyst with a natural and intuitive way to construct simulation tasks while preserving the pedigree and authority of established parachute simulations. NASA currently employs four simulation tools for developing and analyzing air-drop tests performed by the CEV Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) Project. These tools were developed at different times, in different languages, and with different capabilities in mind. As a result, each tool has a distinct interface and set of inputs and outputs. However, regardless of the simulation code that is most appropriate for the type of test, engineers typically perform similar tasks for each drop test such as prediction of loads, assessment of altitude, and sequencing of <b>disreefs</b> or cut-aways. An object-oriented approach to simulation configuration allows the analyst to choose models of real physical test articles (parachutes, vehicles, etc.) and sequence them to achieve the desired test conditions. Once configured, these objects are translated into traditional input lists and processed by the legacy simulation codes. This approach minimizes the number of sim inputs that the engineer must track while configuring an input file. An object oriented approach to simulation output allows a common set of post-processing functions to perform routine tasks such as plotting and timeline generation with minimal sensitivity to the simulation that generated the data. Flight test data may also be translated into the common output class to simplify test reconstruction and analysis...|$|R
40|$|A reefed 12. 2 -meter nominal-diameter (40 -ft) disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA Supersonic High Altitude Parachute Experiment (SHAPE) program. A three-stage rocket {{was used}} to drive the instrumented payload to an altitude of 43. 6 km (143, 000 ft), a Mach number of 2. 58, and a dynamic pressure of 972 N/m(exp 2) (20. 3 lb/ft(exp 2)) where the parachute was deployed by means of a mortar. The parachute deployed satisfactorily and reached a partially inflated condition characterized by irregular variations in parachute projected area. A full, stable reefed inflation was achieved when the system had decelerated to a Mach number of about 1. 5. The steady, reefed projected area was 49 percent of the steady, unreefed area and the average drag coefficient was 0. 30. <b>Disreefing</b> occurred at a Mach number of 0. 99 and a dynamic pressure of 81 N/m(exp 2) (1. 7 lb/ft(exp 2)). The parachute maintained a steady inflated shape {{for the remainder of the}} deceleration portion of the flight and throughout descent. During descent, the average effective drag coefficient was 0. 57. There was little, if any, coning motion, and the amplitude of planar oscillations was generally less than 10 degrees.
