The directors continuously <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted {{if he does not}} go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E

Hines-Archstone officials said they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to twice as many investors as usual before financing could be found. The lack of financing began to worry contractors. Firms such as the structural engineering company Thornton Tomasetti, consulting engineering firm TOLK, Inc., and Shalom Baranes Associates, among others, {{said they would be}} forced to lay off employees if the project did not start soon.|$|E

500|$|Paul Simon's {{homage to}} Lennon, [...] "The Late Great Johnny Ace", {{initially}} sings of the {{rhythm and blues}} singer Johnny Ace, {{who is said to}} have shot himself in 1954, then goes on to reference John Lennon, as well as President John F. Kennedy who was assassinated in 1963, the year [...] "Beatlemania" [...] started. Simon had actually premiered the song during Simon & Garfunkel's reunion Concert in Central Park in 1981; {{near the end of the}} song, a fan ran onto the stage, possibly in response to Simon's mentioning Lennon in the lyrics. The man, saying to Simon, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you", was dragged offstage by Simon's personnel; all of this can be seen in the DVD of the concert. The song also appears on Simon's Hearts and Bones (1983) album.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended 4 to help change that status, commenting, [...] "Figuring {{out a way to}} get R back on the radio is challenging... With 4, I tried to mix R from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." [...] On her website she wrote, [...] "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60." [...] Beyoncé also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs.|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

500|$|Stuttgart manager Joachim Löw was {{disappointed}} with the defeat, but remained confident about his future at the team, {{as well as the}} season: [...] "I'm calmly looking forward to the discussion. The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also taking time to defend Löw: [...] "We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them, {{it does not mean that}} it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally. We could have done better this season. We carelessly squandered about eight games". Yakin agreed and offered his own comments: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about many things, you cannot work together in the way it was this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pictures}} {{shown on}} the world feed (supplied by host broadcaster RAI) of Senna being treated were considered by the BBC (the corporation responsible for broadcasting the San Marino Grand Prix to viewers in the United Kingdom) to be too graphic, disturbing and upsetting for general viewing at the time (around 13:20 GMT), and the BBC abandoned RAI's world feed to focus on their own camera in the pit lane. BBC commentator Murray Walker has frequently talked about how upsetting it was to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to viewers whilst attempting to avoid any and all mention of the distressing images shown on RAI. Referring {{to the number of}} times the incident was replayed on the world feed, Ferrari team principal Jean Todt stated that [...] "even if you didn't want to watch it, you could barely fail to". Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams, and after approximately fifteen minutes of on-site medical attention, was airlifted directly to Maggiore Hospital, becoming the third and final driver to be admitted there during the weekend. Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight. Thirty-seven minutes after the crash, at 2:55pm local time, the race was restarted.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

"since the Six-Day War, Israeli {{politicians}} have repeatedly established {{a connection between}} European anti-Semitism {{and the fact that}} the Palestinians don't accept the founding of the State of Israel.

2500|$|As {{an unknown}} {{stand-up}} comedian out of college, she struggled {{for many years}} before finding her comic style. She did stints in the Catskills and found that she disliked the older style of comedy at the time, such as Phyllis Diller's, who she felt was a pioneer female comedian. Her breakthrough came at The Second City in Chicago in 1961, where she was dubbed [...] "the best girl since Elaine May," [...] who also got her start there. But May became her and fellow comedian Treva Silverman's role model, as Rivers saw her as [...] "an assertive woman with a marvelous, fast mind and, at the same time, pretty and feminine." [...] It was also there that she learned [...] "self reliance," [...] she said, [...] "that I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> down in my humor" [...] and could still earn an income by making intelligent people laugh. [...] "I was really born as a comedian at Second City. I owe it my career." ...|$|E

He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E

Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room.
