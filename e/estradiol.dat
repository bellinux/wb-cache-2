5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, <b>estradiol</b> suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of <b>estradiol</b> reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to <b>estradiol</b> {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: estrogen receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and estrogen receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of <b>estradiol</b> can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and <b>estradiol</b> deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone <b>estradiol</b> may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, Î²-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, <b>estradiol</b> increase, leading to breast growth in {{preparation}} for lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of <b>estradiol,</b> and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in <b>estradiol</b> levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, <b>estradiol</b> or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and <b>estradiol</b> for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is {{additionally}} esterified into lipoidal <b>estradiol</b> forms like <b>estradiol</b> palmitate and <b>estradiol</b> stearate to {{a certain}} extent; these esters are stored in adipose tissue and may act as a very long-lasting reservoir of <b>estradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol,</b> estrone, and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically. Estetrol is currently under development for medical indications, but {{has not yet been}} approved in any country. A variety of synthetic estrogen esters, such as <b>estradiol</b> valerate, <b>estradiol</b> cypionate, <b>estradiol</b> acetate, <b>estradiol</b> undecylate, polyestradiol phosphate, and <b>estradiol</b> benzoate, are used clinically. The aforementioned compounds behave as prodrugs to <b>estradiol,</b> and are longer-lasting in comparison. Esters of estrone and estriol also exist and are employed in clinical medicine.|$|E
25|$|Inactivation of <b>estradiol</b> {{includes}} {{conversion to}} less-active estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Estriol {{is the major}} urinary metabolite. <b>Estradiol</b> is conjugated in the liver to form estrogen conjugates like <b>estradiol</b> sulfate, <b>estradiol</b> glucuronide and, as such, excreted via the kidneys. Some of the water-soluble conjugates are excreted via the bile duct, and partly reabsorbed after hydrolysis from the intestinal tract. This enterohepatic circulation contributes to maintaining <b>estradiol</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of the {{conversion}} of <b>estradiol</b> to estrone, resulting {{in an increase in}} the ratio of circulating <b>estradiol</b> to estrone. <b>Estradiol</b> is far more potent than estrone as an estrogen, which is comparatively almost inactive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is not {{produced}} in the gonads only, in particular, fat cells produce active precursors to <b>estradiol,</b> {{and will continue to}} do so even after menopause. <b>Estradiol</b> is also {{produced in the}} brain and in arterial walls.|$|E
25|$|In the female, <b>estradiol</b> acts as {{a growth}} hormone for tissue of the {{reproductive}} organs, supporting {{the lining of the}} vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. <b>Estradiol</b> appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, <b>estradiol</b> produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, <b>estradiol,</b> in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, <b>estradiol</b> increases due to placental production. The effect of <b>estradiol,</b> together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting <b>estradiol</b> has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of <b>estradiol</b> are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized <b>estradiol</b> benzoate from <b>estradiol</b> in 1933, and <b>estradiol</b> benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance <b>estradiol</b> valerate and <b>estradiol</b> cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from <b>estradiol</b> by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. It remains widely used in combined oral contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Micronized <b>estradiol,</b> via {{the oral}} route, was first {{evaluated}} in 1972, {{and this was}} followed by the evaluation of vaginal and intranasal micronized <b>estradiol</b> in 1977. Oral micronized <b>estradiol</b> was first approved in the United States under the brand name Estrace in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormone that}} dominates female {{development}} is an estrogen called <b>estradiol.</b> While <b>estradiol</b> promotes {{growth of the}} breasts and uterus, {{it is also the}} principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal maturation and closure. <b>Estradiol</b> levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to <b>estradiol.</b> <b>Estradiol</b> mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. <b>Estradiol</b> also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild gynecomastia or even developing swellings under nipples during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of <b>estradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Enhancement of {{the rate}} of {{peripheral}} conversion of testosterone into <b>estradiol,</b> thus decreasing the ratio of circulating testosterone to <b>estradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is a {{steroid hormone}} {{produced}} by aromatization of testosterone. <b>Estradiol</b> {{is the principal}} human estrogen and acts on estrogen receptors throughout the body. The largest amounts of <b>estradiol</b> are produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries, but lesser amounts are derived from testicular and adrenal testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 95% of orally {{ingested}} <b>estradiol</b> is inactivated during first-pass metabolism. Nonetheless, {{levels of}} <b>estradiol</b> {{in the liver}} with oral administration are supraphysiological and approximately 4- to 5-fold higher than in circulation due to the first-pass. This does not occur with parenteral <b>estradiol.</b> In contrast to <b>estradiol,</b> ethinylestradiol is much more resistant to hepatic metabolism, with a mean oral bioavailability of approximately 45%, and has a similar impact on hepatic protein synthesis with both oral and transdermal routes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> acts {{primarily}} as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid hormone receptor. There are two subtypes of the ER, ERÎ± and ERÎ², and <b>estradiol</b> potently binds to and activates {{both of these}} receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which <b>estradiol</b> mediates its biological effects in the body. <b>Estradiol</b> also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for <b>estradiol,</b> via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike {{the case of the}} ER, GPER appears to be selective for <b>estradiol,</b> and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.|$|E
25|$|During the {{reproductive}} years, most <b>estradiol</b> in women {{is produced by}} the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of Î4-androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to <b>estradiol</b> by 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Smaller amounts of <b>estradiol</b> are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is {{produced}} especially within the follicles {{of the female}} ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). <b>Estradiol</b> is biosynthesized from cholesterol {{through a series of}} chemical intermediates. One principal pathway involves the generation of androstenedione, which is converted into estrone by aromatase and then by 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into <b>estradiol.</b> Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, an androgen and the primary male sex hormone, which in turn can be aromatized into <b>estradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol,</b> {{like other}} steroids, {{is derived from}} cholesterol. After side chain {{cleavage}} and using the Î5 or the Î4- pathway, Î4-androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the Î4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to <b>estradiol</b> by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, Î4-androstenedione is aromatized to estrone, which is subsequently converted to <b>estradiol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The optimal ranges for {{estrogen}} {{apply only}} to individuals taking <b>estradiol</b> (or an ester of <b>estradiol),</b> and not to those taking synthetic or other non-bioidentical preparations (e.g., CEEs or ethinylestradiol).|$|E
25|$|In girls, <b>estradiol</b> (the primary female sex hormone) causes {{thickening}} of {{lips and}} oral mucosa {{as well as}} further development of the vulva. In the vulva and vagina, <b>estradiol</b> causes thickening (stratification) of the skin {{and the growth of}} both the myoepithelial layer and the smooth muscle of the vagina. Typically <b>estradiol</b> will also cause pronounced growth of the labia minora and to a lesser degree of the labia majora.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> has complex {{effects on}} the liver. It affects the {{production}} of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting. In high amounts, <b>estradiol</b> can lead to cholestasis, for instance cholestasis of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include <b>estradiol</b> (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and <b>estradiol</b> esters such as <b>estradiol</b> valerate and <b>estradiol</b> cypionate (which are prodrugs of <b>estradiol).</b> Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as Premarin, and ethinylestradiol are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or by an implant.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, <b>estradiol.</b> These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining <b>estradiol</b> support after menopause. Thus, <b>estradiol</b> produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, <b>estradiol</b> induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is also {{responsible}} for the increased production of pheomelanin, resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, labia minora and sometimes labia majora. <b>Estradiol</b> together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the areola.|$|E
25|$|In women, serum <b>estradiol</b> is {{measured}} in a clinical laboratory and reflects primarily {{the activity of the}} ovaries. As such, they are useful in the detection of baseline estrogen in women with amenorrhea or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors will demonstrate persistent high levels of <b>estradiol</b> and other estrogens. In precocious puberty, <b>estradiol</b> levels are inappropriately increased.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{activated}} sludge plant performance found estrogen removal rates varied considerably but averaged 78% for estrone, 91% for <b>estradiol,</b> and 76% for ethinylestradiol (estriol effluent concentrations are between those of estrone and <b>estradiol,</b> but estriol is a much less potent endocrine disruptor to fish).|$|E
25|$|<b>Estradiol</b> is {{reported}} to be approximately 12times as potent as estrone and 80times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic activity. As such, <b>estradiol</b> is the main estrogen in the body, although the roles of estrone and estriol as estrogens are said to not be negligible.|$|E
25|$|Aromatase {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in regions {{involved in the}} regulation of aggressive behavior, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus. In studies using genetic knock-out techniques in inbred mice, male mice that lacked a functional aromatase enzyme displayed a marked reduction in aggression. Long-term treatment with <b>estradiol</b> partially restored aggressive behavior, suggesting that the neural conversion of circulating testosterone to <b>estradiol</b> {{and its effect on}} estrogen receptors influences inter-male aggression. In addition, two different estrogen receptors, ERa and ERb, have been identified as having the ability to exert different effects on aggression in mice. However, the effect of <b>estradiol</b> appears to vary depending on the strain of mouse, and in some strains it reduces aggression during long days (16 h of light), while during short days (8 h of light) <b>estradiol</b> rapidly increases aggression.|$|E
