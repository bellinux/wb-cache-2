40|$|The {{evolution}} of wide shear zones (or shear bands) was investigated experimentally and numerically for quasistatic dry granular flows in split bottom shear cells. We compare {{the behavior of}} materials consisting of beads, <b>irregular</b> <b>grains</b> (e. g. sand) and elongated particles. Shearing an initially random sample, the zone width was found to significantly decrease {{in the first stage}} of the process. The characteristic shear strain associated with this decrease is about unity and it is systematically increasing with shape anisotropy, i. e. when the grain shape changes from spherical to irregular (e. g. sand) and becomes elongated (pegs). The strongly decreasing tendency of the zone width is followed by a slight increase which is more pronounced for rod like particles than for grains with smaller shape anisotropy (beads or irregular particles). The {{evolution of}} the zone width is connected to shear induced density change and for nonspherical particles it also involves grain reorientation effects.

Hypocycloid motions occur both inside and outside the glass ring which confines the grain. Epicycloid motion only appears outside the glass ring. Cuspate cycloid motions, circle motion, and stationary grain are also observed. All these motions are related with both the initial conditions of dropped grain and the discharge parameters. The Magnus force originated from the spin of the <b>irregular</b> <b>grain</b> is confirmed by comparison experiments with regular microspheres, and it plays important role on these (cuspate) cycloid motions. The observed complex motions are explained in term of force analysis and numerical simulations.

Even for <b>irregular</b> <b>grains</b> that behave like cohesive powders, the granular material displayed a different behavior in reduced gravity and microgravity. This means that the behavior of granular material at the g-levels present on the surface of small asteroids (10 − 4 g and below) cannot be extrapolated from its behavior at lunar g-level (∼ 10 − 2 g).

30|$|Dust {{aggregation}} experiments by Blum et al. (2006) using irregularly shaped SiO 2 grains {{resulted in}} aggregates {{with a high}} porosity (0.93). Dust samples consisting of these polydisperse, <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains</b> showed a range of tensile strengths, peaking at ~ 250 N/m 2, while the tensile strength of samples of quasi-monodisperse, <b>irregular</b> diamond <b>grains</b> peaked at ~ 200 N/m 2 (Blum et al., 2006). Both of these samples were described as “slightly compressed,” with porosities of 0.83 for the SiO 2 grains and 0.78 for the diamond grains. The tensile strength increased significantly with the degree of compression of the material, rising to 2300 N/m 2 for the <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains</b> compressed to a porosity of 0.56 (Blum et al., 2006), so uncompressed samples of these materials {{are likely to have}} tensile strengths somewhat lower. The uncompressed porosity for the <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains</b> was 0.93 (Blum et al., 2006), significantly higher than the 0.83 and the 0.56 for the samples on which the tensile strength was determined. To infer the tensile strength of the uncompressed material formed in Blum et al.’s (2006) experiments, we performed a linear extrapolation of the pair of data points they reported for the <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains.</b> But this approach gave a negative value of the tensile strength for uncompressed, <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains</b> (i.e., porosity = 0.93), demonstrating that a linear fit is not appropriate but indicating that the uncompressed material has a tensile strength substantially lower than 250 N/m 2. A second degree polynomial fit, which requires a third point, was performed including as the third point zero tensile strength at a porosity of 1. This second degree polynomial fit gives a tensile strength at a porosity of 0.93, the value for the natural, uncompressed <b>irregular</b> SiO 2 <b>grains</b> formed in Blum et al.’s (2006) experiments, of ~ 50 N/m 2. This porosity is comparable to that of the most porous interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), extraterrestrial dust collected intact from the Earth’s stratosphere (Flynn and Sutton, 1991).|$|R

The nucleation rate is chosen as site saturated. Temporal evolution of the simulated microstructures is analyzed to provide the time dependence of the recrystallized volume fraction and grain sizes. The recrystallized volume fraction shows sigmoidal variations with time.

In some cases it also occurs within troilite, within metallic Fe-Ni, or at the boundaries these phases form with silicates or chromite. Ordinary chondrites that contain a relatively large number of occurrences of metallic Cu/sq mm have a tendency to have experienced {{moderately high}} degrees of shock. Shock processes can cause local melting and transportation of metallic Fe-Ni and troilte; because metallic Cu is mainly associated with these phases, it also gets redistributed during shock events.

This particular composition is on a phase boundary between titanium-rich tetragonally structured PZT and the zirconium-rich rhombohedral phase. The coexistence and relative instability of these phases {{is thought to be}} one of the origins of high piezoelectric coefficients exhibited by films of this composition. The aims of this study were to investigate variables affecting the piezoelectric coefficients in sol-gel deposited PZT 52 / 48 thin films. Control of preferred orientation if PZT 52 / 48 films on platinum-coated substrates was accomplished by manipulating processing conditions, specifically pyrolysis temperature. Corona poling was investigated as an alternative to contact poling. Attempts were made to find a set of poling parameters which yielded consistent results. Piezoelectric coefficients are highly dependant on poling conditions, with coefficient being lower in insufficiently poled films or those damaged by field induced sample cracking. It was observed that (001) /(100) -oriented samples with small grains had significantly lower piezoelectric coefficients and were harder to pole than coarser-grained (00 l) /(l 00) - oriented samples. Samples with a more <b>irregular</b> <b>grain</b> structure and a wide distribution of grain size had the lowest piezoelectric coefficients, irrespective of preferred orientation. The impact of grain size on piezoelectric coefficients was confirmed using the FWHM of the (200) reaction. Films with more <b>irregular</b> <b>grain</b> structures had higher FWHM than those with more uniform grains and had lower d 33,f and e 31,f. Values of e 31,f and d 33 f were plotted against (001) intensity a determined from xray diffraction. It was difficult to determine any correlation between piezoelectric coefficients and (001) intensity. I comparison, there was a definite inverse correlation between d 33,f, e 31,f and FWHM, indicating that defect concentration has much more of an impact on piezoelectric coefficients in polycrystalline thin films than (001) intensity as a result of defect-induced domain pinning...|$|E

40|$|Irregular dust grains {{are subject}} to {{radiative}} torques when irradiated by interstellar starlight. It is shown how these radiative torques may be calculated using the discrete dipole approximation. Calculations are carried out for one <b>irregular</b> <b>grain</b> geometry, and three different grain sizes. It is shown that radiative torques {{can play an important}} dynamical role in spinup of interstellar dust grains, resulting in rotation rates which may exceed even those expected from H 2 formation on the grain surface. Because the radiative torque on an interstellar grain is determined by the overall grain geometry rather than merely the condition of the grain surface, the resulting superthermal rotation is expected to be quite long-lived. By itself, long-lived superthermal rotation would permit grain alignment by normal paramagnetic dissipation on the "Davis-Greenstein" timescale ø DG.

Recent work by Lazarian & Hoang showed that mechanical torques might {{play a significant role in}} aligning helical grains along the interstellar magnetic field direction, even in the case of subsonic drift. We compute the mechanical torques on 13 different <b>irregular</b> <b>grains</b> and examine their resulting rotational dynamics, assuming steady rotation about the principal axis of greatest moment of inertia. We find that the alignment efficiency in the subsonic drift regime depends sensitively on the grain shape, with more efficient alignment for shapes with a substantial mechanical torque even in the case of no drift. The alignment is typically more efficient for supersonic drift. A more rigorous analysis of the dynamics is required to definitively appraise the role of mechanical torques in grain alignment.
