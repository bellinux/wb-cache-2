The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place {{in front of the}} judges and a live studio audience during May and June. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys (male soloists aged 14 to 24), Under 25 Girls (female soloists aged 14 to 24), Over 25s (soloists aged 25 and over) and Groups. Each judge was given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts after day two, and their six acts after day three. Special guest judges, including Wynter Gordon, Stephen Belafonte, Darren Hayes and The Veronicas, were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp was the <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges including Beyoncé, Melanie C, Jason Derulo, Good Charlotte and Leona Lewis.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Home</b> <b>visit</b> {{can be an}} {{intervention}} tool in family’s health and in the continuity of postpartum cares. Objective: Examine the impact of nursing <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> in puerperium and in neonates of occidental countries. Methods: The language used was English and the publication period refers to the last 10 years. Expression used in Web of Knowledge ISI database: ((postpartum periodORpuerper*) AND((Home visit*). Results: From 137 articles, 6 articles were eligible, after {{the implementation of the}} protocol of systematic reviews of literature. Three dimensions related to <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> were identified: personal contact; relation cost-benefit/efficacy; importance of <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> to the mothers. According to Salonen et al (2011), online resources with information about puerperium is not effective. Paul et al (2004), Koc et al (2008) and Ammerman et al (2013) demonstrate that <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> reduces parental stress and neonates’ trauma, decreasing rates of hospital readmission. Rodrigues et al (2006) and Aksu et al (2011) show the lower cost of <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> compared to the cost of neonates’ readmission. Mothers who receive <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> choose exclusive breastfeeding, for a longer period, recognizing the importance of <b>home</b> <b>visit.</b> Conclusions: <b>Home</b> <b>visit</b> reduces parental stress, contributes to knowledge acquisition, and reduces neonates’ readmission and morbidity. The interpersonal relationship shows more effectiveness in prevention of postpartum problems unlike online information. Furthermore, relation cost-benefit is positive, because <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> costs are lower than costs of neonates’ readmission.

Methods: Twenty-eight participants (mean age, 78. 6 ± 7. 5 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 13) or control (n = 15) group for 3 months. The intervention group received a 60 -minute FIT <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> program; the control group received a 30 -minute <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> using common conversational techniques.

25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E
