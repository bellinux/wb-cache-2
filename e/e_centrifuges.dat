40|$|Centrifuge {{experiments}} modeling single-phase flow in prototype porous media typically use {{the same}} porous medium and permeant. Then, well-known scaling laws are used to transfer the results to the prototype. More general scaling laws that relax these restrictions are presented. For permeants that are immiscible with an accompanying gas phase, model-prototype (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>centrifuge</b> model experiment–target system) scaling is demonstrated. Scaling is shown to be feasible for Miller-similar (or geometrically similar) media. Scalings are presented for a more general class, Lisle-similar media, based on the equivalence mapping of Richards' equation onto itself. Whereas model-prototype scaling of Miller-similar media can be realized easily for arbitrary boundary conditions, Lisle-similarity in a finite length medium generally, but not always, involves a mapping to a moving boundary problem. An exception occurs for redistribution in Lisle- similar porous media, which is shown to map to spatially fixed boundary conditions. Complete model-prototype scalings for this example are derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} in dewaterability {{of waste}} activated sludge (WAS) by oxidative treatment using thermally- and alkali-activated persulfates (i. e., peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS)) was studied with two indices representing dewaterability change, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>centrifuged</b> weight reduction (CWR) and standardized-capillary suction time (SCST). The tested conditions include 50  °C/PMS, 50  °C/PDS, 80  °C/PMS, and 80  °C/PDS as thermally-activated persulfate systems and NaOH/PMS, NaOH/PDS, KOH/PMS, and KOH/PDS as alkali-activated persulfate systems. The oxidation by activated persulfates caused the disintegration of bacterial cells and extracelluar polymeric substance (EPS) of WAS, affecting the sludge dewaterability. The highest dewaterability was found at the KOH/PDS treatment in CWR and at the 80  °C/PDS treatment in SCST. The EPSs were stratified as soluble, loosely-bound (LB) and tightly-bound (TB) fractions, and contents of protein and polysaccharide in each fraction were measured to characterize the EPS matrix before and after treatments. The statistical analysis {{of the relationship between}} EPS character and dewaterability indicated that the protein content in LB-EPS was the dominant negative factor for the dewaterability represented by SCST, whereas the polysaccharide content in soluble-EPS was identified as the dominant positive factor for the dewaterability by CWR...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of {{cone penetration test}} (CPT) data {{is important for the}} in-situ characterisation of soils. Interpretation of CPT data remains a predominately empirical process {{due to the lack of}} a rigorous model that can relate soil properties to penetrometer readings. Interpretation is especially difficult in layered soils, where penetrometer response can be affected by several horizons of soil with different properties. This paper aims to provide some insight into the mechanisms of soil displacement that occur as a penetrometer is pushed into layered soils. Data is presented from centrifuge modelling of probe penetration in layered soils in an axisymmetric container where soil deformation patterns around the probe can be measured. Results obtained from uniform soil tests are also presented to illustrate the effects of soil density and stress level (i. <b>e.</b> <b>centrifuge</b> acceleration). A large influence zone is found to relate to the higher penetration resistance obtained in a denser soil. Differing soil displacement patterns at low and high stresses are related to the tendency of the soil to dilate, with the well-known consequence of a non-linear increase of penetration resistance with stress level. Layered soil tests show a clear difference of soil deformation patterns compared to uniform tests, especially for vertical displacements. The peak value of vertical displacement of the soil occurs at dense-over-loose interfaces, while a local minimum occurs at loose-over-dense interfaces. Parameters are proposed to quantitatively evaluate the layered effects on soil deformations and a deformation mechanism is described for penetration in layered soils based on the transition of displacement profiles...|$|R

Consider an experiment to screen factors that may influence the blood glucose readings of a clinical laboratory testing device.

The nine factors (Wu and Hamada 2000, Table 7. 3) are (A) wash (no or yes), (B) microvial volume (2. 0, 2. 5, or 3. 0 ml), (C) caras H 2 O level (20, 28, or 35 ml), (D) centrifuge RPM (2100, 2300, 2500), (<b>E)</b> <b>centrifuge</b> time (1. 75, 3, 4. 5 min), (F) sensitivity (0. 10, 0. 25, 0. 50), (G) temperature (25, 30, 37 C), (H) dilution ratio (1 : 51, 1 : 101, 1 : 151), and (I) absorption (2. 5, 2, 1. 5). To ensure that all the main e#ects are estimated clearly from each other, it is desirable to use an orthogonal array (OA). The smallest OA found for one two-level factor and eight three-level factors requires 36 runs. However, the scientist wants to reduce the cost of this experiment and plans to use an 18 -run design. A good solution then is to use an 18 -run nearly orthogonal array (NOA). The concept of OA dates back to Rao (1947). OAs have been used widely in manufacturing and high-technology industries for quality and productivity improvement experiments as evidenced by many industrial case studies and recent design textbooks (Myers and Montgomery 1995; Wu and Hamada 2000). Applications of NOAs can be found in Wang and Wu (1992), Nguyen (1996 b) and the references therein.

40|$|Noble metal {{nanomaterials}} have numerous uses in plasmonic {{and surface}} enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection applications; however, upon {{the addition of}} analytes, nanomaterials often undergo uncontrolled aggregation which leads to inconsistent signal intensities. To overcome this limitation, the effect of gold nanosphere concentration, column purification, and surface chemistry functionalization using internally etched silica stabilization methods was investigated on SERS assays for small molecule detection. Nanostructure composition, size, shape, stability, surface chemistry, optical properties, and SERS-activity were monitored using localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR or extinction) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. First, the behavior of citrate-stabilized gold nanospheres was monitored {{as a function of}} molecular surface coverage. Both extinction and SERS spectral intensities increased linearly below monolayer functionalization. Above this value, however, uncontrolled nanoparticle aggregation occurred and large but irreproducible SERS signal intensities were monitored. Next, gold nanoparticles were encapsulated with varying silica shell thicknesses and purified using traditional centrifugation steps and/or column chromatography. Relative to the traditionally purified (i. <b>e.</b> <b>centrifuged)</b> samples, the SERS responses from small molecules using the column purified nanoparticle samples followed a well-known SERS distance-dependence model. Thus, surface chemistry cannot form more than a 2 nm thick layer on gold nanospheres if SERS applications were targeted. To overcome these challenges, gold nanospheres encapsulated with a thick silica shell were made SERS-active by etching the internal silica layer near the metal surface. During the synthesis of these internally etched silica-coated gold nanospheres, the LSPR wavelength shift, a parameter related to the effective local refractive index near the gold core, was monitored instead of etching time, in order to produce nanostructures with more uniform internal silica etching from sample to sample. The SERS-activity of a target molecule using these nanostructures was measured as a function of LSPR wavelength shift. SERS signal intensity increased, which suggested that more analyte molecules were able to bind to the gold surface because of the larger pore size in the silica layer near the metal core. Further exploration of these findings should increase the integration of solution-phase nanoparticles in more predictable functions in future applications, resulting in more quantitative and reproducible molecular detection in complex sample matrices, including biological and environmental samples...|$|R

By the mid 1990 s, several methods were proposed to enhance wound healing of surgical sites by introducing high concentrations of human platelets to these areas. In the early 21 st century, Choukroun et al (2006 b) introduced {{a new type of}} platelet concentrate that was devoid of any additives, and required no specialised equipment for its production. This concentrate was termed Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and although various aspects of this biomaterial had been studied, very little is currently known about its storage properties. Aim: To determine whether storage time had a significant effect on the platelet concentration of Choukroun’s PRF Method: A total of 30 patients were enrolled into the study. Three blood samples of 10 ml each were drawn from each patient. Two of the blood samples (Group A and Group B) were centrifuged to form PRF. The third sample was used to measure the baseline blood platelet concentration and was therefore not centrifuged. After PRF had formed in both test groups, it was removed from the test tubes at 2 different times i. <b>e.</b> immediately after <b>centrifuge</b> (Group A) or after 60 min of storage in the blood collecting tube (Group B). The remaining blood was then tested for platelet concentration and compared to each other and the baseline reading.

40|$|A {{series of}} model sterically {{stabilized}} diblock copolymer nanoparticles {{has been designed}} to aid the development of analytical protocols in order to determine two key parameters: the effective particle density and the steric stabilizer layer thickness. The former parameter is essential for high resolution particle size analysis based on analytical (ultra) centrifugation techniques (<b>e.</b> g., disk <b>centrifuge</b> photosedimentometry, DCP), whereas the latter parameter is of fundamental importance in determining the effectiveness of steric stabilization as a colloid stability mechanism. The diblock copolymer nanoparticles were prepared via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) using RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization: this approach affords relatively narrow particle size distributions and enables the mean particle diameter and the stabilizer layer thickness to be adjusted independently via systematic variation of the mean degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks, respectively. The hydrophobic core-forming block was poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) [PTFEMA], which was selected for its relatively high density. The hydrophilic stabilizer block was poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) [PGMA], which is a well-known non-ionic polymer that remains water-soluble over a wide range of temperatures. Four series of PGMA x -PTFEMA y nanoparticles were prepared (x = 28, 43, 63, and 98, y = 100 - 1400) and characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It was found that the degree of polymerization of both the PGMA stabilizer and core-forming PTFEMA had a strong influence on the mean particle diameter, which ranged from 20 to 250 nm. Furthermore, SAXS was used to determine radii of gyration of 1. 46 to 2. 69 nm for the solvated PGMA stabilizer blocks. Thus, the mean effective density of these sterically stabilized particles was calculated and determined to lie between 1. 19 g cm(- 3) for the smaller particles and 1. 41 g cm(- 3) for the larger particles; these values are significantly lower than the solid-state density of PTFEMA (1. 47 g cm(- 3)). Since analytical centrifugation requires the density difference between the particles and the aqueous phase, determining the effective particle density is clearly vital for obtaining reliable particle size distributions. Furthermore, selected DCP data were recalculated by taking into account the inherent density distribution superimposed on the particle size distribution. Consequently, the true particle size distributions were found to be somewhat narrower than those calculated using an erroneous single density value, with smaller particles being particularly sensitive to this artifact...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Romain Legrand, Kuniko Takagi & Sergueï Fetissov ### Abstract Circulating peptide hormones such as ghrelin physiologically bind plasma {{immunoglobulins}} (Ig) which protect hormone from {{degradation and}} modulate its biological activity depending on affinity of hormone / IgG binding. Because the IgG set {{of each individual}} is unique, measuring affinity kinetics of human or animal plasma IgG binding to a specific peptide hormone may provide useful information towards understanding of individual variability in peptidergic signaling. Here, we describe a protocol of IgG preparation from human blood samples adapted {{for the analysis of}} affinity kinetics binding between IgG and peptide hormones measured by the surface plasmon resonance. The same protocol can be also applied to analyze IgG in rodents. ### Introduction Intercellular chemical transmission is mediated by various types of molecules including peptide hormones and neuropeptides which are important messengers in the regulation of homeostatic functions and behavior (1). Peptide messengers are quite different from the classical neurotransmitters such as catecholamines, GABA or glutamate. Some distinguishing features include peptide extrasynaptic release, absence of reuptake and the nanomolar affinity for their receptors which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family (2). High affinity receptor binding of peptides determines the specificity of peptide action on each receptor subtype which may depend on peptide length and posttranslational modifications. In fact, after release, peptide messengers are quickly degraded by various enzymes present in plasma and extracellular space (3). Furthermore, peptide hormones released in the systemic circulation must travel long distances before reaching their target tissues, e. g. ghrelin released from stomach has its targets in the brain and other distant organs and tissues (4). These features of peptidergic signaling imply that biological action of peptides should depend on preservation of their intact structures. The cumulative evidence indicate that immunoglobulins (Ig) may play a role of natural carrier molecules for neuropeptides and, hence, may constitutively participate in peptidergic signaling (5, 6). Indeed, neuropeptide-reactive IgG are ubiquitously present in humans and rodents without exogenous antigenic stimulation (7). In the associated publication we showed that plasma IgG protect peptide hormone ghrelin from degradation by plasma enzymes, thereby, preserving peptide biological activities (8). Furthermore, differences in IgG affinities for peptide hormones can change peptide carrier properties resulting in enhancement or in diminishment of peptide biological activities. For instance, increased IgG affinities for ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone, was associated with increased appetite in patients with obesity. In contrast, increased dissociation rates of IgG for ghrelin were found in patients with anorexia nervosa (8). Another example is a decreased association rate of plasma IgG binding to adrenocorticotropic hormone which was found in male adolescents with antisocial behavior (9). Thus, analysis of affinity kinetics of human or animal plasma IgG binding to a specific peptide hormone may provide useful information towards understanding of individual variability in peptidergic signaling impacting on physiology and behavior and may help to develop new therapeutic approaches. In this protocol we describe the procedure of IgG purification from plasma adapted for its further use for affinity kinetic analysis with the surface plasmon resonance of IgG binding to peptide hormones. ### Materials 1.

It is based on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that express, from the endogenous loci, remodelers fused with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) -tag. Two versions of the TAP-tag, introduced at the C terminus, have been used successfully: (FLAG 3 -TEV-HA) and (FLAG-HA). ES cells are first fixed either with formaldehyde, or {{with a combination of}} disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and formaldehyde. ES cells are then permeabilized, and incubated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome into mononucleosomes. These nucleosomes are then incubated with agarose beads coupled with an antibody against HA or FLAG epitopes. After a series of washes, tagged-remodeler-nucleosome complexes are eluted, either by TEV protease cleavage or by peptide competition. The eluted protein is then subjected to a second immunopurification step, using beads coupled to the antibody against the second HA or FLAG epitope. After elution, DNA is extracted from the highly purified mononucleosome fraction, and processed for high-throughput sequencing. ### Materials 1. Solution I: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 15 mM, Sucrose 0. 3 M, KCl 60 mM, NaCl 15 mM, MgCl 2 5 mM, EGTA 0. 1 mM Solution II: Solution I with 0. 6 % (v/v) IGEPAL CA- 630 (SIGMA, ref. I 3021) - MNase buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, CaCl 2 1 mM - TKNSE buffer: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, Sucrose 0. 34 M, KCl 15 mM, NaCl 60 mM, EDTA 4 mM - TEGN: Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5) 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, MgCl 2 3 mM, EDTA 0. 1 mM, 10 % Glycerol, 0. 01 % IGEPAL - SDS elution buffer: 1 % SDS, 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 ### Procedure 1. Preparation of ES cells - Prior to the experiment, expand ES cells to twelve 70 - 80 % confluent 10 cm culture dishes (1. 5. 10 e 7 cells/dish). Tagged ES cells are cultured at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2, on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (feeder cells), in DMEM (Sigma) with 15 % fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), pen/strep (Invitrogen), 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and a saturating amount of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as described in (Tessarollo, 2001). - The day before the experiment, pass the cells into twenty five 10 cm culture dishes coated with gelatin, without feeder cells. Between 30 and 50. 10 e 7 cells are expected for one tandem ChIP experiment. - The first day of the procedure, 2 h before starting the protocol, check the aspect and confluence of ES cells. Change the ES cell medium, using precisely 10 ml of fresh medium per 10 cm dish, and further incubate the cells for 2 h at 37 °C, 5 % CO 2. - Set a water bath at 37 °C, and refrigerate the <b>centrifuge</b> (<b>e.</b> g. 5810 R eppendorf centrifuge, with an A- 4 - 62 rotor). Put the following solutions on ice: Solution I, Solution II, MNase buffer, Complete 50 x (Roche, ref. 11836145001) and PBS 1 X. - When the 2 h incubation period in fresh medium is finished, trypsinize one dish and count the cells (these cells will be used only for counting, in order to calculate the amount of MNase required for genome fragmentation). We expect 1 to 2. 10 e 7 cells per dish. 2. Fixation. Caution: formaldehyde must be manipulated in a chemical fume hood. - Option 1 : Fixation with formaldehyde: - Remove the cells from the incubator and rapidly add 275 μl of formaldehyde 36. 5 % (SIGMA, ref. F 8775) in each dish, directly into the culture medium, and mix well. The final concentration of formaldehyde is 1 %. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. - Option 2 : Fixation with DSG and formaldehyde: - Dilute DSG to 2 mM in PBS. The DSG (Di-(N-succinimidyl) glutarate, Sigma-Aldrich Ref. 80424) stock solution is 500 mM (50 mg in 306 μl of DMSO) - Wash the ES cell culture dishes with 10 ml PBS at room temperature, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. - Add 4 ml of DSG 2 mM solution per 10 cm dish - Shake gently and make sure that the DSG solution has been in contact with all cells in the dish. - Keep the dishes at room temperature under the hood during 45 min. Shake gently 3 - 4 times during this period. - Add 4 ml of 2 % formaldehyde in PBS to each dish (final concentration 1 %). Mix well. - Leave exactly 10 min at room temperature. Removal of the fixation agent and collection of fixed ES cells - Quickly remove the formaldehyde (or DSG + formaldehyde) solution from the dishes by vacuum aspiration (transfer this waste into an appropriate trash recipient). - Immediately wash each dish with 10 ml of cold PBS, and remove the last bits of PBS by vacuum aspiration. Repeat this washing step once. - Add 2 ml of PBS (with protease inhibitors) per dish. - Scrap cells and collect them in four 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. Store the collected cells on ice. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. - Wash each tube of cells twice with 10 ml PBS 1 x without protease inhibitors. - Wash each tube of cells once with 5 ml Solution I. - Centrifuge at 1000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C. 3. Permeabilization of ES cells with IGEPAL - Resuspend each of the four cell pellets in 2 ml Solution I with protease inhibitors. - Add 2 ml Solution II with protease inhibitors. - Mix gently by pipetting or inverting the tubes several times. - Leave 10 min on ice. During this step, the cells are permeabilized by IGEPAL. Note that because of the formaldehyde fixation, nuclei are not efficiently released from the cells. - Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 g (3153 rpm using an eppendorf A- 4 - 62 rotor), 4 °C. 4. Chromatin fragmentation by MNase - Wash each cell pellet twice with 6 ml MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Resuspend each cell pellet in 500 μl MNase buffer (without protease inhibitors). - Mix well with ± 20 up-and-down, using a P 1000 pipetman. Make sure that there are no more clumps of cells. - Transfer the cell suspension of each conical centrifuge tube into a 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. Store on ice. - Dilute MNase (New England Biolab, ref. M 0247 S, 200 units/μl) to a concentration of 10 units/μl in MNase buffer. - Add MNase to each microfuge tube. 60 - 75 units of MNase are required to digest the chromatin of 10 million cells. The optimal amount of MNase has to be tested for each new batch of enzyme. The proper amount of MNase will release mostly mononucleosomes, but di- and tri-nucleosomes should still be visible when a sample is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel. - Mix well with a P 1000 pipetman. - Incubate 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Mix once by inverting the tubes after 5 min of incubation. - Transfer on ice, and add to each tube 20 μl EDTA 100 mM pH 8, 10 μl Complete 50 x, and 5 μl of PMSF 0. 1 M. Store on ice. - Make 4 cycles of sonication using, for instance, a Diagenode Bioruptor: 20 s ON / 40 s OFF. The purpose of this limited sonication step is not to shear chromatin, but to optimize the release of mononucleosomes from the MNase-digested cells. - Centrifuge at 14 000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C. - Collect and pool the supernatants of the four tubes, which correspond to the input chromatin, ready for the first Immunopurification step. Discard the pellets. Collect an 80 μl aliquot of this input chromatin for DNA analysis and quantification, and for western blot analysis. DNA preparation from input chromatin Before DNA analysis, the formaldehyde-mediated cross-link must be reversed. - In a new microfuge tube, add 20 μl of input chromatin, 480 μl H 2 O, 20 μl NaCl 5 M and 0. 5 μl RNase A (30 μg/μl). - Incubate overnight at 65 °C. - add 10 μl EDTA 0. 5 M, 20 μl Tris-HCl 1 M pH 8. 0 and 4 μl proteinase K 10 mg/ml. Incubate 2 h at 55 °C. - Add 500 μl Phenol/Chloroform, vortex 30 s, and centrifuge 10 min at 13000 rpm, at room temperature. - Collect the aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1. 5 microfuge tube. - Add 50 μl of NaAc 3 M pH 5. 2. Mix. - Add 1 ml 100 % ethanol (- 20 °C), and mix by inverting 10 times the tubes. - Precipitate DNA 1 h at - 20 °C (or overnight at 4 °C). - Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C, 13000 rpm. Discard the supernatant, centrifuge again for 30 s and remove the last drop of liquid. - Wash the DNA pellet with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol. Centrifuge and discard all the liquid. - Add 20 TE (Tris-HCl pH 8, 0. 1 mM EDTA). Once prepared, the DNA is run onto a 1. 3 % agarose gel, to analyze the distribution of mono- and oligo-nucleosomes in the input chromatin. In addition, DNA is quantified by measuring the OD at 260 nm. 5. Preparation of HA- or FLAG-agarose beads for steps 1 and 2 of the tandem affinity purification scheme Anti-HA-agarose (ref. A 2095) and anti-FLAG-agarose (ref. A 2220) beads are purchased from SIGMA. - Resuspend the beads, and pipet the required amount of beads into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube: 80 μl of beads (this is the volume of beads estimated after centrifugation, not the volume of slurry) for the first immunoprecipitation step, 40 μl for the second step. - Wash the beads three times with 10 ml TKNSE buffer. Centrifuge one min at 1000 rpm between each wash to collect the beads. - Keep the beads at 4 °C until use. 6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation: first step of the tandem affinity protocol - In four 1. 5 ml microfuge tubes, mix 500 μl of input chromatin with 20 μl of HA antibody-agarose beads. - Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. - Pool the content of the four microfuge tubes into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. - Centrifuge 2 min at 1000 rpm, at 4 °C. - Take an 80 μl aliquot of the unbound fraction of the first IP as a control for western blot analysis (store on ice). - Wash the beads 8 times with 10 ml TEGN. - Resuspend in 500 μl TEGN if elution is to be made by TEV proteolysis, or in 300 μl of TEGN for elution by peptide competition (see below), and transfer into a new 1. 5 ml microfuge tube. - Take a 10 μl aliquot|$|R

Wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer should contain only blue spots. Wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer should contain only red spots*. - i. Set sensitivity for each color separately, such that a maximum number of spots are detected in each of the anti-IL- 2 or anti-IFN-γ coated wells. - ii. Using the software’s embedded algorithm, set compensation such that no blue spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IFN-γ coating buffer and that no red spots are detected in the wells coated with anti-IL- 2 coating buffer. - *Using these settings, a spot that represents the footprint of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion appears purple and is detected when the color of a spot meets the threshold at the intersection of both single colors*. - iii. Count the cells {{in each of the three}} types of antigen-specific cell populations: single IFN-γ responding cells, single IL- 2 responding cells, and IFN-γ/IL- 2 dual cytokine responding cells. - iv.

Make sure exposure of the wells to MeOH is kept to a minimum. If the problem persists, try less concentrated MeOH solutions or replace MeOH with ethanol. - **Problem**: The positive control is weak or negative. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid using cells for which viability is < 70 % after thawing (Step 8). - 2. Avoid cell stress, such as prolonged exposure to concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), insufficient medium, insufficient CO 2, or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. - 3. Increase incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: Spot quality is poor. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Spot quality can be affected in several ways: - 1. A spot with a white center is the result of improper washing of the plate during Step 17; cells remain bound to the membrane and create a “ghost” image during development. Make sure plates are washed vigorously. - 2. Double spots or spots with a cobweb appearance result from plate displacement occurring during Step 16. Ensure plates are not moved during incubation and that the incubator is not located in an active area or near vibrating equipment (<b>e.</b> g., a <b>centrifuge).</b> - 3. Spots that are too dark with a black center make compensation with the counting instrument difficult. Reduce incubation time in Step 23 and/or Step 25. - **Problem**: The response to background stimuli is elevated. **[Step 28]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Avoid cell stress (see solution above for the positive control being weak or negative). - 2. Put cells on a shaker during Step 9 to avoid cell clumping. - 3. In wash steps using R 10 and R 20 media, screen lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to identify ones supporting low background. Some lots result in increased background and it is recommended that these be tested prior to use. If the problem persists, replace FBS with human AB serum. - 4. Check reagents for contaminants. - 5. Filtration may remove precipitated material that could cause background. ### DISCUSSION Immune monitoring methods have become essential tools for understanding the correlates of protective immune responses. The dual-color ELISPOT assay described in this protocol allows for the simultaneous detection of antigen-specific T cells secreting IFN-γ and/or IL- 2. The rationale for selecting cytokines to target in a dual-color ELISPOT assay may vary based on the experimental question being posed. IFN-γ secretion is an antiviral T cell function that is resistant to functional exhaustion in the course of infections characterized by high persistent antigen load and it is the cytokine most frequently assessed in standard ELISPOT assays used to monitor vaccine trials (Shiver et al. 2002; Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2007; Kester et al. 2008). IL- 2 secretion, on the other hand, is sensitive to functional exhaustion in a setting of high persistent antigen load. However, it tends to identify responses that are more likely to be multifunctional, i. e., have the ability to proliferate and effectively control viral replication (Wherry et al. 2003; Harari et al. 2004; Zimmerli et al. 2005). Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) is also used to characterize antigen-specific immune responses. It has the advantage of allowing for extensive phenotyping and functional analyses of the responding cells. However, ICS usually requires a greater number of PBMCs per condition tested, and it is more expensive and less amenable to high-throughput screening than the ELISPOT assay. The ELISPOT assay is at least as sensitive (if not more so) than ICS for detecting antigen-specific cells (Sun et al. 2003; Streek et al. 2009). In resource-limited settings, comprehensive screening with the dual-color ELISPOT could be used to identify specificities that could later be further phenotypically and functionally characterized by multiparametric flow cytometry. Although both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses can be detected with the dual-color ELISPOT, the use of optimal peptides or overlapping 15 -mers usually favors the detection of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells (Boulet et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). However, the ELISPOT assay also allows for the stimulation of T cells with complex antigens such as whole proteins, cell lysates, or whole or apoptotic cells. In the case of complex antigens, these would need to be pre-incubated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) (Schmittel et al. 2000). In this case, antigens would be processed by the APC and appropriately presented to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, with co-stimulatory signals, according to each cell’s specific requirements. In this context, CD 4 + T cells may be more effectively stimulated and, therefore, their responses more accurately detected. In addition, stimulation of T cells with APCs previously exposed to the antigen may favor the detection of antigen-specific cells that were not previously primed in vivo. If the dual-color ELISPOT protocol is adapted to utilize antigen-pulsed APCs as a stimulus, then the APC-priming procedure and incubation time with the responder cells should be optimized. Another caveat of this method is the decreased magnitude of IFN-γ responses, by ~ 15 %, in wells where both IL- 2 and IFN-γ are captured when compared to wells coated with IFN-γ alone (Boulet et al. 2007). This may be a consequence of the mAb-mediated sequestration of IL- 2, which is a known inducer of IFN-γ. Depending on the type of study undertaken, it is therefore necessary to determine whether the information gained from simultaneously detecting both cytokines outweighs the cost of a decreased IFN‐γ magnitude. The dual-color ELISPOT assay has been used to demonstrate the importance of the link between the predominance of different T cell functional subsets in HIV-infected individuals with different clinical outcomes or at different stages of disease (Peretz et al. 2007; Ndongala et al. 2009). ### REFERENCES 1.
