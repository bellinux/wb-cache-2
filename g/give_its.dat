5|$|It {{is likely}} that a small native {{settlement}} occupied the site {{before the advent of}} the Romans, possibly as the main trading station on the boundary between two British tribes, the Corieltauvi in the East Midlands whose later tribal centre was at Ratae Corieltauvorum, and the Cornovii to the west with their original capital Uriconon (which would later <b>give</b> <b>its</b> name to the important Roman British city of Viroconium) at the hill fort on The Wrekin. These tribes offered little resistance to Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to <b>give</b> <b>its</b> authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian {{army was}} {{in the throes of}} reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and Freikorps {{volunteer}} formations from the wars of 1813–1814 {{were in the process of}} being absorbed into the line, along with many Landwehr (militia) regiments. The Landwehr were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not <b>give</b> <b>its</b> best performance– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} <b>give</b> <b>its</b> astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, {{which would have}} seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could <b>give</b> <b>its</b> allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E
