50|$|Matrix tray feeders {{are used}} for large, {{delicate}} or expensive components. They are developed out of the necessity for handling quad <b>flat</b> <b>packs</b> and fine pitch components. These hold the components securely without damaging the fragile leads. An entire matrix-profiled tray of components are moved to bring rows or individual components to pick-up location. This process is often slower compared to tape feeders as the components fed in matrix trays often require higher level of placement accuracy.|$|R

Using environmentally safe materials such as low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paints, formadelhyde-free wood products and fiberwood (composite wood) are the trademark tools for defining green exhibits. Some exhibit furniture products are also constructed to be shipped for <b>flat</b> <b>packing.</b> This helps to decrease shipping costs, reduce packing material, increase fuel efficiency which minimizes the overall carbon footprint of the exhibition.|$|R
50|$|The {{flat package}} was smaller and {{lighter than the}} round TO-5 style {{transistor}} packages previously used for integrated circuits. Round packages were limited to 10 leads. Integrated circuits needed more leads {{to take full advantage}} of increasing device density. Since flat packages were made of glass, ceramic and metal, they could provide hermetic seals for circuits, protecting them from moisture and corrosion. <b>Flat</b> <b>packs</b> remained popular for military and aerospace applications long after plastic packages became the standard for other application fields.|$|R
50|$|Resultantly, {{fitted kitchens}} became {{the trend in}} 1960s UK, {{requiring}} a ramp-up in production scale.

50|$|To make {{connections}} between an integrated circuit and the leads of the package, wire bonds are used, with fine wires connected from the package leads and bonded to conductive pads on the semiconductor die. At {{the outside of}} the package, wire leads may be soldered to a printed circuit board or used to secure the device to a tag strip. Modern surface mount devices eliminate most of the drilled holes through circuit boards, and have short metal leads or pads on the package that can be secured by oven-reflow soldering.
