40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of the first phase of {{research}} that is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It draws on three main sources of evidence – a review of existing research on the impact of <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes</b> in the UK, interviews with senior policy makers in inspectorates and the Local Government Association, and our research on the impacts of the Best Value pilot programme. The overall aims of the research are to review the development of inspection procedures, their impact on local government, and their effectiveness in promoting change. It seeks to monitor the implementation of the new <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes</b> and assess in broad terms their impact from the perspectives of a range of stakeholders. It is also designed to reflect on the implications of <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes</b> for relations between central and local government, for promoting effective and accountable policies and practices, and for bringing about sustainable change in the culture and thinking of local government. The aim of this paper is to identify some of the key issues relating to the development of external inspection of local government functions in order to contribute to the current debate about the effectiveness of these regimes as a means of regulating local public services. The paper therefore provides a preliminary analysis of the scope, style, purpose and effectiveness of the emerging <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes,</b> and some of the key challenges associated with external inspection as a regulatory mechanism. We first examine the increasing importance of external inspection as a means of promoting service improvement. Next, we provide an overview of the remits, resources and approaches of the main inspectorates covering local authority functions. We then examine evidence of the likely impacts of inspection and the range of alternative regulatory mechanisms. Finally, we analyse some of the tensions that we believe exist within emerging <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes</b> and the challenges these pose for central government policy makers, the inspectorates and inspected bodies...|$|R

Specifically, we ask the following question: Should a port manager have {{a small number of}} inspectors inspect arriving ships less stringently or should this manager have a large number of inspectors inspect the same ships more stringently? We use a simple queuing-theoretic framework and show that if decreasing the economic cost of regulation is very important then it makes more sense for the port manager to choose the less stringent <b>inspection</b> <b>regime.</b> In contrast, if reducing the damage from biological invasions is more salient then the port manager ought to pick the more stringent <b>inspection</b> <b>regime.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{inspections}} in invasive species management, the literature has shown that there is frequently a tension between economic cost reduction and inspection stringency. As such, we analyze the properties of two probabilistic <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes</b> {{that are designed to}} screen arriving ships in a seaport for the presence of one or more deleterious invasive species. In the first regime, the seaport inspector screens arriving ships by using fast (less stringent) and slow (more stringent) protocols. In the second regime, the inspector uses a uniformly stringent protocol with stages. We use the theory of continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to delineate both <b>inspection</b> <b>regimes.</b> Next, we derive some key long run performance measures associated with each of these two regimes.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{thorough}} <b>inspection</b> <b>regime</b> for onsite wastewater treatment systems, which is practical and could be implemented on all site conditions across the country. With approximately 450, 000 onsite wastewater treatment systems in Ireland a risk based methodology is required for site selection. This type of approach will identify the areas with the highest potential risk to human health and the environment and these sites should be inspected first. In order to gain the required knowledge to develop an <b>inspection</b> <b>regime</b> in-depth and extensive research was earned out. The following areas of pertinent interest were examined and reviewed, history of domestic wastewater treatment, relevant wastewater legislation and guidance documents and potential detrimental impacts. Analysis of a questionnaire from a prior study, which assessed the resources available and the types of inspections currently undertaken by Local authorities was carried out. In addition to the analysis of the questionnaire results, interviews were carried out with several experts involved in the area of domestic wastewater treatment. The interview focussed on twelve key questions which were directed towards the expert’s opinions on the vital aspects of developing an <b>inspection</b> <b>regime.</b> The background research, combined with the questionnaire analysis and information from the interviews provided a solid foundation for the development of an <b>inspection</b> <b>regime.</b> Chapter 8 outlines the <b>inspection</b> <b>regime</b> which has been developed for this study. The <b>inspection</b> <b>regime</b> includes a desktop study, consultation with the homeowners, visual site inspection, non-invasive site tests, and inspection of the treatment systems. The general opinion from the interviews carried out, was that a standardised approach for the inspections was necessary. For this reason an inspection form was produced which provides a standard systematic approach for inspectors to follow. This form is displayed in Appendix 3. The development of a risk based methodology for site selection was discussed and a procedure similar in approach to the Geological Survey of Irelands Groundwater Protection Schemes was proposed. The EPA is currently developing a risk based methodology, but it is not available to the general public yet. However, the EPA provided a copy of a paper outlining the key aspects of their methodology. The methodology will use risk maps which take account of the following parameters: housing density, areas with inadequate soil conditions, risk of water pollution through surface and subsurface pathways. Sites identified with having the highest potential risk to human health and the environment shall be inspected first. Based on the research carried out a number of recommendations were made which are outlined in Chapter 10. The principle conclusion was that, if these systems fail to operate satisfactorily, home owners need to understand that these systems dispose of the effluent to the 'ground' and the effluent becomes part of the hydrological cycle; therefore, they are a potential hazard to the environment and human health. It is the owners, their families and their neighbours who will be at most immediate risk...|$|R
