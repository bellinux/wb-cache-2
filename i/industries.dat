40|$|Summary This paper {{takes an}} {{integrative}} approach towards dialectics and social movement theories {{in a model}} of regional <b>industry</b> emergence processes. Based on an inductive qualitative investigation we describe how a new <b>industry</b> emerges in a declining and peripheral region dominated by struggling and traditional local <b>industry.</b> The emanating model of regional <b>industry</b> emergence is based on four main processes; framing processes, movement mobilisation processes, inter-industry relational processes and dialectical processes, which together shape the emerging regional <b>industry.</b> This exemplifies how new regional <b>industry</b> mobilisation efforts provide an 'anti-thesis' to traditional <b>industry,</b> and how established <b>industry</b> actors respond with contestation to protect their business concepts. Furthermore we illustrate how new <b>industry</b> actors reframe their concepts to complement dominating traditional <b>industry</b> and to overcome tensions and conflicts. Following dialectic interaction between new and traditional <b>industry</b> we noticed signs of acceptance and synthesis between the newly formed and old <b>industry</b> actors; ultimately resulting in a revitalisation of the region's traditional <b>industry.</b> As such, the paper {{makes a point of}} accounting for agency and productive conflict when understanding regional <b>industry</b> renewal and emergence.
