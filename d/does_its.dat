5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as <b>does</b> <b>its</b> reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as <b>does</b> <b>its</b> synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as <b>does</b> <b>its</b> melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the rivalry}} is {{attributed}} to the bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, also seen between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd <b>does</b> <b>its</b> best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.|$|E

25|$|Juvenile {{and other}} worms of small size have small crowns and radioles, so prefer {{to capture and}} eat very small particles, such as bacterioplankton and {{single-celled}} phytoplankton and zooplankton.

The preferred food size depends on the maximum size achieved by the adult worm.|$|E

25|$|These Bloch {{wave energy}} eigenstates are written with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present {{because there are}} many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as <b>does</b> <b>its</b> energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route11B (NY11B) is a {{state highway}} in {{northern}} New York in the United States. It provides a parallel, more southerly east–west route (but signed north-south) to U.S. Route11 between US11 in Potsdam and US11, NY30, and NY37 in Malone. NY11B serves both the Potsdam Municipal Airport and the riverside hamlet of Nicholville, where NY11B meets NY458. Aside from the two villages {{at each end of}} the route and the hamlet of Nicholville near the midpoint, NY11B passes through rural, lightly populated areas, as <b>does</b> <b>its</b> parent to the north. In Malone, NY11B overlaps NY30 for one block in order to reconnect to US11.|$|E
