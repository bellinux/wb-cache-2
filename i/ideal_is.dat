5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being <b>ideal,</b> <b>is</b> not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} to the set of multiples m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} to the set of multiples of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the ideal of a and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> a principal ideal).|$|E

5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up {{in the realm of}} the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> a principal ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E

50|$|More over, this {{decomposition}} {{is unique}} in the following sense: the set of associated prime <b>ideals</b> <b>is</b> unique, and the primary ideal above every minimal prime in this set is also unique.

25|$|If F {{consists}} of a single element r, the ideal generated by F {{consists of}} the multiples of r, i.e., {{the elements of the}} form rs for arbitrary elements s. Such an <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> called a principal ideal. If every <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> a principal ideal, R is called a principal ideal ring; two important cases are Z and k, the polynomial ring over a field k. These two are in addition domains, so they are called principal ideal domains.|$|E
25|$|Any maximal <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> a prime ideal or, more briefly, is prime. Moreover, {{an ideal}} I is prime if {{and only if}} the factor ring R / I is an {{integral}} domain. Proving that an <b>ideal</b> <b>is</b> prime, or equivalently that a ring has no zero-divisors can be very difficult. Yet another way of expressing the same is to say that the complement R \ p is multiplicatively closed. The localisation (R \ p)−1R is important enough to have its own notation: R'p. This ring has only one maximal ideal, namely pR'p. Such rings are called local.|$|E

Three canonical representations for Laurent binomial difference <b>ideals</b> <b>are</b> {{given in}} terms of the reduced Groebner basis of Z[x]-lattices, regular and coherent difference ascending chains, and partial characters over Z[x]-lattices, respectively. Criteria for a Laurent binomial difference <b>ideal</b> to <b>be</b> reflexive, prime, well-mixed, and perfect are given {{in terms of}} their support lattices. The reflexive, well-mixed, and perfect closures of a Laurent binomial difference <b>ideal</b> <b>are</b> shown to be binomial.

An algorithm is given to decompose a finitely generated perfect binomial difference ideal as the intersection of reflexive prime binomial difference ideals.
