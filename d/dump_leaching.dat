50|$|Once the ore is mined it can {{be treated}} as a whole ore using a <b>dump</b> <b>{{leaching}}</b> or heap leaching processes. This is typical of low-grade, oxide deposits.

50|$|Such oxide ores {{are usually}} leached by sulfuric acid, {{usually in a}} heap {{leaching}} or <b>dump</b> <b>leaching</b> process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with copper sulfate in solution.

Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called cementation. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper.

The solution then percolates through the heap and leaches both the target and other minerals. This process, called the [...] "leach cycle," [...] generally takes from one or two months for simple oxide ores (e.g., most gold ores) to two years (for nickel laterite ores). The leach solution containing the dissolved minerals is then collected, treated in a process plant to recover the target mineral and in some cases precipitate other minerals, and then recycled to the heap after reagent levels are adjusted. Ultimate recovery of the target mineral can range from 30% of contained (run-of-mine <b>dump</b> <b>leaching</b> sulfide copper ores) to over 90% for the easiest to leach ores (some oxide gold ores).|$|E

In another approach, the limiting water potential was determined by equilibrating small amounts of culture medium with atmospheres of relative humidities equivalent to specific water potentials, {{and the ability of}} the organism to grow and oxidize ferrous iron was determined.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} mature Cu heap leach {{facilities}} in the western United States that will face closure in the next decade. However, there is little published information on the response of groundwater systems to the cessation of leaching. Copper <b>dump</b> <b>leaching</b> {{was conducted on the}} Bingham Canyon Eastside waste rock dumps between 1963 and 2000. Leach water discharging from the toe of the waste rock dumps had a typical pH of 2. 9 and a total dissolved solids concentration of about 90, 000 mg/L. During active leaching this water was recirculated, but now it is neutralized as it enters the mine’s tailings and process water circuit. With the end of leach water application, average annual flows discharging from the toe of the dumps have declined rapidly from 1500 L/s in 1998 to approximately 45 L/s in 2004. Average acidity in water discharging from the toe of the dumps declined by almost thirty percent between 2000 and 2005, and since 2003, most solute concentrations have declined by about ten percent. The only exception is Cu concentration which has increased by a factor of four since 2000. Water quality in the underlying saturated bedrock has also begun to improve. Since 2000, sulfate concentrations have declined by a third, alkalinity has increased, and Cu and Zn concentrations have declined by up to ninety percent in water from tunnels that receive at least a portion of their inflows from beneath the waste rock footprint. Water quality in bedrock and alluvium down gradient of the dump toe began to improve after the leach water collection system was upgraded between 1994 and 1996. Arithmetic mean sulfate concentrations in down gradient alluvial monitoring wells declined from a high of 6000 mg/L in 1994 to less than 1000 mg/L in early 2004.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Bioleaching can be {{categorized}} as being either stirred tank type (i. e. bio-oxidation) or irrigation type (i. e. heap/dump bioleaching) yet studies investigating the kinetics of bioleaching systems mostly use empirical data determined from stirred tank type and initial rate experiments in batch cultures or using iso-potential devices. Rate equations deduced from such empirical data is then used to model both the stirred tank type and irrigation type bioleaching systems overlooking {{the possibility that there}} may be significant differences in their environments and therefore the kinetics. Tank bioleaching systems are well mixed suspension systems dominated by planktonic microorganisms (freely suspended in the liquid medium). Heap bioleaching systems on the contrary, are heterogeneous in nature with chemical and physical conditions changing over time and are dominated by sessile microorganisms (attached microorganisms to the surface of a solid). The heap bioleaching system is therefore highly complex compared to the stirred tank-type systems. Microbial growth in bioleaching systems significantly influence the overall bioleaching kinetics yet biological kinetic effects in sessile/ attached environments are not well understood. Heap and <b>dump</b> <b>leaching</b> account for about 20 % of the world’s copper production and are becoming popular methods of copper production from leaching low grade ores. It is therefore important that the kinetics of irrigation type bioleaching systems are well understood. A strategy to determine the microbial kinetics of a sessile microbial population is enforced in this study. From this, empirical data determined from irrigation type environments can then be used to derive equations which can be used to accurately model heap bioleaching systems. Three sets of experiments were conducted to try and achieve this: i. planktonic experiments - investigating the microbial kinetics of a planktonic microbial population ii. attachment experiments - investigating the nature of growth of the microbial population to the surface of a solid substrate during attachment to create a sessile microbial population iii. sessile experiments - investigating the microbial kinetics of the sessile microbial population A pure culture of Leptospirillum ferriphilum (a mesophilic, ferrous iron oxidizing bioleachingmicroorganism) was used in this study.

40|$|Introduction Pyrite {{oxidation}} {{and acid}} mine drainage (AMD) are the serious environmental {{problems associated with}} the mining activities in sulphide ores. The rate of pyrite oxidation is governed by the availability of oxygen (Borden, 2003). Therefore, the identifying oxygen supplying mechanism {{is one of the most}} important issues related to the environmental assessment of waste rock dumps (Cathles and Apps, 1975; Jaynes et al., 1984; Davis and Ritchie, 1986). Although comprehensive researches were performed on the mathematical description of oxygen transport processes using the numerical modeling (Morin et al., 1988; Blowes et al., 1991; Wunderly et al., 1986; Elberling et al., 1994; Jannesar Malakooti et al., 2014), so far, the interactions between these processes and geochemical and mineralogical characteristics has not been studied especially in waste rock dumps. Therefore the main objective of this study is to identify the evidences for knowing the oxygen transport mechanisms in the waste dumps and also, its role in intensity of pyrite oxidation. It is expected that such these structural studies could be useful for better understanding of dominant processes in numerical modeling and also providing environmental management strategies in the study area and other sites by similar characteristics. Materials and Methods In this study, thirty solid samples were collected from six excavated trenches in the waste rock dumps No. 19 and 31 of the Sarcheshmeh porphyry copper mine. Collected samples were studied using several methods such as XRD, ASTM-D 2492, paste pH and grain size distribution. The results obtained from these methods were used with the field observations in order to characterize some detail information about oxygen supplying mechanisms for oxidation reactions in the waste rock dumps. Result The main minerals found by the XRD analysis were quartz and muscovite which were present in all samples. Pyrite, orthose, albite, and chlorite were also present in some samples. The carbonate content as the major neutralizing agent was zero in all samples. Due to the presence of sulfide minerals, mainly as pyrite, and also lack of any carbonate minerals, the AMD generation from the Sarcheshmeh waste rocks during the weathering reactions is predictable. At the Sarcheshmeh mine waste, several secondary minerals such as butlerite, jarosite and gypsum were detected by XRD at some depths. Moreover, amorphous iron oxyhydroxide minerals visually observed in waste dumps were not detected by XRD due to being negligible and low level of crystallinity. Hence, they were measured in terms of (Feo-h) by ASTM standard test method. The ASTM-D 2492 standard test showed that pyrite, sulphate and iron oxyhydroxide minerals (Feo-h) are present in all samples. Against the XRD method, the test even detected the negligible content of the minerals. The paste pH tests showed that 15 samples were acid-producing because they had pH lower than 4. On the basis of moisture content results, the samples by name A 6, A 7, B 1 and B 2 showed high level of moisture which can be sign of the particular status in them. Discussion According to the field observations, channels with a strong flow of warm and humid air were detected in the depth of 3 to 5 meters of the investigated waste rock dumps. High content of humidity (8. 25 and 13. 43 percent) and sulfate (4. 5 and 7. 02 percent) were observed together with low content of pyrite (1. 5 and 6. 23 percent) and acidic paste pH values (3. 13 and 2. 88) around these channels. Therefore, from the relation of these occurrences, it can be inferred that the air convection is important for supply oxygen to pyrite oxidation in the waste dumps of Sarcheshmeh. The results also indicate that, two main factors including grain size distribution and formation of hardpan layer on top of old weathered rocks are responsible for the decreasing of oxygen transformation rate via the molecular diffusion mechanism through the waste rock dumps. Considering the presence of coarse grain and poorly graded material as a proper media for air convection and also hardpan layer as a confining factor in molecular diffusion of oxygen, it can be deduced that the air convection is the main important mechanism to supply oxygen for weathering and oxidation reactions in the waste rock dumps. The abundance of oxygen and high temperatures in such conditions are also favorable for bacterial activities, which can then accelerate the pyrite oxidation in lower depth of dump. It is expected that the results of this study could be useful as a basis for providing the remediation strategies to control acidic drainage. So that knowing the domination of air convection and presence of hardpan justify controlling the flux of oxygen from the coarse material in bottom of waste dump. Therefore, it would be wrong to construct the impermeable layer on the surface of waste dump for arresting the oxygen diffusion as a traditional method in the remediation.

It's discovery in 1972 heralded {{the recognition of the}} Proterozoic Paterson Province, in which it is located, as a polymetallic terrane with the potential for significant gold and base-metal mineralisation. The Paterson Province represents a small exposure (= 36 000 km²) of the large NW -SE trending Paterson Orogen, a continental-scale orogenic belt that passes across northern Western Australia and into central Australia. Rocks in the Paterson Province have recorded a protracted Proterozoic history for this orogenic belt, which includes continent-continent collision at 1250 Ma (Watrara Orogeny) and late-Proterozoic collisional tectonism (the Paterson Orogeny) between 700 and 600 Ma. The latter generated considerable mineralisation in middle- to late-Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Paterson Province. Late-Proterozoic mineralisation in the Paterson Province is well developed in the NE region where numerous syn- and post-tectonic granitoids, gabbros and dolerites intruded the metasedimentary sequence. However, mineral exploration in this region is commonly hindered by extensive Phanerozoic and Tertiary cover that precludes observation of much of the Proterozoic sequence. Additionally, the province lies within the Great Sandy Desert, and is thus covered by extensive aeolian sand deposits. The large amount of younger cover has resulted in relatively small scattered "windows" that expose the mineralised Proterozoic rock sequence. The NE region of the Paterson Province provides one of the best exposures of this sequence and hosts the Telfer deposit. Sampling of gossanous and stratabound quartz veining in the Telfer Dome (a regional antiformal fold) in 1972 by geologists from both Day Dawn Minerals and Newmont Pty Ltd identified gold enriched horizons within the pelitic sedimentary sequence (Telfer Formation) exposed in the dome. Subsequent drilling of these horizons confirmed an initial resource of 1 Million ounces of gold and mining activity commenced in 1975. During the early 1980 's mining concentrated on one particular reef that outcropped in Main Dome, a sub-dome of the Telfer Dome. This reef, the Middle Vale Reef (MVR) exhibited strong secondary enrichment of gold and has historically comprised a significant resource in the Telfer deposit (Dimo, 1990). During the middle to late 1980 's a shift to high-volume low-grade mining was facilitated by the ongoing success of <b>dump</b> <b>leach</b> extraction of gold from rocks previously too low-grade to be milled. This incresased throughput caused production to expand to the second subdome (West Dome) as the E-Reefs were mined, and helped to make Telfer one of the top four gold producers in Australia during the late 1980 's. More recently, deep diamond drilling in Main Dome (commenced in 1992) has led to the discovery of approximately ten to twelve new reefs at depth in the dome. Underground mining, which had commenced in 1990, has been extended through an exploration decline 10 the upper of these newly discovered reefs (MIO and M 30). This decline is currently being extended to reach the deepest reef, the 130, at approximately 1 100 m below the present ground surface. This should occur by the end of 1997. Another consequence of the deep drilling has been the further confirmation of an epigenetic genesis for the Telfer deposit. and particularly the identification of mineralisation in units other than the Telfer Formation. Initial research on the stratabound reefs in the Telfer deposit suggested that they had formed through syngenetic exhalative processes (Tyrwhitt, 1979; Turner, 1982). A variation on this, whereby the MVR was considered to have formed as an evaporite horizon that was subsequently replaced by quartzsulphide assemblages, was proposed by Royle (1985). However, the expansion of mining and deep drilling within the deposit provided increasing evidence for an epigenetic origin. This came both through structural observations and geochemical fluid-inclusion studies that indicated the reefs were locally discordant, had associated stockwork veining in both the foot- and hanging-walls, contained magmatic elements in the ore-assemblage and that the ore-fluids were of variable salinity and temperature (Goellnicht, 1987). These observations led to an epigenetic model whereby magmatic fluids from the regional granitoids had mixed with cooler connate/formational waters, and had precipitated in structurally controlled, and compositionally favourable, sites within the Telfer Dome (Goellnicht, 1987; Goellnicht et al., 1989). Subsequent research downgraded the role of the granites, suggesting that they acted more as heat sources to convectively circulate connate/contact-metamorphic fluids that scavenge elements from the sedimentary sequence (Hall & Berry, 1989; Rowins. 1994). The changing ideas on the genesis of the Telfer mineralisation are reflected in the changing focus of mineral exploration in the Telfer region and the Paterson Province. Initial exploration, utilising the syngenetic exhalative model, concentrated on locating further outcropping Telfer Formation. The inferred variable thickness of exhalative lenses was considered to have assisted the formation of the regional domal antiforms (Turner, 1982), and consequently those domes that exposed the Telfer Formation were targeted. However, recognition of an epigenetic genesis has focussed exploration activity towards targeting favourable host structures, such as regional folds and other ore-fluid traps. The change in exploration strategy means that a greater reliance is now placed on the structural geological setting of mineralisation in the Paterson Province. This study represents the first formal examination whereby the structural geological setting of mineralisation in the Telfer Mine is integrated with the regional- and orogenic-scale tectonic development of the Paterson Province...|$|R
40|$|Sediments in two aquatic environments {{have been}} investigated. Both are anthropogenically {{affected}} and polluted. The {{focus has been}} on stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, C/N ratios, and heavy metals. The first site is Höggarnsfjärden Bay in the inner parts of the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden, where a garbage <b>dump</b> releases treated <b>leach</b> water. The effect on carbon and nitrogen in the sediment close to the discharge is large, but 1200 m downstream the effect is diluted by the background discharge of the town of Stockholm and the Lake Mälaren, which drains into the archipelago. The main source of the studied metals is not the garbage dump itself. The sediment close to the discharge shows high enrichment factors due to high sedimentation rate and adsorption, and low decomposition of organic matter. The metal enrichment factors of downstream sites are not higher than the upstream sites. The second site is Lake Verkasjön close to the north part of Lake Vättern, in the county of Örebro, Sweden. River Salaån flows through Lake Verkasjön on the way through a former mining area to Lake Vättern. Upstream of Lake Verkasjön an ore dressing plant site was used in 1877 - 1881 for extraction of zinc. During that period the sediment of Lake Verkasjön received high loadings of sulphidic tailings. Normal sedimentation after the event has lead to that the polluted sediment is found as a distinct layer at 18 - 22 cm. The layer is characterized by elevated metal concentrations, decreased organic matter content and increased stable carbon composition. The sediment that has accumulated above 18 cm works as a physicochemical barrier that seals the waste from the overlying sediment. At the time of the event the signal of aquatic production in the sediment changed; the sediment above the layer has an increased proportion of aquatically produced material, implying changed land use in the catchment area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Europe, most of {{the primary}} {{resources}} with high or moderate metal grade, reasonable accessibility and easy to process are exhausted. European primary resources still available for exploitation have more complex mineralizations (e. g. polymetallic and polymineral, carbon rich), or low metal contents; they also {{have higher levels of}} toxic impurities such as arsenic, antimony and mercury, penalizing current pyrometallurgical technologies. As existing processes and technologies are often not profitable for these types of unconventional resources, new process options still need to be developed in order to overwhelming the complexity of the ore composition while remaining cost effective. In this context, bioleaching is more and more considered as a promising technology. Even though heap and <b>dump</b> bacterial <b>leaching</b> of sulphidic minerals are well established and the bacterial treatment of refractory gold concentrate using stirred tank reactors (STR) is an industrial reality, the European mineral industry is still sceptical and reluctant to adopt biohydrometallurgical techniques. Heap leaching is often considered as un-adapted due to space constraints, slow leaching kinetics and low recovery rate. The possibility of using STR for the treatment of other metals than refractory gold, such as copper sulphides, has already been demonstrated but improvements are still needed to achieve economic viability. The Kupferschiefer deposits host the largest known copper reserve in Europe [1]. These black shale type ores are currently exploited in Poland through pyrometallurgical smelting. In Germany exploration campaigns were recently leaded in order to assess and prepare future exploitation of this ore deposit type. The main copper-bearing minerals are: chalcocite, bornite, chalcopyrite and covellite. This type of ore is also characterized by high amounts of carbonate and organic carbon as well as potentially rich with arsenic (volatile in pyrometallurgical processes). In the last years the ores are characterized by increased As and C contents, and lower Cu contents. It leads to a lower quality concentrate as well as operating and environmental issues during smelting. In this context, several European research projects have been dedicated to the development of new bioleaching approaches as alternative and complementary routes to the conventional smelting methods for the processing of Kupferschiefer ores (BioShale in EC-FP 6, ProMine in EC-FP 7, BIOMOre). By using a multi-scale approach from molecular techniques to bench-scale small pilot continuous tests, Cu recovery from this type of ores using bioleaching was demonstrated to be technically feasible and efficient. The stirred tank bio-reactor (STR) was shown as the best process option when compared to heap leaching due to the high content of carbonate in the ore. This paper gives an overview of the work performed on this topic in the last decade. The R&D challenges necessary to tackle in order to improve the process economy will be analysed and compared. It will also discuss the new insights and future developments brought by ECOMETALS, a German and French joint research project, for the integration of bioprocess options in the metallurgical treatment of Kupferschiefer ores...|$|R
40|$|Malawi {{is one of}} many {{countries}} throughout the world struggling with massive amounts of water hyacinths (Eichornia crassipes) in the country’s fresh water resources.   In nutrient-rich ecosystems where the aquatic weed has no natural enemies it will reproduce very rapidly with the consequence that lakes become overgrown, water flow in rivers is reduced, and other water organisms becomes excluded. At the same time, the plants form a good breeding place for species carrying tropical diseases for example Malaria and Bilharzia. Water hyacinths are usually more of a problem for poorer countries since there are often great economic losses caused by the weed and to control their relative abundance is costly. In Malawi, 99 % of the produced electricity is based on water resources, mainly through hydropower turbines in the main river, Shire River. Water hyacinths, aggregated as islands, floating along the river and clogging the turbines cause repeated electricity black-outs and approximately 140 megawatt power is lost every day. To counter the weed interference with the electricity supply, there are great amounts of water hyacinths harvested every day and dumped along the road, with no further disposal plan. In this report, soil from one local dumping area is analysed to determine if such places are leaching nutrients or metals to the surrounding environment.   Water hyacinths contain naturally high values of nutrients and farmers use these harvested plants as a green manure to improve soil properties on agricultural land. This paper aims to examine levels of metal in water hyacinths used as green manure. This is of interest since water hyacinths have the ability to effectively absorb substances from the water body which could pose a risk for potentially toxic elements (PTEs) to accumulate in the agricultural soil and subsequently in crops. Sampling and analyses were carried out with standard methods. Metal and nutrient levels in the analysed samples were obtained through detection with atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), ion chromatography (IC) and UV/VIS spectrophotometry at the Department of Chemistry of Chancellor College in Zomba, Malawi. None of the investigated metal ions (Cr, Pb, Cd) were found in the analysed water hyacinths and since soil sampling was done during the dry season this thesis cannot determine if the <b>dumping</b> areas are <b>leaching</b> nutrients. Relatively high amounts of total phosphorus were found in the plants. Overall, the conclusion {{is that there is no}} risk of using water hyacinths harvested in Shire River as a green manure on agricultural land. ...|$|R
40|$|Lanthanides, {{also called}} rare earth {{elements}} (REE) are key elements in modern technologies and especially in green technologies such as energy generation through wind power. Thus, they are of considerable economic importance with a global production of around 124 000 t REE per year. A detailed environmental assessment with identification of all risks is the foundation to assess the sustainability of mining, processing and separation processes. Rare earth elements usually are found together with actinides such as uranium and thorium. Therefore, actinides and their decay products are simultaneously enriched during the processing of REE. In addition to conventional REE minerals such as monazite or bastnasite, the mineral eudialyte {{can be used as}} a REE source. Even though, the total share of REE is low, the most important REE needed for industrial usages are strongly represented in eudialyte. Furthermore, the proportion of radioactive impurities is very low. Eudialyte is currently not used as source mineral, but might play a bigger role on the global market in the future. Little information about the environmental impacts of REE-production is available to the public, in particular with regard to its radioactive by-products. Thorium is the most prominent of these and has therefore been characterized in detail for its ecotoxicity. A first goal of this work was to evaluate the α- emitter thorium and its impact on the environment. To this aim, an intensive literature search was conducted and results were prepared including the long-term effects of thorium dust and gaseous emissions. Therefore and because ecotoxicological testing of gaseous emissions was technically difficult and environmentally less relevant – unlike its immense impact for exposed industrial workers and bystanders – the water effluent und solid waste streams were investigated with aquatic and terrestrial toxicological experiments. The knowledge gained is meant to supplement the missing data for thorium. A throughout analysis of thorium fluxes along the process of SEE recovery was carried out, and the effects of disposals and other products involved were measured based on ecotoxicological tests with aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In experiments with thorium exclusively the heavy metal property was regarded since radiation effects with a radioactivity half-life of approximately 14 billion years play a subordinate role in typical ecotoxicological testing periods. Moreover, it should be noted that thorium occurs in nature alongside its decay products. Th(OH) 4 at pH 6. 5 to 8 showed no toxic effects in all organisms studied, aquatic (bacteria, algae and daphnia) and terrestrial (springtails, earthworms). Thorium thus does not appear to be a problem in the range of water solubility and in soil concentrations typical found. The effects of process wastewater from various process steps in the production of REE were evaluated based on eudialyte, which was investigated as an example for REE minerals. Figure 1 shows the investigated process steps of eudialyte: after mining, drill, blast and load haul operation, the ore is milled and grinded. In order to enrich it, the wanted mineral is flotated. Afterwards chemicals (acids) are added to dissolve the minerals. Impurities are removed by pH adjustment and precipitation which is also used for REE separation later. Stronger REE separation is achieved by solvent extraction and finally pure REE are obtained by electrolysis. Ground and flotated eudialyte had no or very little ecotoxicological effects. By contrast, leaching residues showed that concentrations which arise during production have a negative impact on all tested organisms (see figure 1). Due to mixture toxicity, it is difficult to estimate which compound is responsible for the total toxicity. It is known that the toxicity of metals differs in various organisms. A general trend shows the following toxicity sequence: Hg> Ag> Cu> Cd> Zn> Ni> Pb> Cr> Sn (Luoma & Rainbow 2011; Merian et al. 2004; F. Scheffer & Schachtschabel 2010). In soil the pH value (soil acidity) has the greatest impact on the metal availability. If the pH value increases, the mobility of heavy metals decreases and thus their availability is reduced. The current study showed that residues from rare earth mining should be stored in a way that ensures that wash-out processes do not affect the water or soil systems. Even tailing dams should be avoided, since otherwise leaching residues can still be washed out, and, on the other hand, terrestrial organisms may be adversely affected. In conclusion, the <b>dumping</b> of <b>leaching</b> residues should be monitored so that they will not pass freely to stockpiles. Additionally, it is important to avoid fine dust which is produced by grinding processes and must not drift. This can be achieved by continuous humidification of stockpiles...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic (As), a very {{poisonous}} {{inorganic pollutant}} {{is a major}} toxicant at porphyry coppermines the principal source of copper production worldwide. It is important to find a suitablemethod to control or stabilize the toxic arsenic species that could be released from the largeamounts of waste at copper mines. Among the current treatment processes for arsenic control atcopper mine waste, retention of arsenic by schwertmannite (a ferric oxyhydroxy sulfate mineral,Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 8 - 2 x(SO 4) x with x typically 1 – 1. 75) has attracted much attention in recent years due to itsstrong binding affinity to toxic arsenic species. It may also be cost-effective {{as it may be}} possibleto synthesize schwertmannite from solutions generated in heap leach operations at copper mines. Such leach solutions generally contain high concentrations of Fe 3 + and SO 42 −, the components ofschwertmannite. In this study, on-site synthesis of schwertmannite at porphyry copper mines byneutralization technique was proposed. First, synthesis of schwertmannite from the simulatedcopper heap leach solutions was investigated. The efficiency in arsenic removal by the synthesizedschwertmannite and the stability of arsenic-sorbed schwertmannite were then evaluated,respectively. Finally, the applications of schwertmannite in As control of copper mine wastes weredemonstrated. In Chapter 1, the background and the objectives of the study were presented. The sources ofarsenic contamination resulting from copper production were pointed out. The various approachfor arsenic wastes control in mining and metallurgical operations was reviewed andschwertmannite was selected as an ideal technique applying for control the toxic arsenic speciesthat could be presented from such large amounts of waste at copper mines. On-site synthesis ofschwertmannite by neutralization of the copper heap leach solutions was subsequently proposed. The synthesis is expected to be performed by neutralizing the leach solutions to pH 3 – 4. Thesynthesized schwertmannite can be expected to find application in arsenic immobilization ofcopper mine waste in tailings and spent ore of either <b>dump</b> or heap <b>leach</b> piles. Chapter 2 provided insight into the production of schwertmannite in porphyry copper minesby investigating the effect of co-existing metal ions (Cu 2 + and Fe 2 +) and the reaction temperatures(25 ˚C and 65 ˚C) on the synthesis of schwertmannite by neutralization technique. It is shown thatCu 2 + and Fe 2 + play an important role for the schwertmannite synthesis at 65 ˚C. However, Cu 2 + andFe 2 + did not affect the synthesis at 25 ˚C. It was observed that schwertmannite is formed at both 25 ˚C and 65 ˚C at all experimental conditions except for the solutions containing Fe 2 + at 65 ˚C, asgoethite was generated at these conditions. It was found that goethite is formed by transformationof intermediated schwertmannite during the synthesis at 65 ˚C. However, Cu 2 + has the ability toinhibit the transformation of schwertmannite to goethite in the presence of Fe 2 +. Although it ispossible to synthesize schwertmannite at both temperatures, their surface characteristics aredifferent. The specific surface area of the schwertmannite synthesized at 65 ˚C was much larger(147. 4 - 176. 9 m 2 g- 1) than the specific surface area of the schwertmannite synthesized at 25 ˚C(14. 1 - 21. 4 m 2 g- 1), which this may affect their efficiency for arsenic removal. In Chapter 3, arsenic sorption capacities by the synthesized schwertmannite were evaluated. The results indicate that As(V) in acidic solutions (pH 3 - 4) can be removed effectively byschwertmannite synthesized in {{the presence or absence of}} co-existing metal ions (Cu 2 + and Fe 2 +) at 65 ˚C with the maximum sorption capacity of 94 - 133 mg g- 1. A lower As(V) sorption capacity isobserved in product containing goethite synthesized in the presence of Fe 2 + at 65 ˚C; here, themaximum As(V) sorption capacity is 58 mg g- 1. The maximum As(V) sorption capacities byiischwertmannite synthesized at 25 ˚C are 17 - 23 mg g- 1, which are much lower than the maximumsorption capacities of the schwertmannite synthesized at 65 ˚C. This should be taken intoconsideration for its application on mine sites. In Chapter 4, the stability of As(V) -sorbed schwertmannite (Sch-As) under porphyry coppermining conditions was studied by investigating the effect of Cu 2 +, Fe 2 +, pH, and ageing time on thestability of Sch-As. The results indicated that Cu 2 + has no significant effect on the stability of Sch-As and that the As(V) incorporated into schwertmannite can retard or significantly inhibit the Fe 2 +-catalyzed transformation of schwertmannite to goethite under acidic conditions (pH 3 – 4). The Sch-As aged at different pH ranges from 3 to 11 at 25 °C exhibits no mineralogical phase changes evenafter ageing for 120 -days; however the concentration of arsenic released from the solid phaseappeared to be strongly pH-dependent also at ageing for 24 h. The release of As was almostnegligible at pH 2 to 7, and a high release of As was observed at extremely acidic and alkalineconditions. This indicates that the release of As from Sch-As is controlled by environmental factorssuch as pH rather than time. In Chapter 5, applications of the synthesized schwertmannite for arsenic immobilization incopper mine wastes were demonstrated. The study was divided into two models experiments. Thefirst part was to demonstrate the application of schwertmannite for immobilization of arsenic intailings resulting from copper flotation operations. The results indicated that high arsenicconcentration was observed for the experiment without the addition of schwertmannite, which thismay be due to the oxidation of arsenopyrite. The concentration of arsenic became significantlylower when schwertmannite was added; suggesting that schwertmannite synthesized from copperheap leach solutions may be suitable for arsenic immobilization in copper flotation tailings. Thesecond part of this chapter was focused on the possibility in applying the synthesizedschwertmannite for arsenic immobilization in mine waters containing the diluted concentration ofarsenic. The high arsenic concentration is essential for long-term stability of schwertmannite. Thesynthesized schwertmannite was used as the sorbent-desorbent to remove the diluted arsenicconcentration at low pH and strip it back in the high pH solution to generate higher arsenicconcentration. The results indicated that the diluted concentration of As(V) in acidic solution canbe sorbed efficiently by schwertmannite; and the arsenic can also strip back or release from theAs(V) -sorbed schwertmannite at alkaline pH condition, suggesting that the synthesizedschwertmannite may be suitable for arsenic treatment for the solution with diluted concentration ofarsenic. In Chapter 6, the summary and conclusions of the study were presente...|$|R
