5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom").

Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E

500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{her work}} with the Union Theatre, Florance {{continued}} to perform with the Little Theatre, Her performance as Teresa Browne with Moira Carleton and Syd Conabere in the first Australian production of Graham Greene's The Living Room (26 October 1954 – 6 November 1954) was described as [...] "outstanding and perfect in gentle pathos". The following year she {{was back at the}} Union Theatre in Mel Dinelli's The Man (14 November 1955 – 26 November 1955). One reviewer wrote, [...] "as the incredible Mrs. Gillis, Sheila Florance stressed incredibility <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> was worth".|$|E

60|$|Cecilia's heart ached with {{a little}} ache <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the times <b>she</b> had thought: 'If father were only not quite so---'; <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the times <b>she</b> had shunned asking {{him to come to}} them, because he was so---; <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the silences <b>she</b> and Stephen had {{maintained}} after he had spoken; <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the little smiles she had smiled. She longed to go and kiss his brow, and make him feel that she was aching. But she did not dare; he seemed so far away; it would be ridiculous.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the popular}} fictional work I, Claudius by Robert Graves—based on Tacitus' innuendo—Livia {{is portrayed as}} a {{thoroughly}} Machiavellian, scheming political mastermind. [...] Determined never to allow republican governance to flower again, as she felt they led to corruption and civil war, and devoted to bringing Tiberius to power and then maintaining him there, she is involved in nearly every death or disgrace in the Julio-Claudian family up {{to the time of}} her death. [...] In her deathbed she only fears divine punishment <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had done, and secures the promise of future deification by her grandson Claudius, an act which, she believes, will guarantee her a blissful afterlife. [...] However, this portrait of her is balanced by her intense devotion to the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and her machinations are justified as a necessarily cruel means to what she firmly considers a noble aspiration: the common good of the Romans, achievable only under strict imperial rule. [...] In the 1976 BBC television series based on the book, Livia was played by Siân Phillips. Phillips won a BAFTA for her portrayal of the role.|$|E
