25|$|Australia's second Super 8's {{game was}} not as {{successful}} as their first. Sent in to bat, Australia struggled to find any momentum. While many Australian batsmen got starts, tight Pakistan bowling restricted their scoring chances. Michael Hussey top scored for Australia with 37, {{and at one point}} a total of 180 plus <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> possible for Australia. Effective bowling at the death however, restricted Australia to 7/164 off their 20 overs. During this innings, Australian captain Ricky Ponting received a hamstring strain and was ruled out of action for between two and four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Walayah is {{translated}} from Arabic as “guardianship” and denotes “Love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Aimmat and Imām uz Zaman, and the Dai.” It also denotes Ta'at (following every order without protest, but with one's soul's happiness, knowing {{that nothing is}} more important than a command from God and that the command of His vicegerents is His Word). In Ismāʿīlī doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and He manifests himself in the forms of Prophets and Imāms; to be guided to his path, one requires a messenger or a guide: a Dai. For the true mawali of the Imam and Dai, heaven is made obligatory. And only with this crucial walayat, they believe, will all the other pillars and acts ordained by Islam be judged or <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at by God.|$|E
500|$|In most {{episodes of}} low back pain, a {{specific}} underlying cause is not identified or <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> for, {{with the pain}} believed {{to be due to}} mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by [...] "red flags" [...] such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events.|$|E

500|$|The spire {{was never}} {{repaired}} and the tower was removed {{and replaced by}} a simpler structure; however, the clock was saved and eventually placed in another building on campus, the Stanford Clock Tower. [...] University trustees considered re-building the tower, and <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at possible designs, but eventually chose not to rebuild it {{because they could not}} agree on its design. [...] The crossing structure, {{the only part of the}} building to remain relatively stable after the quake, also pushed the roof of the nave forward, causing the church's front facade to fall into the Inner Quad courtyard as it broke free, which resulted in the destruction of the entire north face of the building; as mosaic expert Joseph A. Taylor put it, [...] "its wondrous mosaic was blown out and totally destroyed". [...] The only mosaics not destroyed in the quake were the four angels that decorated the crossing dome's pendentives. [...] The back of the church, with several hundred feet of arcades, was also completely leveled because it too was not joined to the rest of the building.|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{commented that}} the SIS {{had a history of}} [...] "furnish {{unreliable}} information on the IRA's foreign intrigues." [...] Yet, these past failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. MaMahon suggested that [...] "It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived." [...] Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, [...] "it is now known... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England." [...] Nicholas Mansergh commented that [...] "Ireland had no place" [...] in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton De Wiart commented [...] "I can never believe the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am very grateful for any reason which sent us there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2002–03 was Everton's {{best season}} since the sixth-place finish of 1995–96 {{and for a}} while it had <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> like they would qualify for the Champions League. In the FA Cup the Toffees were on the {{receiving}} end of a giant-killing, away to [...] Shrewsbury Town, who were managed by former Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe and were just four months away from being relegated from the Football League. The following season's league form was a stark contrast, with the club finishing 17th and accumulating the lowest points total in the club's history.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} a fifteen-year period of intense {{experimentation}} {{beginning in the}} mid-1940s that Louise Nevelson evolved her sculptural wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of furniture, pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's Sky Cathedral (1958), the Museum of Modern Art catalogue states, [...] "As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, Sky Cathedral has the pictorial quality of a painting..." [...] Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> through.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1985, Savage {{signed with}} Vince McMahon. Billed as [...] "the top free agent in pro wrestling", Savage's first {{appearances}} on Tuesday Night Titans featured several established managers (including Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, and [...] "Classy" [...] Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage. He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, {{participating in a}} 16-man tournament.

2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who conducted an investigation into how regulators had failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Madoff said {{he could have been}} caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like [...] "Lt. Colombo" [...] and never asked the right questions: I was astonished. They never <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at my stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been easy for them to see. If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's the first thing you do. Madoff said in the June 17, 2009, interview that SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro was a [...] "dear friend", and SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter was a [...] "terrific lady" [...] whom he knew [...] "pretty well".|$|E
2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and {{when he showed up}} at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the [...] "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" [...] by many people who had not <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The strongest {{pathological}} {{association of}} déjà vu is with temporal lobe epilepsy. This correlation {{has led some}} researchers to speculate {{that the experience of}} déjà vu is possibly a neurological anomaly related to improper electrical discharge in the brain, creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. As most people suffer a mild (i.e. non-pathological) epileptic episode regularly (e.g. a hypnagogic jerk, the sudden [...] "jolt" [...] that frequently, but not always, occurs just prior to falling asleep), it is conjectured that a similar (mild) neurological aberration occurs in the experience of déjà vu, resulting in an erroneous sensation of memory. Scientists have <b>even</b> <b>looked</b> into genetics when considering déjà vu. Although there is not currently a gene associated with déjà vu, the LGII gene on chromosome 10 is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, déjà vu, along with jamais vu, occurs often enough during seizures (such as simple partial seizures) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.|$|E
