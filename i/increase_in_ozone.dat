5000|$|As {{reported}} by the European Space Agency (ESA) on September 29, 2013, a new comparison of spacecraft data with computer models explains how global atmospheric circulation creates a layer of ozone (...) above Mars's southern pole in winter. Ozone was most likely difficult to detect on Mars because its concentration is typically 300 times lower than on Earth, although it varies greatly with location and time. The SPICAM —an UV/IR spectrometer— on board Mars Express has shown the presence of two distinct ozone layers at low-to-mid latitudes. These comprise a persistent, near-surface layer below an altitude of 30 km, a separate layer that is only present in northern spring and summer with an altitude varying from 30 to 60 km, and another separate layer that exists 40-60 km above the southern pole in winter, with no counterpart above the Mars's north pole. This third ozone layer shows an abrupt decrease in elevation between 75 and 50 degrees south. SPICAM detected a gradual <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration at 50 km until midwinter, after which it slowly decreased to very low concentrations, with no layer detectable above 35 km. The reporting scientists think that the observed polar ozone layers {{are the result of}} the same atmospheric circulation pattern that creates a distinct oxygen emission identified in the polar night and also present in Earth's atmosphere. This circulation {{takes the form of a}} huge Hadley cell in which warmer air rises and travels toward the south pole before cooling and sinking at higher latitudes. Mars is on a quite elliptical orbit and has a large axial tilt, which causes extreme seasonal variations in temperature amongst the northern and southern hemispheres. Mars's temperature difference greatly influences the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, because warmer air can contain more moisture. This, in turn, affects the production of ozone-destroying hydrogen radicals.|$|E

40|$|Surface ozone is a {{secondary}} air pollutant produced during the atmospheric photochemical degradation of emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) {{in the presence of}} sunlight and nitrogen oxides (NO x). Temperature directly influences ozone production through speeding up the rates of chemical reactions and increasing the emissions of VOCs, such as isoprene, from vegetation. In this study, we used an idealised box model with different chemical mechanisms (Master Chemical Mechanism, MCMv 3. 2; Common Representative Intermediates, CRIv 2; Model for OZone and Related Chemical Tracers, MOZART- 4; Regional Acid Deposition Model, RADM 2; Carbon Bond Mechanism, CB 05) to examine the non-linear relationship between ozone, NO x and temperature, and we compared this to previous observational studies. Under high-NO x conditions, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> from 20 to 40  °C of up to 20  ppbv was due to faster reaction rates, while increased isoprene emissions added up to a further 11  ppbv of ozone. The largest inter-mechanism differences were obtained at high temperatures and high-NO x emissions. CB 05 and RADM 2 simulated more NO x -sensitive chemistry than MCMv 3. 2, CRIv 2 and MOZART- 4, which could lead to different mitigation strategies being proposed depending on the chemical mechanism. The increased oxidation rate of emitted VOC with temperature controlled the rate of O x production; the net influence of peroxy nitrates increased net O x production per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised. The rate of <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> mixing ratios with temperature from our box model simulations was about half the rate of <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> with temperature observed over central Europe or simulated by a regional chemistry transport model. Modifying the box model set-up to approximate stagnant meteorological conditions increased the rate of increase of ozone with temperature as the accumulation of oxidants enhanced ozone production through the increased production of peroxy radicals from the secondary degradation of emitted VOCs. The box model simulations approximating stagnant conditions and the maximal ozone production chemical regime reproduced the 2  ppbv <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> per degree Celsius from the observational and regional model data over central Europe. The simulated ozone–temperature relationship was more sensitive to mixing than the choice of chemical mechanism.

In well-watered conditions, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration led to a reduction in leaf area, dry matter and reproductive organs.

During the 3 -year study, AOT 40 was significantly correlated with the leaf area and the final above-ground dry matter. The latter was less sensitive to ozone than leaf area.

While this long-term increase is small compared to the intra-regional short-term ozone decrease, it is comparable to or larger than the short-term inter-continental ozone decrease for some source-receptor pairs. The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> methane and long-term surface ozone per ton of NO x reduced is greatest in tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions, exceeding that from temperate Northern Hemisphere regions by roughly a factor of ten. We also assess changes in premature ozone-related human mortality associated with regional precursor reductions and long-range transport, showing that for 10 % regional NO x reductions, the strongest inter-regional influence is for emissions from Europe affecting mortalities in Africa. Reductions of NO x in North America, Europe, the Former Soviet Union, and Australia are shown to reduce more mortalities outside of the source regions than within. Among world regions, NO x reductions in India cause the greatest number of avoided mortalities per ton, mainly in India itself. Finally, by increasing global methane, NO x reductions in one hemisphere tend to cause long-term <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration and mortalities in the opposite hemisphere.

With the model scenarios used here, local <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> of around 50 per cent could occur. We also report measurements of short-lived brominated compounds around Sabah suggesting that oceanic (and, especially, coastal) emission sources dominate locally. The concentration of bromine in short-lived halocarbons measured at the surface during OP 3 amounted to about 7 ppt, setting an upper limit {{on the amount of}} these species that can reach the lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|Ozone is {{typically}} higher on weekends (WE) than on weekdays (WD) {{at many of}} California’s air-monitoring stations. Sometimes called the “ozone WE effect, ” this phenomenon occurs despite substantially lower estimates of WE emissions for the major ozone precursors – volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Compared to WD emissions, WE emissions of NOx decrease more (proportionally) than do the WE emissions of VOC. Because the WE <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> coincide with the relatively large WE reductions in NOx, some conclude that regulations that would reduce NOx emissions on all days would undermine ozone attainment efforts by causing ozone to decrease more slowly (or even to increase). At this time, public discussion of the ozone WE effect has mostly reflected the viewpoint that NOx emission reductions would not help reduce ambient ozone levels. A large body of published research from this perspective has accumulated over the last 10 to 20 years. Nevertheless, the presently available scientific evidence {{can also lead to}} the conclusion that NOx emission reductions may be needed to maintain or even to expedite progress toward attainmen...|$|R
