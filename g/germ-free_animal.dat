40|$|In humans, {{intestinal}} defences develop during gestation and, at full term, {{have the}} capacity to respond in an appropriate manner to infectious agents and foreign antigens. Before an active protective response can occur, however, the gut must first be exposed to colonizing bacteria. Colonization with diverse intestinal microbes is necessary for the development of important gut defenses such as the synthesis and secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A and the generation of a balanced T helper (Th) cell response. Insights into normal immune physiological development of the gut have been made by studying the <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> and intestinal defenses. These studies have provided insights into the physiology of immune responses. Two important immunological functions are the secretion of polymeric immunoglobulin A to protect the intestinal surface against harmful stimuli and inhibition of the systemic response to commensal bacteria and food proteins (eg, oral tolerance) to prevent chronic inflammation. Neither function exists in the germ-free state, but rapidly develops after conventionalization (colonization) of the <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal.</b> In the present review, the importance of bacterial colonization on the appearance of normal mucosal immune function and to the clinical consequences of inadequate colonization to the development of disease will be discussed. For example, excessive Th 2 activity can lead to atopy, whereas Th 1 predominance is found in conditions such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis and Crohn's disease. With the eradication of infectious diseases in developed countries in the past three decades, the incidence of atopic and autoimmune diseases has increased. This epidemiological observation has been explained by the 'hygiene hypothesis', which suggests that a reduction in microbial burden by public health measures has contributed to an immunological imbalance in the intestine. A family of pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors) on gut lymphoid and epithelial cells mediates innate immune responses to bacterial molecular patterns and, thereby, orchestrates acquired immunity. As the role of bacterial communication within the gut (bacterial-epithelial cross-talk) is clarified, physicians should be able to modulate gut immune responses, for example, by the use of probiotics...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophils have crucial {{antimicrobial}} functions but {{are also}} thought to contribute to tissue injury upon exposure to bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To study the role of neutrophils in LPS-induced endotoxemia, we developed a new mouse model, PMNDTR mice, in which injection of diphtheria toxin induces selective neutrophil ablation. Using this model, we found, surprisingly, that neutrophils serve to protect the host from LPS-induced lethal inflammation. This protective role was observed in conventional and <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> facilities, indicating {{that it does not}} depend on a particular microbiological environment. Blockade or genetic deletion of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key neutrophil enzyme, significantly increased mortality after LPS challenge, and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that neutrophil-derived MPO contributes importantly to protection from endotoxemia. Our findings imply that, in addition to their well-established antimicrobial properties, neutrophils can contribute to optimal host protection by limiting the extent of endotoxin-induced inflammation in an MPO-dependent manner.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{commensal}} bacteria on intestinal immune development seem to be profound, it remains speculative whether the gut microbiota influences extraintestinal biological functions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune disease leading to progressive deterioration of neurological function. Although the cause of MS is unknown, microorganisms seem to be important for the onset and/or progression of disease. However, {{it is unclear how}} microbial colonization, either symbiotic or infectious, affects autoimmunity. Herein, we investigate a role for the microbiota during the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. Mice maintained under germ-free conditions develop significantly attenuated EAE compared with conventionally colonized mice. <b>Germ-free</b> <b>animals,</b> induced for EAE, produce lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL- 17 A in both the intestine and spinal cord but display a reciprocal increase in CD 4 ^(+) CD 25 ^(+) Foxp 3 ^+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistically, we show that gut dendritic cells from <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> are reduced in the ability to stimulate proinflammatory T cell responses. Intestinal colonization with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is known to promote IL- 17 production in the gut; here, we show that SFBs also induced IL- 17 A–producing CD 4 ^+ T cells (Th 17) in the CNS. Remarkably, <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> harboring SFBs alone developed EAE, showing that gut bacteria can affect neurologic inflammation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{carrageenan}} {{model for}} ulcerative colitis {{has been studied}} {{in an effort to}} define the role of bacteria in the experimental disease. It was found that guinea pigs given a 5 % w/v carrageenan solution developed cecal ulcerations within 14 days which were histologically similar to lesions seen in the human disease. Bacteriological studies of the cecal contents of carrageenan recipients indicated that both the coliform and. gram negative anaerobic bacterial counts were increased as compared to bacterial counts obtained from healthy control animals. Suppression of cecal bacterial populations with oral antimicrobial agents during carrageenan challenge was used to determine whether specific microfiora populations were necessary for ulceration. It was found that antimicrobials active versus obligate anaerobes prevented cecal ulceration in carrageenan recipients, while antimicrobials active versus gram positive organisms or coliforms did not suppress ulcer development. It was also noted that <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> given carrageenan did not develop typical lesions, but <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> associated with a conventional microflora acquired cecal ulcerations during carrageenan challenge.

Tanikawa and Associate Professor J. Tanami. In our laboratory, a new compact type of rearing unit HMC- 1 was constructed after Reyniers 2 ̆ 7 system and Gustafsson 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus in 1954. Continuously the rearing unit HMC- 2 was constructed with the useful advice given by Professor M. Miyakawa. A thermo-sterilizing plant and glass-wool filter are used for air sterilization. In order to eliminate humidity in the air a fin-coil type refrigerating desicator is used. The ventilation power of pump on the average is 60 1 per minute, and this quantity of air is sufficient for 2 rearing tanks and 1 operating tank. The rearing tank is constructed of steel 6 mm in thickness, the diameter of the tank is 60 cm and the length is 120 cm. Entire surface of the tank is covered with asbestos in 3 cm thickness. This tank has 4 glove ports and 2 viewing ports, gloves are made of artificial rubber and are fixed on the glove ports of the tank with a special ring. The operating tank is almost equal to the rearing tank in its size and shape. This tank has a chamber for the operating trap provided under it. This trap is used for moving an animal into the tank. The sterilizing food clave is a small steel tank, 25 cm in diameter and 65 cm in length. This is used for removing food, water and the other heat steriliable articles into the rearing tank. The germicidal trap is an apparatus through which all objects placed into the rearing tank, which must not be sterilized with heat, must pass. The double Seitz-filter is an apparatus through which certain kinds of solution can be filtered and sterilized. The entire system can be sterilized at the same time, but in accordance with the demands of the experiment procedures, one part of the system, either the rearing tank or the operating tank, must be separately sterilized. Because of this reason a sterilizing pipe system is constructed for that purpose. The air temperature of the rearing tank is controlled by the air temperature regulator and the hot water tank provided under part of the tank, so there must be two electric regulating system for the rearing tank. All sorts of furnishings in the rearing tanks must be provided so as not to injure the,rubber gloves during manipulation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that gut {{bacteria}} contribute significantly to the host homeostasis, providing a range of benefits such as immune protection and vitamin synthesis. They also supply the host with a considerable amount of nutrients, making this ecosystem an essential metabolic organ. In the context of increasing evidence of the link between the gut flora and the metabolic syndrome, understanding the metabolic interaction between the host and its gut microbiota is becoming an important challenge of modern biology. 1 - 4 Colonization (also referred to as normalization process) designates the establishment of micro-organisms in a former <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal.</b> While it is a natural process occurring at birth, it is also used in adult germ-free animals to control the gut floral ecosystem and further determine its impact on the host metabolism. A common procedure to control the colonization process is to use the gavage method with a single or a mixture of micro-organisms. This method results in a very quick colonization and presents the disadvantage of being extremely stressful 5. It is therefore useful to minimize the stress and to obtain a slower colonization process to observe gradually the impact of bacterial establishment on the host metabolism. In this manuscript, we describe a procedure to assess the modification of hepatic metabolism during a gradual colonization process using a non-destructive metabolic profiling technique. We propose to monitor gut microbial colonization by assessing the gut microbial metabolic activity reflected by the urinary excretion of microbial co-metabolites by 1 H NMR-based metabolic profiling. This allows an appreciation of the stability of gut microbial activity beyond the stable establishment of the gut microbial ecosystem usually assessed by monitoring fecal bacteria by DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). 6 The colonization takes place in a conventional open environment and is initiated by a dirty litter soiled by conventional animals, which will serve as controls. Rodents being coprophagous animals, this ensures a homogenous colonization as previously described. 7 Hepatic metabolic profiling is measured directly from an intact liver biopsy using 1 H High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning NMR spectroscopy. This semi-quantitative technique offers a quick way to assess, without damaging the cell structure, the major metabolites such as triglycerides, glucose and glycogen in order to further estimate the complex interaction between the colonization process and the hepatic metabolism 7 - 10.

Effect of {{the normal}} {{microbial}} flora on {{the resistance of the}} small intestine to infection. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 1604 – 1608. 1966. —Mucosal structure in the small intestine is known to be influenced by the normal microbial flora. This suggests that mucosal resistance to invasion by enteric pathogens might also be affected by the flora. To assess this possibility, germ-free and conventional mice were challenged with Salmonella typhimurium, and both the growth of organisms within the intestinal lumen and the translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes were studied quantitatively. There were significantly more organisms 24 hr after intragastric challenge in the mesenteric nodes of <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals</b> than in those of conventional ones. However, since intraluminal growth in the intestine was also greater in <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals,</b> no conclusion could be drawn about mucosal resistance per se.

However, when intestinal emptying was prevented by ileal ligation before challenge, both intraluminal growth and translocation of S. typhimurium were equal in the two groups of mice.

30|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} {{on the effect of}} intestinal microbiota on gut motility derives from studies in <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals.</b> <b>Germ-free</b> rats exhibited longer migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) intervals compared with conventional rats (Caenepeel et al. 1989). Further, the cecum of germ-free rats was enlarged and gastric emptying and colonic transit were delayed (Abrams 1977). Studies colonizing of conventional intestinal microbiota to germ-free rats revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum could reduce the MMC period and accelerate small intestinal transit, while Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli showed an inhibitory effect (Husebye et al. 2001). Barbara et al. put forward three mechanisms responsible for the effects of microbiota on intestinal motility (Barbara et al. 2005): (1) the release of bacterial substances or end-products of bacterial fermentation; (2) intestinal neuroendocrine factors; (3) mediators released by the gut immune response.|$|R
40|$|An {{intestinal}} ecosystem {{has three}} major actors, i. e., the macroorganism, the microflora and the environment. Influences of some exogenous factors on {{functions of the}} intestinal microbes and their interactions within the ecosystem in vivo, have been studied by utilizing the so-called microflora-associated characteristic (MAC) / <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> characteristic (GAC) concept. The parameters were bile acid, urobilinogen, cholesterol faecal tryptic activity (FTA) mucin, beta-aspartylglycine, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The establisment of MACs h 35 germ-free rats was followed. The microbes were introduced in different ways and a faecal enema and social contacts with conventional rats gave rapidly an development of microbial functions. The establishment could be clustered into two groups, I) a rapid development probably depending on the microbes involved ll) a wider time range, probably depending on the way of introduction. The influence of diet was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease, receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and in healthy volunteers given a balanced diet, enteral nutrition (EN), by following six MACs. The results showed greater influence of TPN than EN on bile acids, cholesterol and FTA. Diarrhoea {{is one of the}} most common side-effects of antimicrobial treatment, so-called antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD). SCFAs were investigated in 31 AAD patients and the total amount SCFAs and their distribution were significantly changed compared to healthy adults. Five other MACs were also studied and formation of coprostanol and urobilinogen and faecal tryptic activity were significantly altered in the AAD patients compared to healthy persons. Six MACs were studied in nine AAD patients given a faecal enema. Most of the patients were cured within 4 days. No relapses occurred within 18 months. Different probiotics have been used in order to avoid diarrhoea connected with antimicrobial treatment and an investigation was performed to evaluate the influence of a probiotic on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. A suspension of Lactobacillus delbruekii and Streptococcus thermophilus (LS) was given to 20 rats together with and without clindamycin. This antibiotic has a pronounced effect on most MACs h studies of healthy human and showed similar influence in rats on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. The micbes per se in LS are not claimed to 7 alpha-dehydroxylate bile acids. In the present study, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation was significantly reduced in the rats receiving clindamycin alone, but concomitantly use of LS reduced significantly the antimicrobial effect. Thus, the probiotics significantly influenced on a MAC not related to the microbes per se. In conclusion, the first contacts with microbes are of importance for the establishment of intestinal ecosystems. The metabolic activities of an intestinal ecosystem can be influenced by several exogenous factors such as diet and antimicrobial drugs. Probiotics as well as enemas containing a species-specific faecal flora may restore altered functions. The intestinal ecosystem is a complex interplay, with all main actors involved in maintaining a "balanced unbalance...|$|E
40|$|Mucins, {{synthesised}} and secreted by goblet cells, possess potential binding {{sites for}} both commensal and pathogenic organisms, and may perform a defensive role during {{establishment of the}} intestinal barrier in newly hatched chickens. Increasing interest has been directed toward bacterial interactions within the mucus layer, and the mechanisms by which bacterial colonisation can influence mucus composition during early development. This is important, firstly, {{as a means to}} understand initiation of infection and secondly, to optimise the gut microflora for enhanced animal production. Currently, information on mucosal-bacterial interactions in poultry is limited. In order to observe the effects of bacterial exposure on intestinal goblet cell mucin production during early development, differences in the small intestine of conventionally-raised (CV) and low bacterial load (LBL) broiler chicks were examined during the first 7 days post-hatch. The initial aim {{of the study was to}} construct a small-scale, economical isolator system to hatch and raise chicks in a bacterial-free environment as a means to observe bacterial interactions with the intestinal mucosa in chickens exposed to normal environmental conditions. The design and construction of flexible plastic isolators for incubation and brooding are described, along with methodologies for preparation of eggs for entry into the isolators, incubation and hatching. Two trials were conducted, the first in August 2005 and the second in March 2006. It was found that the isolator system was successful in producing low bacterial load chicks for comparative studies with conventionally raised chicks, without compromising body weight. A histological study was then conducted whereby ileal and jejunal goblet cells were stained with either periodic acid-Schiff or high iron diamine/alcian blue pH 2. 5 to discriminate between neutral, sulphated and sialyated acidic mucins. Total goblet cell numbers and goblet cell and villous/crypt morphology were also examined. Bacterial colonisation of CV animals induced an increase in sialic acid moieties in both ileal and jejunal goblet cell such that initiation of these changes occurred at day 3 - 4 post-hatch. Differences in intestinal morphology were also consistent with other <b>germ-free</b> <b>animal</b> studies. In order to further understand the extent to which bacteria affected mucin composition, purified, isolated oligosaccharide fractions from ileal mucin at d 4 and 7 post-hatch were collected and analysed using mass spectrometry techniques to determine any structural differences in chain length or chain number between LBL and CV animals. No differences in chain length or number were observed between CV and LBL animals at either d 4 or 7 post-hatch with both groups equally displaying chain lengths of both low and high molecular weights. Although structural differences in mucin oligosaccharides were not observed between LBL and CV animals, bacterial binding assays utilising whole ileal sections were employed to determine whether or not the differences in mucin composition between LBL and CV animals during early development may have deterred or enhanced binding of certain bacterial species. Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus salivarius were selected for the experiment. Binding of L. salivarius to ileal sections was very low whereas E. coli binding was greater, and more pronounced in LBL animals, especially at d 7 post-hatch. No statistically significant differences were observed in binding of E. coli to purified ileal mucin from LBL and CV animals at either d 4 or d 7 post-hatch. Correlations between E. coli and L. salivarius adherence to ileal tissue and mucin samples, and goblet cell parameters, were not statistically significant when fitted as co-variates. It was concluded that the changes in mucin composition played a minor role in bacterial adhesion of L. salivarius and this E. coli serotype. In summary, this thesis explores the physiological changes in goblet cell mucin production in response to bacterial exposure post-hatch. The thesis outlines the complexity of mucosal-bacterial interactions which would benefit from the employment of specialised techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microarray technologies to examine a greater range of mucin structures and gene expression. This thesis provides support for future investigations into the influence of intestinal microflora on mucosal and mucin dynamics of poultry and the potential development of prebiotics for use in animal production.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our {{study was to identify}} a bacterial strain that is protective in murine allergy models and to determine if microbial induction of T regulatory cells was associated with protection from allergic inflammation. METHODS: Three microbes (Bifidobacterium breve AH 1205, B. longum AH 1206 and Lactobacillus salivarius AH 102) of human origin were fed to newborn, adult and <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals.</b> Induction of Foxp 3 (+) T regulatory cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Gene array analysis was performed on Peyer's patches. Strains were also examined for their protective effects in the ovalbumin (OVA) respiratory allergy model and the OVA-cholera toxin dietary allergy model. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium longum AH 1206 consumption resulted in increased numbers of Foxp 3 (+) T regulatory cells in infant, adult and <b>germ-free</b> <b>animals.</b> B. breve AH 1205 induced Foxp 3 (+) T regulatory cell expansion only in infant mice while L. salivarius AH 102 did not alter T regulatory cell numbers in any animal model tested. B. longum AH 1206 reduced the Peyer's patch gene expression associated with antigen presentation, TLR signalling and cytokine production while increasing the expression of genes associated with retinoic acid metabolism. B. longum AH 1206 protected against airway inflammation in OVA-sensitized animals and B. longum AH 1206 blocked the induction of IgE to orally administered OVA. Neither B. breve AH 1205 nor L. salivarius AH 102 had a protective effect in either model. CONCLUSION: Bacterial strain-specific induction of Foxp 3 (+) T regulatory cells in vivo is associated with protection from respiratory and oral allergy...|$|R
