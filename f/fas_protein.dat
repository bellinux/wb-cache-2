Here, we analyze meiosis in eight mouse models deficient for various DNA damage response (DDR) factors, including Fanconi anemia (<b>FA)</b> <b>proteins.</b> We reveal a network of FA and DDR <b>proteins</b> in which <b>FA</b> core factors FANCA, FANCB, and FANCC are essential for FANCD 2 foci formation, whereas BRCA 1 (FANCS), MDC 1, and RNF 8 are required for BRCA 2 (FANCD 1) and SLX 4 (FANCP) accumulation on the sex chromosomes during meiosis. In addition, <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> modulate distinct histone marks on the sex chromosomes: <b>FA</b> core <b>proteins</b> and FANCD 2 regulate H 3 K 9 methylation, while FANCD 2 and RNF 8 function together to regulate H 3 K 4 methylation independently of <b>FA</b> core <b>proteins.</b> Our data suggest that RNF 8 integrates the FA-BRCA pathway. Taken together, our study reveals distinct functions for <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> and illuminates the male sex chromosomes as a model to dissect {{the function of the}} FA-BRCA pathway...|$|R

To date sixteen FA genes have been identified, three of which predispose heterozygous mutation carriers to breast cancer.

Since not all FA patients {{can be linked to}} (one of) the sixteen known complementation groups, new FA genes remain to be identified. In addition the complex FA network remains to be further unravelled. One of the FA genes, FANCI, has been identified via a combination of bioinformatic techniques exploiting <b>FA</b> <b>protein</b> properties and genetic linkage. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a prioritization approach for proteins of the entire human proteome that potentially interact with the FA/BRCA pathway or are novel candidate FA genes. To this end, we combined the original bioinformatics approach based on the properties of the first thirteen <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> identified with publicly available tools for protein-protein interactions, literature mining (Nermal) and a protein function prediction tool (FuncNet).

A similar result also showed for cells transfected with the Fas-overexpressing plasmid. Immunoblots were performed and confirmed that survivin does not inhibit by mechanism of preventing Bax or <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> from being made into fully functional proteins.

Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> expression in 47. 6 % of the tumors; however, Fas-positive tumors demonstrated cytoplasmic staining without cell surface expression. Northern blot analysis indicated that levels of Fas mRNA were similar in Fas protein–positive tumors to levels in normal lung tissue, but were reduced in Fas protein–negative tumors.

Several lines of evidence support a critical role of the actin cytoskeleton in ciliogenesis and ciliary function.

FAK downregulation leads to ciliogenesis defects similar to those observed when the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted, including defects in basal body migration, docking, and spacing, suggesting that CAs link basal bodies to the actin cytoskeleton. The important role of <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> in ciliogenesis leads us to propose that evolutionarily <b>FA</b> <b>proteins,</b> many of which are found in primitive flagellated unicellular eukaryotes, may have originally evolved to perform functions at flagella and were later co-opted for use in cell adhesion...|$|R

Gene conversions occurring in mutant cells were associated with decreased nontemplated mutations. In contrast to these defects, we also found increased spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and intact Rad 51 foci formation after DNA damage. Thus, we propose that FancD 2 promotes a subpathway of HR that normally mediates gene conversion by a mechanism that avoids crossing over and hence SCEs...|$|R

Interestingly, one of the complexes, termed BRAFT, also contains five of the Fanconi anemia (<b>FA)</b> complementation group <b>proteins</b> (<b>FA</b> <b>proteins).</b> <b>FA</b> resembles BS in genomic instability and cancer predisposition, but most of its gene products have no known biochemical activity, and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood.

The complex also contains topoisomerase IIIalpha and replication protein A, proteins that are known to interact with BLM and could facilitate unwinding of DNA. We show that BLM complexes isolated from an FA cell line have a lower molecular mass. Our study provides the first biochemical characterization of a multiprotein FA complex and suggests {{a connection between the}} BLM and FA pathways of genomic maintenance.

40|$|The lymphoproliferation (lpr) {{mutation}} in the MRL strain of mice {{is caused by}} the insertion of the early transposable element ETn in the Fas gene. The insertion causes a striking decrease in Fas mRNA expression and is associated clinically with marked acceleration of the lupus-like disease. To further explore the role of the <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> in T-cell selection in the thymus and tolerance in the peripheral immune system, we produced a monospecific polyclonal anti-murine Fas antibody that binds to a polymorphic region of the protein. <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> expression was detected on approximately 90 % of BALB/c and MRL +/+ thymocytes, and the expression was highest on CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes, the stage at which most thymocytes die by apoptosis. In contrast to the high level of expression of Fas on thymocytes, Fas was detected on < 10 % of normal splenic T cells. After activation of splenic T cells with Con A or anti-CD 3 and interleukin 2, Fas expression increased approximately 10 -fold. Fas expression on splenic B cells was also markedly up-regulated after activation with lipopolysaccharide or anti-mu antibodies. The <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> was not detected on resting or activated lymphocytes obtained from MRL lpr/lpr mice. Together, these findings suggest that Fas plays a role in both thymic selection and T-cell survival in the periphery and that the accelerated autoimmunity in MRL lpr/lpr mice results from a defect in both of these pathways...|$|E
40|$|Human {{melanoma}} is {{the most}} aggressive form of skin cancer and is extremely resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. One of the critical parameters of this resistance is down-regulation of Fas (CD 95) cell-surface expression. Using TIG 3 normal human fibroblasts and human melanoma cell lines, we investigated transcriptional regulation of FAP- 1, a regulator of Fas translocation in the cell. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase FAP- 1 (PTPN 13, PTP-BAS) interacts with human <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> and prevents its export from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. In contrast, dynamin- 2 facilitates <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> translocation from the Golgi apparatus via the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. Suppression of dynamin functions by dominant negative dynamin K 44 A blocks Fas export, whereas the down-regulation of FAP- 1 expression by specific RNA interference restores Fas export (a phenomenon that could still be down-regulated {{in the presence of}} dominant-negative dynamin). Based on the FAP- 1 - and dynamin-dependent regulation of Fas translocation, we have created human melanoma lines with different levels of surface expression of Fas. Treatment of these melanoma lines with soluble Fas ligand resulted in programmed cell death that was proportional to the pre-existing levels of surface Fas. Taking into consideration the well known observations that FAP- 1 expression is often up-regulated in metastatic tumors, we have established a causal connection between high basal NF-κB transcription factor activity (which is a hallmark of many types of metastatic tumors) and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation of FAP- 1 gene expression that finally restricts <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> trafficking, thereby, facilitating the survival of cancer cells...|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{dystrophy}} is {{a pathological}} hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{that is not}} observed in other neurodegenerative disorders that lack amyloid deposition. Treatment of cortical neurons with fibrillar amyloid � (A�) peptides induces progressive neuritic dystrophy accompanied by a marked loss of synaptophysin immunoreactivity (Grace et al., 2002). Here, we report that fibrillar A�-induced neuronal dystrophy is mediated by the activation of focal adhesion (<b>FA)</b> <b>proteins</b> {{and the formation of}} aberrant FA structures adjacent to A� deposits. In the AD brain, activated <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> are observed associated with the majority of senile plaques. Clustered integrin receptors and activated paxillin (phosphorylated at Tyr- 31) and focal adhesion kinase (phosphorylated at Tyr- 297) are mainly detected in dystrophic neurites surrounding A � plaque cores, where they colocalize with hyperphosphorylated tau. Deletion experiments demonstrated that the presence of the LIM domains in the paxillin C terminus and the recruitment of the protein-Tyr phosphatase (PTP) -PEST to the FA complex are required for A�-induced neuronal dystrophy. Therefore, both paxillin and PTP-PEST appear to be critical elements in the generation of the dystrophic response. Paxillin is a scaffolding protein to which other <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> bind, leading to the formation of the FA contact and initiation of signaling cascades. PTP-PEST {{plays a key role in}} the dynamic regulation of focal adhesion contacts in response to extracellular cues.

To understand the function of <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> in cellular division events, we investigated the interaction between Stathmin- 1 (STMN 1) and the FA group C (FANCC) protein. STMN 1 is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein that regulates microtubule dynamics. STMN 1 activities are regulated through phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanisms that control assembly of the mitotic spindle, and dysregulation of STMN 1 phosphorylation is associated with mitotic aberrancies leading to chromosome instability and cancer progression. Using different biochemical approaches, we showed that FANCC interacts and co-localizes with STMN 1 at centrosomes during mitosis. We also showed that FANCC is required for STMN 1 phosphorylation, as mutations in FANCC reduced serine 16 - and 38 -phosphorylated forms of STMN 1. Phosphorylation of STMN 1 at serine 16 is likely an event dependent on a functional FA pathway, as it is reduced in FANCA- and FANCD 2 -mutant cells. Furthermore, FA-mutant cells exhibited mitotic spindle anomalies such as supernumerary centrosomes and shorter mitotic spindles.

There was a direct correlation among FAS transcript level, <b>FAS</b> <b>protein</b> level, and FAS-mediated apoptotic sensitivity in the CTCL samples. When the FAS-deficient cell lines were transfected with a wild-type FAS construct, FAS expression and sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis were restored. In aggregate, these findings provide evidence that like normal T cells, CTCL cells exhibit a mechanistic connection between transcriptional regulation of FAS and sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis, point to the development of FAS deficiency as one molecular mechanism responsible for acquired resistance to apoptosis in CTCL, and indicate that upregulation of FAS expression can restore sensitivity to apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Sertoli {{cells have}} long been {{considered}} {{to be involved in}} the regulation of the immune response in the testis. More recently, the Fas system has been implicated in the maintenance of the immune privilege in the testis as well as in the regulation of germ cell apoptosis. However, the control of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) expression in the testis remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that cultured mouse Sertoli cells constitutively express a low level of membrane-bound <b>Fas</b> <b>protein,</b> but not a soluble form of Fas. Sertoli cells stimulated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma markedly increase the expression of both soluble and membrane-bound Fas in a dose-dependent manner. The up-regulated membrane-bound <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> is functionally active because it induces a significant level of Sertoli cell death in the presence of Neuro- 2 a FasL+ effector cells. Interestingly, the soluble form of Fas, which is induced by the same cytokines but has an antiapoptotic effect, is also functional. In fact, conditioned media from TNF-alpha-stimulated Sertoli cell cultures inhibit Neuro- 2 a FasL+-induced cell death. Taken together, our data suggest a possible regulatory role of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on Fas-mediated apoptosis in the testis through disruption of the balance between different forms of Fas...|$|E
40|$|Mycosis fungoides (MF) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} manifestation of cutaneous T cell lymphoma but its cause and pathophysiology remain unclear. Because progression of lesions is characteristically slow, we hypothesized that mycosis fungoides originates from an accumulation of lymphocytes due to defective apoptosis of skin homing T lymphocytes. In this study, we investigate possible alterations of three molecules regulating apoptosis, i. e., Fas antigen, Bax, and p 53, at the genomic level in skin lesions from 44 patients with MF, as Fas mediates one of two major pathways for apoptosis of activated T cells. Fas mutations were found in six patients using a polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism method followed by cloning and sequencing of abnormal polymerase chain reaction products. The mutations predict for defective transmission of the death signal in three cases. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the lack of <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> expression on dermal lymphocytes in one case with Fas gene mutation predicting for a truncated death domain, whereas <b>Fas</b> <b>protein</b> was expressed by dermal lymphocytes in the other investigated cases. By contrast, no mutations of Bax or p 53 were found, whereas immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased p 53 expression in the nucleus of basal keratinocytes above the neoplastic infiltrate in some MF cases. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} Fas defects {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of MF...|$|E
40|$|Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genomic {{instability}} disorder {{characterized by}} bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. FA {{is caused by}} mutations {{in any one of}} several genes that encode proteins cooperating in a repair pathway and is required for cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. Recent studies suggest that the FA pathway may also play a role in mitosis, since FANCD 2 and FANCI, the 2 key <b>FA</b> <b>proteins,</b> are localized to the extremities of ultrafine DNA bridges (UFBs), which link sister chromatids during cell division. However, whether <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> regulate cell division remains unclear. Here we have shown that FA pathway–deficient cells display an increased number of UFBs compared with FA pathway–proficient cells. The UFBs were coated by BLM (the RecQ helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome) in early mitosis. In contrast, the <b>FA</b> <b>protein</b> FANCM was recruited to the UFBs at a later stage. The increased number of bridges in FA pathway–deficient cells correlated with a higher rate of cytokinesis failure resulting in binucleated cells. Binucleated cells were also detectable in primary murine FA pathway–deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells from human patients with FA. Based on these observations, we suggest that cytokinesis failure followed by apoptosis may contribute to bone marrow failure in patients with FA...|$|R
40|$|The Fanconi anemia (<b>FA)</b> pathway <b>proteins</b> {{are thought}} to be {{involved}} in the repair of irregular DNA structures including those encountered by the moving replication fork. However, the nature of the DNA structures that recruit and activate the <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> is not known. Because <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> function within an extended network of proteins, some of which are still unknown, we recently established cell-free assays in Xenopus laevis egg extracts to deconstruct the FA pathway in a fully replication-competent context. Here we show that the central <b>FA</b> pathway <b>protein,</b> xFANCD 2, is monoubiquitinated (xFANCD 2 -L) rapidly in the presence of linear and branched double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) structures but not single-stranded or Y-shaped DNA. xFANCD 2 -L associates with dsDNA structures in an FA core complex-dependent manner but independently of xATRIP, the regulatory subunit of xATR. Formation of xFANCD 2 -L is also triggered in response to circular dsDNA, suggesting that dsDNA ends are not required to trigger monoubiquitination of FANCD 2. The induction of xFANCD 2 -L in response to circular dsDNA is replication and checkpoint independent. Our results provide new evidence that the FA pathway discriminates among DNA structures and demonstrate that triggering the FA pathway can be uncoupled from DNA replication and ATRIP-dependent activation...|$|R
40|$|Mutations {{in one of}} {{at least}} eight {{different}} genes cause bone marrow failure, chromosome instability, and predisposition to cancer associated with the rare genetic syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). The cloning of seven genes has provided the tools to study the molecular pathway disrupted in Fanconi anemia patients. The structure of the genes and their gene products provided few clues to their functional role. We report here the use of 3 <b>FA</b> <b>proteins,</b> FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG, as "baits" {{in the hunt for}} interactors to obtain clues for <b>FA</b> <b>protein</b> functions. Using five different human cDNA libraries we screened 36. 5 x 10 (6) clones with the technique of the yeast two-hybrid system. We identified 69 proteins which have not previously been linked to the FA pathway as direct interactors of FANCA, FANCC, or FANCG. Most of these proteins are associated with four functional classes including transcription regulation (21 proteins), signaling (13 proteins), oxidative metabolism (10 proteins), and intracellular transport (11 proteins). Interaction with 6 proteins, DAXX, Ran, IkappaBgamma, USP 14, and the previously reported SNX 5 and FAZF, was additionally confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and/or colocalization studies. Taken together, our data strongly support the hypothesis that <b>FA</b> <b>proteins</b> are functionally involved in several complex cellular pathways including transcription regulation, cell signaling, oxidative metabolism, and cellular transport...|$|R
