5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|According to Safran Electronics & Defense, {{the weapon}} was {{launched}} {{at a range}} of more than 50km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> which was hit within one meter. A 125kg version was successfully test fired on January 27, 2009, and a laser guided variant was air-launched {{for the first time}} on June 17, 2010.|$|E
40|$|Is {{the effect}} of {{distractors}} in multiple object tracking dependent on the distractors sharing the features of <b>the</b> <b>targets?</b> In experiment 1, observers tracked five targets among five distractors that were identical to <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> {{and a number of}} additional distractors that were either identical to or featurally distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> Results showed that distractors that are distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> in shape or color, or are stationary, impair tracking less than distractors that are identical to <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> However, tracking performance declined as the number of distractors increased, even for featurally distinct distractors. Experiment 2 showed that distractors that differ <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> on two features impair tracking less than distractors that differ <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> on only one feature, but only when target tracking load is low. These results indicate that shape, color, and motion information about distractors can be used to distinguish them from targets during tracking, although even distractors with a different feature <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> produce some interference with tracking. These findings suggest that {{the effect of}} distractors on tracking is dependent on top – down settings for target features...|$|R
30|$|A 1 : In the {{measurement}} model in (3), {{it is assumed}} that <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> act as transmitters and each sensor will receive one reflection of <b>the</b> signal emitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> Signals emitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> propagate via free space, explaining the d_j,ρ^- 2 (t) attenuation coefficients, and are superimposed as shown in (3), see e.g., [29].|$|R

Petrol prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre, which is far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> price of approx. $0.90 per litre. As a consequence, fuel smuggling and gasoline imports increased again.|$|E
5|$|In sailing, it {{has long}} been known that if the bearing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E
5|$|Many {{accidents}} when driving personal {{vehicles are}} caused by distracted driving. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes. Specifically, passenger and cell phone interaction accounted for 27% of crashes, the leading cause. Drivers looking away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> (roadway) also accounted for 19%.|$|E

5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|Extensions to both Metro {{lines are}} planned as of September 2017. The Blue Line {{extension}} will branch northward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Field station, adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from Target Field station and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} for passenger service in 2021 and the Blue Line extension {{will be ready for}} passenger service the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack was}} {{to be part of}} a coordinated pincer {{movement}} against the airfields. Ju 88s from II./KG 76 were to dive-bomb buildings and hangars from high-altitude first. Five minutes later, 27 Do 17s from I. and II./KG 76 would level-bomb from high altitude to crater the runways and landing grounds while knocking out its defences. 9 Staffel KG 76, the specialist low-level strike unit, would go in and finish off any buildings still standing. It was a bold and imaginative plan. If it worked, it would wreck Kenley from end-to-end. The high-flying bombers would have full fighter escort but the low-flying bombers would have to use stealth to avoid interception to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> area. The operation began at 09:00 but was postponed because of heavy haze reducing visibility up to 4,000 feet.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Zveno-SPB saw limited but {{successful}} combat {{use during}} the German-Soviet War. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. The {{most important of these}} was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa oil pipeline. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and returned to the home airfield under their own power.|$|E

50|$|Some {{problems}} immediately recognized {{were that}} ground stations {{tended to be}} too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> ground and aircraft equipment was not maintained properly, few technicians knew {{how to work the}} equipment, and operators were too unfamiliar with Korean geography to use the system to the fullest extent.|$|R
5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E

25|$|The {{third stage}} is {{important}} to determine {{the quality of the}} deposited films. The high energetic species ablated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are bombarding the substrate surface and may cause damage to the surface by sputtering off atoms from the surface but also by causing defect formation in the deposited film. The sputtered species from the substrate and the particles emitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> form a collision region, which serves as a source for condensation of particles. When the condensation rate is high enough, a thermal equilibrium can be reached and the film grows on the substrate surface {{at the expense of the}} direct flow of ablation particles and the thermal equilibrium obtained.|$|E
25|$|Background {{pressure}} – Common in oxide deposition, {{an oxygen}} background {{is needed to}} ensure stoichiometric transfer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> to the film.
