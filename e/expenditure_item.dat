50|$|This {{approach}} is also called an acquisition cost model. This method measures the organization’s investment in employees using the five parameters: recruiting, acquisition, formal training and familiarization, informal training and informal familiarization, and experience and development.

The process of giving a status of asset to the <b>expenditure</b> <b>item</b> is called capitalization. In human resource management, it is necessary to amortize the capitalized amount over a period of time. So, here one will take the age of the employee at the time of recruitment and at the time of retirement.

30|$|Concerning {{the burden}} or {{redistribution}} effects of indirect taxes, {{there has been}} much study in the literature. The methods adopted by the author include micro simulation and general equilibrium analysis. Based on industry and household data, the micro simulation method is more suitable for figuring out the effects of the industry-related policy adjustments. In conducting research using this method, a key point is the estimation of the VAT and/or business tax included in the prices of the goods or services purchased by the households. Some studies directly take the statutory rates of VAT or business tax as the tax burden rates of the specific <b>expenditure</b> <b>items</b> of the households (Liu and Nie 2004; 2009), others determine the tax burden of the household <b>expenditure</b> <b>items</b> through measurement of the tax burden of various industries on the basis of input-output data and then match the industries in the input-output table with the household <b>expenditure</b> <b>items.</b> Considering the fact that China levies VAT or business tax on different goods or services, and the applicable rates and credit rules vary across different taxable items even within the VAT regime, the method based on input-output data can achieve more accurate results. However, in measuring the tax burden of each industry, earlier studies (Nie and Liu 2009; 2010; Tamaoka 1994) considered only the tax burden at the last stage in supplying the relevant goods and services and ignored the taxes included in the prices of the inputs and shifted finally to the households. More recent studies (Scutella 1999; Nie and Yue 2013) made important progress by including the input taxes in overall tax burden, but since the analysis is based on the data of collected tax revenue and leads to results reflecting the combined effects of tax system and tax administration, their method is still problematic for evaluating the effects of tax reform.|$|R

40|$|Background: In 2008, the Japanese {{government}} {{implemented a}} program of health lifestyle interventions to reduce health care expenditure. This study evaluated whether these interventions decreased health care expenditures. Methods: The study enrolled 99 participants insured by Japanese National Health Insurance, who, {{in our previous study}} conducted in 2004, were allocated by random sampling into an intervention group (50 participants) and a control group (49 participants). In the intervention group, we used a health support method that facilitated the attainment of goals established by each participant. The control group received instruction in exercise, as well as health support using publically available media. Although 3 participants in the intervention group and 9 participants in the control group did not participate in a follow-up health examination 1 year after the intervention, the health care expenditures of all initial participants were assessed. Expenditures before and after the intervention were compared within and between groups. Data on health care expenditures were obtained from inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and dental health insurance claims. Results: After the intervention, the pharmacy and dental expenditures were significantly higher in the intervention group, while the pharmacy expenditure was significantly higher in the control group.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for optimal medium-term scheduling (e. g. over a time window of 5 years) of rehabilitation and leakage detection interventions {{in a water}} distribution system given predetermined budget constraints. The decisional variables are the interventions to be scheduled, that is, which pipes to replace and when (in which year), and where and when (in which zone and year) to carry out leakage detection surveys, while the objectives are to minimize the volumes of water lost and break repair costs. The optimiser used is the NSGA II multiobjective genetic algorithm. It is assumed that the budget allocated for leakage detection and pipe rehabilitation (proactive interventions) re{{presents a}} separate <b>expenditure</b> <b>item</b> from that for the repair of breaks (reactive interventions). In particular, whereas repair costs are subject to minimization, the budget for proactive interventions is allocated on a yearly basis during the scheduling period and a constraint {{is determined by the}} fact that the amounts budgeted must be completely spent, year after year: this reflects the customary practice of Water Utilities, which strive to spend the entire budget available to them, since any residual amount may not be reallocated to the same <b>expenditure</b> <b>item</b> in the year or years to come. The multiobjective optimisation procedure does not produce one optimal solution, but rather the Pareto front of nondominated solutions. Some considerations for identifying a range of solutions within this front, from which to choose the one to apply, are thus discussed. The procedure is applied to a real water distribution system using advanced models to represent the various processes that characterise the problem, namely, leakages as a function of pipe age and pressure, actual nodal discharges released as a function of head, time series of pipe breaks, etc. and the results obtained show that the proposed procedure may be a useful decision support tool for scheduling leakage detection campaigns and rehabilitation interventions...|$|E

This paper, using data of two counties - Baranya and Békés - presents a cost-benefit calculation with respect to the operational costs of a hypothetical, newly structured primary education system, where only institutions of “optimal (efficient) size” are operated. Two scenarios are presented. According to the first one all schools of inefficient size would be closed down, while according to the second this could happen only if there is at least one additional social/cultural institution in the settlement in question. The results of the simulation, being rough calculations, may provide guidance on what kind of questions might occur and what the approximate magnitudes of expenditures of a new system might be under specific conditions of reorganisation...|$|E
