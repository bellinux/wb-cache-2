5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. <b>Each</b> <b>stage</b> is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 Giro d'Italia, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The {{first and most}} important is the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on <b>each</b> <b>stage.</b> Riders received time bonuses for finishing in the first three places on <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> (excluding the team time trial and individual time trial). The rider with the lowest cumulative time was awarded the pink jersey (the maglia rosa) and was considered the winner of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

30|$|How to {{calculate}} the motion equation of total population or labor population? Here, we follow Lu and Cai (2014)’s work and assume that fertility level is fully controlled by the fertility policy; under this condition, if we know policy fertility level for each period, and will also know initial population distribution and corresponding mortality at <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> we will also know future population distribution at <b>each</b> age <b>stage.</b> According to “ 2014 Chinese population and Employment Statistics Yearbook,” TFR is about 1.3 in 2013, that is TFR of maintaining the fertility policy unchanged, the policy TFR of universal two-child policy is about 2.0.We put population distribution in 2014 for different gender at <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> as an initial population distribution and put mortality between 2003 and 2013 for different gender at <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> as population update criteria. Firstly, we calculate population distribution for different gender at <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> we get {{the number of people}} at <b>each</b> age <b>stage</b> by the sum of the number of population for different gender for <b>each</b> age <b>stage,</b> and then we get the total population by adding the number of the population at each age group. Secondly, the number of newborn babies every year depends on the number of women of childbearing age (aged 15 – 49) and corresponding fertility level at <b>each</b> age <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Riders were {{required}} to sign in at checkpoints during <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> to minimize the opportunities for cheating; they were also photographed {{at the beginning and}} end of <b>each</b> <b>stage,</b> and the images compared by the judges. Riders could receive assistance when repairing their bicycles, but were not allowed to replace their machines if they became damaged during the course of the stage.|$|E
5|$|The final {{competition}} {{is the team}} classification. On <b>each</b> <b>stage,</b> each team is awarded a time based on the cumulative time of its top three riders. The times for <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> are then added together and {{the team with the}} lowest total time {{is the leader of the}} team classification. There is no jersey awarded for this classification.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, {{the times of}} the best three cyclists per team on <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> were added up; the leading team was {{the team with the}} lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20placed riders on <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.|$|E
50|$|The {{title was}} contested over a six round series with Rounds 1, 2 & 3 each run over two heats and Rounds 4, 5 & 6 <b>each</b> <b>staged</b> {{as a single}} race.|$|R
50|$|Clos {{networks}} {{are defined by}} three integers n, m, and r. n represents the number of sources which feed into each of r ingress <b>stage</b> crossbar switches. <b>Each</b> ingress <b>stage</b> crossbar switch has m outlets, and there are m middle stage crossbar switches. There is exactly one connection between <b>each</b> ingress <b>stage</b> switch and <b>each</b> middle <b>stage</b> switch. There are r egress <b>stage</b> switches, <b>each</b> with m inputs and n outputs. <b>Each</b> middle <b>stage</b> switch is connected exactly once to <b>each</b> egress <b>stage</b> switch. Thus, the ingress stage has r switches, {{each of which has}} n inputs and m outputs. The middle stage has m switches, each of which has r inputs and r outputs. The egress stage has r switches, each of which has m inputs and n outputs.|$|R
50|$|The {{participating}} {{teams are}} drawn into three groups; <b>each</b> <b>staging</b> a pairs competition. The top two teams {{in each group}} qualify for the Final. A host team chosen by the GKSŻ is seeded directly to the Final.|$|R
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during <b>each</b> <b>stage.</b> Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} a {{classification}} for teams. After <b>each</b> <b>stage,</b> the times {{of the first three}} riders on each team were added together. The team with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the team classification.|$|E
5|$|For each cyclist, {{the times}} they had needed in <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> was added {{up for the}} general classification. The cyclist with the least {{accumulated}} time after the last stage was the winner.|$|E

5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} {{room and a}} gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages. In <b>each</b> <b>stage,</b> players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden {{at the end of}} the stage, with more rooms becoming accessible as <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> is completed. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a flashlight and two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E
5|$|In some stages, Pepsiman's head becomes stuck {{inside a}} steel drum, which inverts the controls, and in some, {{he uses a}} skateboard. Throughout <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> is a number of checkpoints; if the player gets hit by {{obstacles}} too many times, they have to restart from the latest checkpoint. <b>Each</b> <b>stage</b> ends with Pepsiman being chased by an object, including a giant Pepsi can. In between stages, the player is shown videos of an American man drinking Pepsi and eating chips and pizza while watching television.|$|E

5|$|The Giro {{was one of}} 24events {{throughout}} the season that contributed points towards the 2009 UCI World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 20finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in <b>each</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The race {{included}} three individual classifications {{and a team}} classification. The {{most important of these}} was the general classification. This was calculated by adding up each cyclist's finishing times on <b>each</b> <b>stage.</b> Bonus seconds were awarded for top-three placings in <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> (10 seconds for the first rider, 6 seconds for the second, 4 seconds for the third) and for placings in intermediate sprints (3 seconds for the first rider, 2 seconds for the second, 1 second for the third). The rider with the lowest cumulative time after taking bonus seconds into account was the leader of the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey. (Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire.) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E

30|$|To {{assess the}} {{residence}} time (based on Kruys et al. 2002), in total and for <b>each</b> decay <b>stage,</b> the average dry density (g[*]·[*]cm− 3) {{and the average}} decomposition time (years) per decay stage were calculated from the whole dataset in a first step. For further calculations, <b>each</b> decay <b>stage</b> {{was defined as the}} interval between the midpoints of dry densities of decay classes (e.g., 0.5 – 1.49 for decay stage 1). Afterwards a dry density value was assigned for <b>each</b> decay <b>stage</b> interval based on the exponential relationship between decay stage and average dry density. In the same way, the decomposition time was assigned, which was calculated based on the exponential relationship between average dry density and average decomposition time. Finally the residence time per decay stage was defined as the decomposition time at the upper bound of <b>each</b> decay <b>stage.</b>|$|R
50|$|New World Stages houses five theaters. Stages 1 and 3 have {{a maximum}} of 499 seats <b>each,</b> <b>Stages</b> 2 and 4 have {{a maximum of}} 350 seats <b>each,</b> and <b>Stage</b> 5 has a maximum of 199 seats. These capacities, greater than 100, fewer than 500, define New World Stages as an Off-Broadway complex. (Theaters with fewer than 100 seats are Off-Off-Broadway; theaters with 500 or more seats {{that are in the}} theater {{district}} fall into the Broadway level.) The maximum weekly capacity, assuming five shows running concurrently in the five theaters, each for eight performances per week, is 15,176 people.|$|R
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen places on <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> and {{in the top three}} at each intermediate sprint. The first rider at <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth. At the intermediate sprints, the first three riders won 4, 2 and 1 points respectively. The rider with the most points won the classification and wore a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|The third jersey {{represented}} the points classification, {{marked by a}} white-and-red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing highly in a stage. A stage victory awarded 10 points, with 8 points for second, 6 for third, 4 for fourth and 2 for fifth. Points could also be earned at intermediate sprints location for finishing {{in the top three}} during <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> on a 6–3–1 scale. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on <b>each</b> <b>stage</b> were added together; the leading team {{at the end of the}} race was the team with the lowest total time.|$|E
