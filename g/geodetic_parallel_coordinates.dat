40|$|Typical {{scientific}} data is represented on a grid with appropriate interpolation or approximation schemes, defined on a continuous domain. The visualization of such data in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> may reveal patterns latently {{contained in the}} data and thus can improve the understanding of multidimensional relations. In this paper, we adopt the concept of continuous scatterplots for the visualization of spatially continuous input data to derive a density model for <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Based on the point–line duality between scatterplots and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates,</b> we propose a mathematical model that maps density from a continuous scatterplot to <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> and present different algorithms for both numerical and analytical computation of the resulting density field. In addition, we show how the 2 -D model {{can be used to}} successively construct continuous <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> with an arbitrary number of dimensions. Since continuous <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> interpolate data values within grid cells, a scalable and dense visualization is achieved, which will be demonstrated for typical multi-variate {{scientific data}}...|$|R

They also identify user tasks that can be effectively solved if <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> dynamically linked to polyline glyphs are used. This study adds to the body of previous work a discussion on the features of the polyline glyphs that facilitate the exploration and understanding of multivariate data. Moreover, the authors conduct an empirical study in which <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> dynamically linked to polyline glyphs are used to solve four tasks. The main finding is that polyline glyphs can facilitate a better insight into the similarities between the multivariate signatures of data items and information acquisition if visual clutter hinders the use of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The study also reveals that if visual clutter does not occur in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> and the polylines from the latter can be differentiated, individuals tend not to use polyline glyphs to study multivariate signatures...|$|R

40|$|Multivariate {{data sets}} {{exist in a}} wide variety of fields and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{visualizations}} are commonly used for analysing such data. This paper presents a usability evaluation where we compare three types of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> visualization for exploratory analysis of multivariate data. We use a standard <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> display with manual permutation of axes, a standard <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> display with automatic permutation of axes, and a multi-relational 3 D <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> display with manual permutation of axes. We investigate whether a 3 D layout showing more relations simultaneously, but distorted by perspective effects, is advantageous when compared with a standard 2 D layout. The evaluation is accomplished by means of an experiment comparing performance differences for a class of task known to be well-supported by <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Two levels of difficulty of the task are used and both require the user to find relationships between variables in a multivariate data set. Our results show that for the manual exploration of a complex interrelated multivariate data set, the user performance with multi-relational 3 D <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> is significantly faster. In simpler tasks, however, the difference is negligible. The study adds to the body of work examining the utility of 3 D representations and what properties of structure in 3 D space can be successfully used in 3 D representations of multivariate data...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious environmental threats today. The analysis of its causes is an important research topic and visualization tools serve as the key component in weather data analysis. The goal of this thesis is to build a comprehensive <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> visualization system for air pollution analysis. <b>Parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> is a fundamental visualization technique in information visualization. In this thesis, three major issues of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> are addressed: visual clutter, dimension ordering and problematic transition. In the proposed system, a novel geometry-based clustering algorithm is proposed to reduce clutter in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Three graph-based analytic tools are developed on the <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> A selection graph provides an interface for users to select regions of interest in a cluttered display. A relation graph organizes clusters structurally which is an informative way for users to study inter-cluster relationships. A weighted complete graph aids users to find the optimal axis order based on its structure. The problematic transition is alleviated by the proposed non-linear growth technique and morphing transition on common operations in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> An analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system using real Hong Kong weather data...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{task performance}} and reading characteristics for scatterplots (Cartesian <b>coordinates)</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> In a controlled eye-tracking study, we asked 24 participants {{to assess the}} relative distance of points in multidimensional space, depending on the diagram type (<b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> or a horizontal collection of scatterplots), the number of data dimensions (2, 4, 6, or 8), and the relative distance between points (15 %, 20 %, or 25 %). For a given reference point and two target points, we instructed participants to choose the target point that was closer to the reference point in multidimensional space. We present a visual scanning model that describes different strategies to solve this retrieval task for both diagram types, and propose corresponding hypotheses that we test using task completion time, accuracy, and gaze positions as dependent variables. Our results show that scatterplots outperform <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> significantly in 2  dimensions, however, the task was solved more quickly and more accurately with <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> in 8  dimensions. The eye-tracking data further shows significant differences between Cartesian and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates,</b> {{as well as between}} different numbers of dimensions. For <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates,</b> there is a clear trend toward shorter fixations and longer saccades with increasing number of dimensions. Using an area-of-interest (AOI) based approach, we identify different reading strategies for each diagram type: For <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates,</b> the participants’ gaze frequently jumped back and forth between pairs of axes, while axes were rarely focused on when viewing Cartesian coordinates. We further found that participants’ attention is biased: {{toward the center of the}} whole plotfor <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> and skewed to the center/left side for Cartesian coordinates.

Due to their size and complexity it is intrinsically hard to form a global overview and understanding of them. Information visualization aims at overcoming these difficulties by transforming data into representations that can be more easily interpreted. This thesis presents work on the development of methods to enable efficient information visualization of multivariate and time-varying data sets by conveying information in a clear and interpretable way, and in a reasonable time. The work presented is primarily based on a popular multivariate visualization technique called <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> but many of the methods can be generalized to apply to other information visualization techniques. A three-dimensional, multi-relational version of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> is presented that enables a simultaneous analysis of all pairwise relationships between a single focus variable and all other variables included in the display. This approach permits a more rapid analysis of highly multivariate data sets. Through a number of user studies the multi-relational <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> technique has been evaluated against standard, two-dimensional <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> and been found to better support a number of different types of task. High precision density maps and transfer functions are presented as a means to reveal structure in large data displayed in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> These two approaches make it possible to interactively analyse arbitrary regions in a <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> display without risking the loss of significant structure.
