5|$|In the movie, Greene kills Shondor Birns by detonating a bomb on his car. In reality, {{even though}} Birns {{was killed by}} a car bomb, there was no {{evidence}} to link Greene to his murder. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> commonly speculated that Greene killed Birns, his murder remains officially unsolved.|$|E

A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab diaspora in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.|$|E

5|$|Harry Woolman {{worked on}} the special effects along with Baker, and Willy Curtis worked as the film's cinematographer. Some scenes {{included}} photography errors, including one in which light shines through a kitchen window from outside <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be nighttime. Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober.|$|E
5|$|It is an energetic, free-spirited breed. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a gundog, it is {{also kept}} as a {{companion}} dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion to the cause. It is a cheerful, active dog and is always ready to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata {{deficient}} on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> widespread species, very little is known about its status and ecology. The current state of its population trend is unclear. There are no known threats to the species. It occurs in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park and the Gambela National Park. It has also been found in the Baroye Controlled Hunting Area.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that some divers can manage better than others because of learning {{to cope with the}} subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E

5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E
5|$|Greater London {{is split}} by the River Thames. The London region has a {{population}} of 7,512,400 within an area of 1,579km2, making it the second-largest populated region in the United Kingdom. However, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one of the largest urban conglomerations in Europe, almost two-thirds of London is made up of greenspace and wetlands, consisting primarily of extensive areas of green belt, large parks and the Thames basin. As of January 2016, there are 37 sites designated within this Area of Search, 30 of which have been designated for their biological interest and 7 for their geological interest.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, New York State Assembly member Vincent Ignizio {{suggested}} that New York should adopt a dog {{as a state}} symbol, and during the campaign to name the western painted turtle as state reptile for Colorado in 2008, it was suggested by local press that the Labrador Retriever would be suitable as a symbol, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not native to the state. While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the Cairn Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film The Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Representative Ed Trimmer tabled a bill proposing the Cairn Terrier as a state symbol.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic (c. 600 c. 900), {{alliance}} with Calakmul frequently {{was associated with}} the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E
5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inevitable. At the same time, {{he considers the}} separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues {{that this is not}} because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> part of the main route.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades in the Holy Land are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72. This convention {{is used by}} Charles Mills in his History of the Crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land (1820), and is often retained for convenience <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> somewhat arbitrary. The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E
5|$|The second {{presentation}} {{was given by}} a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm, who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions, to counter the increasing dangers of global warming. He {{went on to say}} that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a windier country, and that North West England has a particularly poor record, with only 1.3% of electricity generated from renewable energy. Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E
