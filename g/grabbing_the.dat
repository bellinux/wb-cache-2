5|$|When the Realtors {{took the}} first overall draft right in 2006, they did not {{hesitate}} to pick Kelly Williams over two-time UAAP MVP Arwind Santos, who was later picked second overall by the Air21 Express.

Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E

The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about <b>grabbing</b> <b>the</b> gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E

He scored his first league goal of the season on 22 September, in a 4–1 defeat away to Southampton. Bent then lost his starting place for the next league match against West Bromwich Albion, after the performances of Gabby Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke during the midweek League Cup victory over Manchester City saw the pair start up front.

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by <b>grabbing</b> <b>the</b> gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying.

The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the ladder match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on the ladder, Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the ladder in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the ladder over.
