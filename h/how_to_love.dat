In Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics (1996), George Reisman attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both Classical and Austrian economics. In psychology, Professor Edwin A. Locke and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in The Selfish Path to Romance: <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Love</b> with Passion & Reason.

500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet until we know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> the people that are around us".|$|E
500|$|Wilde left Portora with a royal {{scholarship}} to read classics at Trinity College, Dublin, from 1871 to 1874, sharing rooms with {{his older brother}} Willie Wilde. Trinity, {{one of the leading}} classical schools, placed him with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell, Arthur Palmer, Edward Dowden and his tutor, J. P. Mahaffy who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book Social Life in Greece. Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy [...] "my first and best teacher" [...] and [...] "the scholar who showed me <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> Greek things". For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he named him [...] "the only blot on my tutorship".|$|E
500|$|In the {{animated}} film, the Beast barely sings because Menken and original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman {{had not been}} able to determine a moment within the film during which it would have been suitable for the character to perform his own song. Initially, Menken had especially wanted the Beast to perform [...] "If I Can't Love Her", a song he and Rice had written for the character to sing in stage adaptation of {{the animated}} film, in the remake, but ultimately decided that an entirely new song that establishes that the Beast has finally learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> would be more appropriate due to the film's three-act structure. Musically, [...] "Evermore" [...] bears a resemblance to songs from the stage musicals Les Misérables (1980) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986), as well as some of Menken's own earlier compositions, specifically selections from Disney's animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).|$|E

500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> me when you're sober".|$|E

On the surface she’s sexy, stylish, clever, and together but below the surface, Ridge and Taylor's only surviving daughter is emotionally starved and slowly learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> and be loved". By 2011, Wood described Steffy as a [...] "rich bitch" [...] and stated, [...] "I love playing her and developing her character. She is so different from me. It's rather cathartic, and it allows my alter ego {{to come out on}} The Bold and The Beautiful set five days a week." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth characterized Steffy as {{the soap opera}}'s [...] "resident diva". When asked if Steffy was [...] "a little bit nuts", Wood said: [...] "yes, she's a mess.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E

500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In the United States, [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] was {{serviced}} {{to radio}} on October 9, 1996.

500|$|Rob Markman of MTV News {{wrote that}} the singers [...] "display good {{chemistry}} on the song". The Washington Posts Sarah Godfrey classified [...] "Love a Woman" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album adding that [...] "The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> a woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B is all you need to help you maintain a loving relationship with your partner." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo!
