40|$|A {{collective}} {{is a set}} of self-interested agents which try {{to maximize}} their own utilities, along with a a well-defined, time-extended world utility function which rates the performance of the entire system. In this paper, we use theory of collectives to design time-extended payoff utilities for agents that are both “aligned ” with the world utility, and are “learnable”, Le., the agents can readily see how their behavior affects their utility. We show that in systems where each agent aims to optimize such payoff functions, coordination arises as a byproduct of the agents selfishly pursuing their own goals. A game theoretic analysis shows that such payoff functions have the net effect of aligning the Nash equilibrium, Pareto opcimal solution and world utility optimum, thus eliminating undesirable behavior such as agents working at cross-purposes. We then apply collective-based payoff functions to the token collection in a gridworld problem where agents need to optimize the aggregate value of tokens collected across an episode of finite duration (i. e., an abstracted version of rovers on Mars collecting scientif-ically “interesting ” rock samples, subject to power limitations). We show that, regardless of the initial token <b>distribution,</b> <b>reinforcement</b> learning agents using collective-based payoff functions significantly outperform both “natural ” extensions of single agent algorithms an...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExpanded clay {{concrete}} {{differs from}} heavy-weight concrete {{not only by}} the composition and performance properties, but also by modes of chemical interactions between the components. So, not the primary problem of reinforcement corrosion in heavy-weight concrete under the normal conditions and the correct protective layer, becomes in the major problem in expanded clay concrete. The issue of reinforcement corrosion in expanded clay concrete is considered in this article. The studies on the effect of different compositions on the corrosiveness were conducted. Researchers have proposed various options for expanded clay concrete reinforcement protection from the environmental impact, including those through a variety of chemically active additives. According to the data obtained by experimenting, the diagrams of corroded area size dependence on various factors were presented. The results of the studies conducted are the recommended design and technological measures for the reinforcement protection against corrosion in various fine aggregate-based (natural sand, ash and dry hydroremoval) light-weight expanded clay concrete. Thus, the minimum concrete protective cover for main and <b>distribution</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of external walls must be at least 25 mm. It is necessary to inject additives – reinforcement corrosion inhibitors (sodium nitrite, sodium tetraborate) to the concrete composition. The consumption of cement, and hence, the cement paste content of concrete mixture must be not lower than 220 kg/m 3, and under the application of the active dry fly ash removal − 200 kg/m 3...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years the global need for reduced weight, low cost, high wear {{resistance}} and good quality materials has caused a shift in research from monolithic to composite materials. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) have evoked a keen interest in recent times for potential applications in marine, aerospace and automotive industries owing to their superior strength to weight ratio and high temperature resistance. Driving force for the utilization of AMCs include performance, economic and environmental benefits. The widespread adoption of particulate metal matrix composites for engineering applications has been hindered by the high cost of producing components. Achieving a uniform <b>distribution</b> of <b>reinforcement</b> within the matrix is one such challenge which impacts directly on the properties and quality of the composite material. In the case of particle reinforced metal matrix composites, the <b>distribution</b> of the <b>reinforcement</b> particles in the matrix alloy is influenced by several factors during casting.

40|$|Although {{concurrent}} schedules may arrange reinforcers irregularly, {{relatively large}} numbers of reinforcers are obtained when an animal changes from one schedule to the other. This paper proposes a quantitative relation that predicts the proportion of reinforcers obtained when an animal {{is working on a}} schedule and the proportion when the animal changes over to a schedule. Basically the relation states that the number of reinforcers obtained while an animal works on a schedule varies directly with the relative amount of time spent working on that schedule; and the number of reinforcers obtained when an animal changes to a schedule varies directly with the relative amount of time spent on the alternate schedule. An important aspect of this relation is that when relative reinforcement rates are less than. 50, more reinforcers are obtained just after an animal changes to a schedule than at all other times when this schedule is engaged. Data obtained both from a stat-bird and a live pigeon were in close agreement with the quantitative predictions. The relation between changing over and reinforcement held across several procedural changes that included changes in relative reinforcement rate, changes from independent to interdependent scheduling procedures, and changes in the variable-interval <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distributions.</b> The results are discussed in terms {{of the effects of the}} local <b>distribution</b> of <b>reinforcement</b> on responding.
