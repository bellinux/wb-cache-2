30|$|This paper {{presents}} a system-wide cost optimization approach {{to minimize the}} operational cost of open-cast mining operations by analyzing the relationship among the mining subsystems including drilling, blasting, <b>loading,</b> <b>hauling</b> and crushing. The particle size of the blasted muck pile is the common cost parameter for all activities. Thus, the cost calculations {{are based on the}} mean fragmentation size which is decided by the blast design parameters such as burden, spacing, sub-drill, the explosive charge, etc. Lowering the particle size causes an increase in the drilling and blasting costs. On the other hand, it provides more efficient <b>loading,</b> <b>hauling</b> and crushing till a certain size. Mean particle size affects the <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> by the fill factor. Moreover, the energy requirement of the crushers {{is directly related to the}} crusher feed size. When these relations between the mean fragmentation size and the cost of mining activities are considered, optimizing the mean fragmentation size can provide substantial cost savings in mining operations.|$|R

40|$|In rail {{operation}} (with traffic {{corresponding to}} passed tonnage of <b>gross</b> <b>loads</b> of 500 and 1000 million t), the surface {{layer of the}} steel is significantly strengthened. Electron-microscope data permit quantitative analysis of the contribution of different mechanisms to rail strengthening in prolonged operation, at different distances from the contact surface. The strengthening is multifactorial: it involves substructural strengthening associated with nanofragment formation; dispersional strengthening by carbide particles; the formation of atmospheres at dislocations; and polar stress due to interphase and intraphase boundaries. The {{significant increase in the}} surface strength of rail steel after prolonged operation (passed tonnage of <b>gross</b> <b>loads</b> of 1000 million t) is due to the presence of long-range internal stress fields and to the fragmentation of material with the formation of nanostructure...|$|R

40|$|A limited {{investigation}} of a 1 / 24 -scale dynamically similar model of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics DR- 77 design was conducted in Langley tank no. 2 to determine the calm-water take-off and the rough-water landing characteristics of the design with particular regard to the take-off resistance and the landing accelerations. During the take-off tests, resistance, trim, and rise were measured and photographs were taken to study spray. During the landing tests, motion-picture records and normal-acceleration records were obtained. A ratio of <b>gross</b> <b>load</b> to maximum resistance of 3. 2 was obtained with a 30 deg. dead-rise hydro-ski installation.

40|$|Principles for {{designing}} the optimum hull {{for a large}} long-range flying boat {{to meet the requirements}} of seaworthiness, minimum drag, and ability to take off and land at all operational <b>gross</b> <b>loads</b> were incorporated in a 1 / 12 -size powered dynamic model of a four-engine transport flying boat having a design <b>gross</b> <b>load</b> of 165, 000 pounds. These design principles included the selection of a moderate beam loading, ample forebody length, sufficient depth of step, and close adherence to the form of a streamline body. The aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the model were investigated in Langley tank no. 1. Tests were made to determine the minimum allowable depth of step for adequate landing stability, the suitability of the fore-and-aft location of the step, the take-off performance, the spray characteristics, and the effects of simple spray-control devices. The application of the design criterions used and test results should be useful in the preliminary design of similar large flying boats...|$|R

40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) {{vehicles}} {{are used in}} underground mines to load and transport ore and minerals. They can be manually or automatically operated. With an automatic system, the operator can {{be taken out of}} the mine and simultaneously control up to three LHDs, thus increasing both productivity and security for the personnel. There are a number of operation modes available for <b>Load</b> <b>Haul</b> Dump (LHD) vehicles and there are many criteria to consider when choosing the best one. This report fills a gap in the literature by mapping and describing the experiences and present status of the operation and maintenance of both automatic and manual LHDs as well as the existing navigation systems and techniques associated with underground automated loading and transportation. The commercially systems available today for automation of LHDs are supplied by Sandvik, Caterpillar and Atlas Copco. Automation focus have over the years gradually shifted from having fully automated fleets of vehicles to more flexible solutions with semi-automatic LHDs gaining safety as one of the main goals. Several issues must be resolved to maximize the benefits of automation. One is to improve maintenance, as this is crucial for an operation to work smoothly without the waste incurred by unplanned breakdowns. Godkänd; 2011; 20110913 (anngus...|$|R

40|$|The {{logging system}} {{consists}} of five subsystems; namely, felling, bucking, skidding, <b>loading,</b> and <b>hauling.</b> Productivity of the felling and bucking subsystems depends largely upon {{the skill of}} the men doing the work and can be subjected to a minimum amount of analysis. Skidding represents a materials handling system that is being subjected to {{a great deal of}} technical analysis. <b>Loading</b> and <b>hauling,</b> however, stand in need of investigation. Both are materials handling systems that need analysis of the best equipment for a particular situation. This thesis presents a simulation model that investigates the many variable combinations existing in the <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> subsystems. Development of the model required two steps: (1) identi- fication of the events and activities common to <b>loading</b> and <b>hauling</b> subsystems and (2) definition of owning and operating costs relevant to the two sub-systems. Calculation of relevant costs resulted in the criteria used to compare the numerous variable combinations. The criteria is a ratio of investment to output expressed in dollars per thousand board feet of merchantable timber. Identification of appropriate events and activities allowed use of the simulation language, GASP II, in testing various alternatives. The result of this investigation is a fully developed model capable of testing alternatives of the many logging situations in existence.

Long hole stoping is a highly selective and productive method of mining and can cater for varying ore thicknesses and dips (0 - 90 degree). It differs from manual methods such as timbered and shrinkage as once the stope has begun blasting phase it cannot be accessed by personnel.
