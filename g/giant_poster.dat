500|$|Many {{organizations}} and {{groups in the}} Armenian diaspora are named after Andranik. On 11 September 2012, during the Bulgaria vs. Armenia football match in Sofia's Levski National Stadium, Armenian fans brought a <b>giant</b> <b>poster</b> with pictures of General Andranik and Armenian officer Gurgen Margaryan, who was murdered in 2004 by Azeri lieutenant Ramil Safarov. The text on the poster read, [...] "Andranik's children are also heroes... The work will be done".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the tale's development, Warne {{proposed}} launching Mr. Tod as the first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines. Potter objected. She did not want to become involved in a new series; her eyesight was failing, and she had grown weary of writing. She complained of having difficulty in producing [...] "fresh short stories", and believed children preferred little change in the books. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod, and the next book, The Tale of Pigling Bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as [...] "Series II, New Style". Potter disliked the new endpaper depicting Samuel Whiskers sticking up a <b>giant</b> <b>poster</b> while watched by other animal characters, thinking it too like a railway advertisement. Eventually, the larger format and new designation were dropped, and the ordinary binding adopted for reprints.|$|E

500|$|According to Wiesenthal, on 20 April 1943, Second Lieutenant Gustav Wilhaus, {{second in}} command at the Janowska camp, decided to shoot 54 Jewish intellectuals in celebration of Hitler's 54th birthday. Unable to find enough such people still alive at Janowska, Wilhaus ordered a roundup of prisoners from the {{satellite}} camps. Wiesenthal and two other inmates {{were taken from the}} Eastern Railway camp to the execution site, a trench [...] deep and [...] long at a nearby sandpit. The men were stripped and led through [...] "the Hose", a six- or seven-foot wide barbed wire corridor to the execution ground. The victims were shot and their bodies allowed to fall into the pit. Wiesenthal, waiting to be shot, heard someone called out his name. He was returned alive to the camp; Kohlrautz had convinced his superiors that Wiesenthal was the best man available to paint a <b>giant</b> <b>poster</b> in honour of Hitler's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Many {{political}} {{films are}} also referenced. The episode features several {{references to the}} film All the President's Men, which chronicled Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's investigation of the Watergate scandal. These include the pull-out of Lisa looking over the voting records, the music, and the clandestine meeting with Smithers in a parking garage. The end court scene, as well as Sideshow Bob's speech, echo the 1992 film A Few Good Men, including Jack Nicholson's speech with the line [...] "You can't handle the truth". Bob's sudden confession that he did rig the election was a vague reference to [...] "every episode of Perry Mason". Sideshow Bob gives his acceptance speech underneath a <b>giant</b> <b>poster</b> {{with a picture of}} himself on it; this is a reference to the campaign speech scene in Citizen Kane. The title of the episode and several plot elements, including Bob entering Burns' meeting draped in an American flag, are references to the 1992 film Bob Roberts.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the episode}} comes from the slogan in a {{political}} advert used in Herbert Hoover's presidential campaign in 1928, [...] "A Chicken In Every Pot", which the advert later amplifies with [...] "And a car in every backyard, to boot.". Several parts of the episode are inspired by the 1941 film Citizen Kane, all with Mr. Burns {{in the role of}} Charles Foster Kane. The campaign rally scene where Burns speaks in front of a <b>giant</b> <b>poster</b> of himself is a reference to a scene from that film. The scene where Burns trashes the Simpson family's dining room after the dinner is similar to the scene in which Kane destroys his ex-wife's room. Mary Bailey shares her name with George Bailey's wife in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. Burns hires an actor to portray the nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin [...] to help in his claim that the three-eyed fish was the result of evolution. Darwin was a naturalist who presented compelling evidence that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors, through the process he called natural selection. The clip of Burns driving a military tank in his campaign montage is similar to a clip featured in Michael Dukakis's 1988 United States presidential campaign, in which he can be seen driving a tank. A re-run of the episode that aired on June 25, 1992, included a new chalkboard gag in the opening credits that featured Bart writing [...] "It's potato, not potatoe" [...] on the chalkboard. This is a reference to a spelling blunder by the then-Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle, who corrected a student's correct spelling of [...] "potato" [...] to [...] "potatoe" [...] at an elementary school spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey, on June 15, 1992.|$|E
