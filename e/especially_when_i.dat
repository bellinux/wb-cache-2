500|$|Davies {{gave his}} maiden {{speech in the}} House of Commons on 21 June 1934. Breaking with the {{tradition}} that such speeches should be non-partisan, he delivered a fierce attack on the government's policy towards the mining industry. He had come, he said, from a coalfield that [...] "has had very little help from the present government... we see communities with a great industrial history dissolving and disintegrating". An uncompromising approach on any questions affecting Merthyr Tydfil, or the mining industry generally, became Davies's parliamentary hallmark. In December 1934 he rebuked the veteran Conservative MP Nancy Astor when she referred to Merthyr as having [...] "no social consciousness or initiative to do anything". Davies replied: [...] "I object to irresponsible and brutal charges coming from people whose knowledge {{is derived from the}} enjoyment of vast wealth, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am not certain that they have made their contribution towards producing that wealth".|$|E

[...] "Hearing the Spanish guitar in the car was that moment for me because the sound takes you away to an exotic place, {{and it was a}} perfect fit, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in this crossroads of my life." [...] He got a nylon string guitar and started relearning the instrument. Benise retired his electric guitar to focus exclusively on his new instrument. [...] He meshed his rock background and the Spanish guitar in a combination he calls [...] "rockmenco", [...] pouring out [...] "intoxicating" [...] Spanish flamenco-inspired guitar riffs with the intensity of a rock player.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{became a}} blues standard, and {{renditions}} {{have been performed}} and recorded by numerous artists. [...] Some follow the original arrangement, while others interpret it differently. As early as 1946, a young Ray Charles played it regularly. He recalled, [...] "Charles Brown was a powerful influence on me {{in the early part}} of my career, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was struggling down in Florida. I made many a dollar doing my imitation of his 'Drifting Blues'. That was a hell of a number". [...] In 1950, Lightnin' Hopkins recorded a different arrangement of the song, accompanied only by his amplified guitar John Lee Hooker recorded a similar adaptation in 1961. Billy Eckstine recorded it in 1959 for the album Basie/Eckstine Incorporated. Chuck Berry recorded his interpretation for his 1960 album Rockin' at the Hops.|$|E

I physically can’t keep up with it (the volume of mail), <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go away," [...] she said in emphasis of {{a recent trip to}} London she had made. In addition to helping with fundraisers, Sosnovska was outspoken about gay marriage. [...] "I've been listening to the debate about gay marriage, she said. [...] "It’s very difficult to wrap my head around people who oppose such a basic right. There’s no logic behind any of these reasons [...] [...] have no idea about the fact that they’re talking about normal people." [...] In this respect, Sosnovska hoped her role as Lena had helped, if even a little, since [...] "the more human faces you can put to this story, the better".|$|E

Along with co-hosts Jaya, Rachelle Ann Go, Kyla and Jonalyn Viray, Velasquez did an impromptu/unrehearsed performance to give tribute {{to one of}} their biggest music influences, American singer Whitney Houston who died hours before the show started. Velasquez sang a medley of Houston's hits such as [...] "All the Man That I Need", [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] and [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] together with other singer. Prior to her performance, Velasquez talked about how Houston influenced her, [...] "The songs of this diva shaped and inspired the singer that I am today, to commemorate her, this is my tribute to Whitney Houston" ...

[...] "We lived together, we was in the streets hustling together. I had got involved with my older son's mom at the time. I moved out of the apartment into my own spot with her.
