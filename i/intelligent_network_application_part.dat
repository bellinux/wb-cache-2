These are realized using <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part</b> (INAP) that sits above Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) on the SS7 protocol stack.

50|$|The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a {{signalling}} protocol {{used in the}} Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a Remote Operations Service Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered {{on top of the}} Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS#7 protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are generally classed under the heading of (<b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part)</b> or INAP CS-2 protocol.|$|E
50|$|The SS7 {{protocol}} stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital {{protocol stack}}. OSI layers 1 to 3 {{are provided by}} the Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together {{referred to as the}} Network Service Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP, Telephone User Part (TUP), or the ISDN User Part (ISUP), the User Part provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6. The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users), such as the Mobile Application Part, the <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part</b> and the CAMEL Application Part.|$|E
50|$|The Message Transfer Part (MTP) {{covers a}} portion of the {{functions}} of the OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer, message handling and routing to the higher levels. Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) is at functional Level 4. Together with MTP Level 3 it is called the Network Service Part (NSP). SCCP completes the functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing, connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the Network Service Part (NSP). Telephone User Part (TUP) is a link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key user part, providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain, and end the connections for calls. Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is used to create database queries and invoke advanced network functionality, or links to <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part</b> (INAP) for intelligent networks, or Mobile Application Part (MAP) for mobile services.|$|E

40|$|Telecommunication {{applications}} {{have become}} {{some of the}} most important aspects of our daily life, especially with the Internet-based applications that are available even on cell phones. One of the challenges faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase of the number of subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Telecom companies evaluate their products' performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load. To do this, powerful solutions are needed, which generate traffic by modeling different telecom protocols. In this thesis, we propose a new technique of modeling a traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator is modeled to load the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, mobile call originating, mobile call terminating, and call clearing. Based on that, we model the Radio Access <b>Network</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Part</b> protocol' procedures to generate the radio access messages that carry and handle the mobile messages. These mobile messages will be represented through the Mobility Management and the Call Control protocols' models. To achieve the above goals, we utilize the UML Use Case Model to describe the functional behaviors of the traffic generator, also we present the UML Analysis Model that provides the logical implementation of the functional behaviors of the proposed traffic generator...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the <b>intelligent</b> <b>network</b> modes based on the Smart Grid concept with the {{function}} of two-way energy flow, both from the power system and from its sources of distributed generation. The expanded interpretation {{and the meaning of}} the intellectual network concept - Smart Grid - is proposed, based on its abbreviation, which determines the system criteria for its purpose. A new concept is introduced and new definition - Holonic Approach - Smart Grid concept. A new term has been introduced: - "Generating Consumer-Holon" (GC-Holon), which means the ability of an electric consumer to independently generate energy using renewable sources, store it, exchange energy with other similar GC-Holon and the main generating system. In connection with this, the concept of a generating consumer has been introduced. To construct an <b>intelligent</b> <b>network,</b> a holonic structure based on a set of holons (subsystems) is used. The holonic structure assumes subsystems of different nature, located at different levels of aggregation, interconnected in order to form a hierarchy of self-regulating holons, called Holarchy. According to A. Koestler, holons are simultaneously, both whole and partial. They are basically autonomous, which allows them to ensure their existence independently. The two-way energy flow for the holonic structure assumes the possibility of generation and storage of energy due to the internal structure of the electric consumer. The infrastructure of an <b>intelligent</b> <b>network</b> and its <b>applications</b> are considered. A mathematical model of bilateral electric power consumption by a generating consumer is proposed, taking into account tariffs and pricing. This allows you to flexibly regulate energy flow and align the load schedule, minimizing financial expenses for consumed energy...|$|R
