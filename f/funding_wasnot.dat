50|$|Royalty {{funds are}} a {{specific}} type of income trust, used for special-purpose finance, created to hold investments or cash flow in operating companies. These <b>funds</b> <b>aren’t</b> stocks or bonds but a form of investment fund. A royalty fund raises capital in order to purchase the right to a royalty of a product or service. However, unlike many other corporate entities, the profits derived from the royalties aren’t taxed on a corporate level. These profits are distributed to shareholders {{in the form of a}} dividend, which is taxed on the personal income level. By doing so it avoids double taxation, enabling higher returns on dividends. Thus making royalty funds an attractive investment.|$|R

50|$|However, {{this sort}} of fund can cause {{liquidity}} issues, if a lot of shareholders decide to withdraw their funds, resulting in {{a negative effect on}} performance of the fund. This also makes open-end funds less suitable for certain assets. For example, in 2007-2008 during the financial crisis, investors lost a lot of capital, because the <b>fund</b> managers <b>weren't</b> able to sell off assets quick enough. The investors capital was stuck in the funds for months.|$|R

50|$|Tatjana (Zrinka Cvitešić) and Miljenko (Robert Ugrina) are a young married Croatian couple {{living in}} Germany. Miljenko is killed when he falls {{while working on}} a {{construction}} site and his employer pays a financial settlement to his young widow. Tatjana then moves back to the rural countryside of Croatia where the couple first met. There she meets Father Stipan (Leon Lučev), an alcoholic Catholic priest of the local rundown church. Tatjana uses the settlement money to make a romantic purchase of the hill where Miljenko proposed to her only {{to make a small}} fortune when a local developer discovers precious minerals in the hill and pays Tatjana handsomely for it. She uses her newly acquired riches to purchase a grocery store and a hotel. Tatjana becomes a target for new prospective suitors, including her husband's brother Marinko (Ivo Gregurević), who has also recently returned from Germany. Tatjana falls in love with the troubled priest and offers most of her money to him so that the church can be repaired and the parish does not go bankrupt. Under the local bishop's (Ivica Vidović) threat of relocation if the <b>funds</b> <b>aren't</b> raised, Father Stipan is torn between choosing to accept Tatjana's money to be given to the church and choosing Tatjana's love.|$|R
40|$|Education. The {{one thing}} {{everyone}} needs {{and no one}} thinks is good enough. Wherever students and policy makers turn there is the desire for something more, something better, {{coming out of the}} public education system. Over the years more and more funding has been poured into the education system in attempt to increase the student success rates and intellect of American students. However, American students are still behind internationally and more and more jobs are going to students from different countries. Is there a point when the money being funneled into education doesn’t make enough difference in student achievement and success? When looking at education spending economically, is it a problem of diminishing marginal returns? Is there a better way to spend money in education? Through this analysis, it is hoped that a greater understanding of the diminishing marginal returns on per-pupil spending will be evident and that the issues, other than simply spending, will be brought to the forefront of the education reform discussion. Also through this analysis, a better understanding of school funding, the type of funding that schools are receiving and how they are using said funding, and how that funding might be more successful in educating America’s children will be seen. It is not that the <b>funding</b> <b>isn’t</b> necessary, it is that the current funding is not doing what it America’s schools need...|$|R

25|$|In May 1937, the Broward County Medical Association (BCMA) met {{to discuss}} {{plans to build}} a public hospital, feeling that private {{hospitals}} could not be relied upon for continuity of service and only a community-owned hospital would offer security. The consensus of the meeting was to build a hospital supported by the city, county, or a hospital district. The result of the meeting was a unanimous motion to form the Broward Hospital Association (BHA). From that point on, the BHA began its mission to raise the funds needed to build a hospital. The Chairman, James D. Camp, {{as well as the other}} members, explored every possibility of finding funds; however, government-assisted <b>funding</b> simply <b>wasn’t</b> available.

Later he attended Harvard summer school and gained an M.A. from Livingstone College and an LL.D. from Wilberforce University.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is the {{heterogeneity}} for fund manager as investor and an asymmetric volatility under short-sales constraints and if so, which factors are driving for it in Korean fund market using fund return data over period of 2002 - 2008.
