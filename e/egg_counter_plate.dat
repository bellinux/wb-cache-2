40|$|Polyamides (PAs) form a major {{class of}} tribo-polymers used in {{various types of}} {{friction}} and wear situations, especially because they exhibit advanced mechanical properties and abrasive wear resistance. In this paper, the influence of fillers like molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2) and nanoparticles in polyamides describing friction and wear behaviour was investigated. Reciprocating wear experiments were performed in polyamide 6 (PA 6) and polyamide 6. 6 (PA 6. 6) against low carbon steel <b>counter</b> <b>plates</b> using a medium scale flat on flat tribotester. The polymer test specimens were slid at a constant velocity of 10 mm/s and contact pressure of 10 MPa was included. The experimental results demonstrates that the friction coefficient of PA 6 increase with increasing the temperature caused by frictional heating. PA 6. 6 composite filled with molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2) has lower coefficient of friction on comparing with PA 6 due to the addition of nanoparticles.
