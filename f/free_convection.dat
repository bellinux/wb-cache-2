25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible <b>free</b> <b>convection</b> whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{distinctive}} feature of induction furnaces with cold crucible is the skull melting without introducing any impurities in the melt and overheating of the melt over 3000 Â°C at air. Therefore {{the technology of}} induction melting in cold crucible is suitable for high temperature synthesis of oxide materials. This paper describes a new technology for continuous melting and pouring of oxide melts. A new type of cold crucible with two chambers is used for this application. In the first chamber the charged oxide is melted and transferred via a barrier to the second chamber where the oxide is superheated before pouring over a discharging hole. During {{the transfer of the}} melted oxide from the melting zone into the superheating zone the transport of non-melted oxide particles has to be avoided. This transport is mainly influenced by the hydrodynamics of the melt flow and the temperature field during melting and pouring. Numerical simulation is used to investigate the heat and mass transfer during the melting and pouring processes in the cold crucible furnace. Both forced and <b>free</b> <b>convections</b> are taken into account in the simulation. Apart from the melt flow inside the cold crucible special attention is also paid to the behavior of the pouring stream.
