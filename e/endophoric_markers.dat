This study will draw on Hyland’s (2005) {{metadiscourse}} model where code glosses, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> evidentials, frame markers and transition markers {{are included in}} the interactive dimension, and attitude markers, boosters, engagement markers, hedges and self mention are to be found within interactional metadiscourse. I shall apply this framework for the identification and analysis of data in a corpus which comprises a selection of recipes taken from both Middle English Medical Texts (Taavitsainen – Pahta – Mäkinen 2005) and The corpus of early English recipes. The metadiscursive approach to the study of medical recipes will allow us to establish links between authors, texts and audience of the recipe genre and, consequently, to affirm their status as products of social engagement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMaking EFL/ESL {{students}} {{aware of}} {{effective and efficient}} reading strategies that assist in the reading of English texts has been the concern of educators and researchers, and specifically reading instructors for years. Dissatisfaction with the current methods of teaching English and awareness of {{the positive effect of}} strategy training has led teachers in Iran to adopt holistic approaches to text processing. Of equal concern is to make students metacognitively aware of strategies and techniques that promote reading comprehension in terms of the macro level characteristics of the text. Text structure knowledge has been recognized as an efficient strategy that enhances reading comprehension. To this end, 85 Iranian EFL learners were provided with instruction on discourse structuring signals (transitional words, frame markers, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> code glosses, and punctuation marks) during one semester. The results demonstrated that metacognitive awareness of text structure and overt teaching of textual features facilitate students’ reading comprehension...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} metadiscourse in the persuasive essays of fourth graders from both {{urban and rural}} communities: 224 students in South Korea and 188 in the US. Each student was asked to write a persuasive essay {{in his or her}} native Korean or English in response to a story not previously read or discussed. Analysis with a taxonomy developed by Hyland (2004) indicated significant differences in the metadiscourse by country. In terms of interactive metadiscourse, South Korean students used more sentence-level transitions than U. S. students, who used more frame markers and <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers.</b> With regard to interactional metadiscourse, U. S. students used more hedges, boosters, engagement markers, and self-mentions in their essays. This study also compared the students′ essays by the type of community in which the writers lived. In the US the essays of students in rural communities contained more hedges, whereas those of students in urban areas included significantly more self-mentions. In South Korea, no significant difference was detected in the metadiscourse of students living in rural and urban areas...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of clause-linking strategies in mostly Austronesian languages, with particular focus on the functions of informational and referential hierarchy strategies in the architecture of complex clauses. Informational (topic, focus) hierarchy and its markers, structure clauses as subordinate via the contrast between presupposition vs. assertion. Referential hierarchy and its <b>markers</b> (<b>endophoric</b> demonstratives and definite markers), are another subordinating strategy based on the contrast between already referential/backgrounded clause vs. asserted main clause. Paths of evolution leading from coordinators or from endophoric demonstratives to informational hierarchy markers and to subordinating conjunctions or constructions are more specifically discussed. Informational hierarchy and referential hierarchy strategies are argued to be inherent to the syntactic architecture of the complex clause...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the misuses of two main categories of metadiscourse markers used by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|Metadiscourse is an {{appealing}} field of inquiry which {{plays an important}} role in organizing and producing persuasive writing, based on the norms and expectations of people involved. The fuzziness of the term Metadiscourse remains obscure as it is seen in the literature. Having based this work on Ken Hyland’s framework for Metadiscourse, the researchers applied his definition and classification of the term. Hyland describes Metadiscourse as the linguistic resources used to organize a discourse or the writer’s stance towards either its content or the reader. He has divided Metadiscourse into two broad groups: Interactive and Interactional. The former being subcategorized into: Transitions, Frame markers, <b>Endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> Evidentials, and Code-glosses. And the later being divided into Hedges, Boosters, Attitude markers, Engagement markers, and Self-mentions (Hyland, 2005). Focusing on these categorizations, the researchers would try to shed light on the Metadiscourse features applied in “Alice in Wonderland”, selected from the ‘Complete Illustrated Lewis Carroll’, and see how and to what extent Lewis Carroll has applied these Metadiscourse markers to make his story more impressive and persuasive. Of course, Hedges have not been counted in this novel because of the many works done about this marker earlier. The results of the study showed that the frequencies in Interactive/Interactional Metadiscourse groups have no meaningful differences. However, the frequencies demonstrate that the author has been fully aware of the norms of writing. The results of the study have pedagogical implications for teaching English Literature for literature students and language learners at pre-, upper-, and high-intermediate levels of language learning courses...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers and self-mentions). ...|$|E
40|$|Business {{communication}} {{has been}} the target of communicators for long. They emphasize the need to include writing classes across the business curricula (Russell, 2007). Almost two decades ago, Reinsch (1996 : 27) spoke of business communication as being “old but immature. It is essential but insecure. It is a practical-science with a potentially bright future”. However, he foresaw this bright future of business communication by enhancing the teaching of business communication skills and by strengthening research. It has not changed so much since then, but the volume being reviewed is a very positive research product. By the title of the book, Researching Discourse in Business Genres, one may think that it addresses a rather restrictive audience, such as academics dealing with discourse genres, which is the object of today’s most business related publications. On the contrary, in this book it appears as if authors have taken heed of Amidon’s (2008 : 452) call for further research in business communication, “particularly in one of the main areas that seems to define our discipline – genres of organizational writing”. The papers in this volume view this organizational writing from different angles, but most importantly from the fact that business genres are based on the interrelationship that exists among the variety of genres within a firm. Gillaerts, de Groot, Dieltjens, Heynderickx, and Jacobs provide an introductory overview and organize the collection of essays based on three types of discourse: internal, executive, and organizational. This selection of papers, in its first part (“Section 1 : Internal Discourse”), opens with PAUL GILLAERTS ’ approach to email use in a Belgian firm along with {{a close look at the}} use of metadiscourse. His conclusion finds a strong interaction between sender and receiver which makes his corpus of emails comparable to oral communication, with an abundance of interactive devices, such as transitions and <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> which reflect the typica...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{primarily}} intended to explore metatextual devices in EFL learners undergraduate thesis. The analysis was centered around metadiscourse taxonomy by Hyland (2005), cooperative principle (Maxim) by Grice, and cooperative principle based model of metadiscourse (metatext) devices by Abdi R (2010). This study explored kinds of metatextual devices in EFL learners‘ undergraduate thesis. The term metadiscourse (metatext) are {{the ways we}} articulate and construct interactions, stressing the fact that, as we speak or write, we negotiate with others, making decisions {{about the kind of}} effects we are having on our listeners or readers (Hyland, 2012 : 126). This study aims to (1) to find out metatextual devices commonly found in EFL learner‘s undergraduate thesis, (2) to find out how EFL learners‘ of IAIN Syekh Nurjati use common metatextual device in the thesis. There relate to the two research question of this study. The research is designed as qualitative research. The data is taken from undergraduate thesis belonging alumni of English language department in 2015. The technique of collecting data is documentation. Then, analyzed with content analysis based on Hyland‘s model investigate the devices that commonly used and how the used of common metatextual devices in the text. The data taken from the clever students, because product from the clever students is reliable and the data more valid. The thesis that analyzed by researcher are one sampling from alumni in 2015. That is not all part of thesis which analyzed, it just introduction chapter because this part of thesis have a key knowledge or information {{about what is going on}} in the next chapter related to the purposes of the study. The result shows that all of devices found in undergraduate thesis including transitions, frame markers, code glosses, evidential markers, engagement markers, self mention, <b>endophoric</b> <b>markers,</b> hedges, booster, and attitude markers, from all of those devices the metatextual devices commonly found in Dinto‘s undergraduate thesis is frame markers. Then, the use of common metatextual device in undergraduate thesis hypothesized that frame marker is a device which mostly help to meet the requirements of manner in the cooperative principle model because it help a writer making a text clearly such cooperative principle exactly maxim of manner.
