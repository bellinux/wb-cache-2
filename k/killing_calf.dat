5000|$|... #Caption: The Old Testament {{with the}} Deeds, the 17th century icon. The {{composition}} includes {{a scene of}} Abraham's meeting the angels, washing their feet, Sarah cooking dough, the servant <b>killing</b> the <b>calf.</b> The angel takes Lot and his daughters out of Sodom, and Lot's wife turns into a pillar of stone, then Lot is depicted with his daughters. There is none of these details in Rublev's icon.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the local}} legend, during Ganga's rule around 14th-15th Century AD, Lord Siva once killed a calf inadvertently. In order to cleanse sin of <b>killing</b> the <b>calf,</b> {{he had to take}} a bath in the Gosagaresvara pond and worship the lord Gosagaresvara. Thus the {{tradition}} began up to the present. People keep the practice of taking ritual bath in the temple tank and worship Gosagaresvara to cleanse the sin of killing cow.|$|R
50|$|The East pediment, {{also known}} as the Lioness pediment, {{contained}} in the centre two symmetrically placed lions <b>killing</b> a <b>calf</b> (only one has been recovered) and two snakes on the side corners. The meaning of this scene is again unknown. The lioness has both female (breast) and male (mane) details, probably arising from the lack of knowledge of the Greek artists on these animals, which no longer populated Greece in the 6th century BC.|$|R
5000|$|Plaskow {{wrote that}} the Rabbis of the Talmud {{employed}} a Midrashic method in which [...] "they reconstructed Jewish memory to see themselves in continuity with it." [...] She cited Midrash in which the Rabbis of the Talmud interpreted the Patriarchs as observing all the laws given at Sinai. Faced with apparently contrary Biblical passages, {{such as the one}} (Genesis 18:7-8) in which Abraham greets his angelic visitors by <b>killing</b> a <b>calf</b> and serving it with milk, the Rabbis reinterpreted the passage to bring it in line with the laws of Kashrut by saying that Abraham first served the milk and only later the meat.|$|R
60|$|Fifth. It may be {{many did}} take even offence at God in his {{converting}} and saving of thee by his grace, {{even as the}} elder son was offended with his father for <b>killing</b> the fatted <b>calf</b> for his brother, and yet that did not hinder the grace of God, nor make God abate his love to thy soul. This should make thee study to advance the grace of God in thy heart and life (Luke 15:21-32).|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of <b>killing</b> a <b>calf,</b> but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little later}} a fat, {{half-breed}} man--I should say from his curling hair {{that his mother}} was a negress and his father a Portuguese--appeared with some other nondescript fellows and began to give directions in a competent fashion about our oxen, also as to the <b>killing</b> of a <b>calf.</b> He spoke in bastard Portuguese, which I could understand, and I heard him talk of Umslopogaas to whom he pointed, as [...] "that nigger," [...] after the fashion of such cross-bred people who choose to consider themselves white men. Also he made uncomplimentary remarks about Hans, who of course understood every word he said. Evidently Thomaso's temper had been ruffled by this sudden and violent disturbance of his nap.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Killing {{behavior}} and consumption rate are important components that determine the final predation rate. We studied the predatory {{behavior of a}} female jaguar with one offspring in Hato Piñero in Venezuelan Los Llanos. Seven carcasses of freshly killed calves were found {{over a period of}} 9 days. Automatic video recording was used to document the jaguar’s behavior. Our study revealed a detailed, repetitive sequence of female jaguar behavior while hunting for calves. The sequence started with the female <b>killing</b> a <b>calf</b> by biting through the skull or neck, then she dragged the carcass to concealment, eviscerated it and left it concealed; then, the next evening, the female returned with its cub, fed intermittently for a total time of about 90 min while in the meantime it hunted for new prey. All this sequence seems to have a highly adaptive significance for a female jaguar rearing cubs and utilizing large prey. During the short period of our observations, the estimated kill rate of the female jaguar with one offspring was from 0. 67 to 1 calf per day. Proper cattle management is necessary to avoid high losses of calves from predation by jaguars...|$|R
2500|$|Blue whales — whose {{migration}} routes {{were previously}} unknown — were located by air, after {{some of the}} animals had been given temporary radio tags. The camera team spent three years on standby, using a microlight {{to land on the}} water nearby when they finally caught up with the creatures in the Gulf of California. The open ocean proved more difficult and over 400 days were spent in often unsuccessful filming trips. After six weeks, the crew chanced upon a school of spinner dolphins, which in turn led them to a shoal of tuna. Off Mexico, the behaviour of a flock of frigatebirds guided the cameramen to a group of sailfish and marlin: the fastest inhabitants of the sea. Near the coast of Natal in South Africa, the team spent two seasons attempting to film the annual sardine run, a huge congregation of predators such as sharks and dolphins, that assembles to feast on the migrating fish by corralling them into [...] "bait balls". Meanwhile, in Monterey Bay, orca were documented attacking gray whales and <b>killing</b> a <b>calf.</b> Filming in the deep ocean required the use of special submersibles. One of them enabled the crew to dive over a mile into the San Diego trench, where the carcass of a 40-ton gray whale had been placed to attract a large variety of scavengers.|$|R
5000|$|In October {{the woman}} {{returns from the}} pasture and begins writing her report again. Winter quickly follows, and soon the spring. One morning she spots a white crow, {{seemingly}} ostracized by her black brethren. Gradually the woman becomes disengaged from her past. In June, she and the animals return to the pasture, but this year she does not feel the same rapture as before. One day, while returning with Lynx after a walk, the woman sees a strange man <b>killing</b> Bella's bull <b>calf</b> with an ax. As Lynx runs to stop him, the man kills the loyal dog. The woman retrieves her rifle and shoots the stranger—killing him. After rolling the corpse over a high cliff, the woman buries her dog Lynx in a deep hole. The next morning, she and Bella the cow leave the pasture {{and return to the}} narrow valley.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and <b>killing</b> a whale <b>calf.</b> This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|R
40|$|The nmaA and nmaB genes, which {{code for}} UDP-GlcNAc- 2 -epimerase and UDP-ManNAc-dehydrogenase, respectively, are {{involved}} in capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in Mannheimia haemolytica A 1. A chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) cassette cloned behind an M. haemolytica A 1 promoter, plpcat, was created and used to interrupt nmaA and nmaB. A 1. 3 -kbp DNA fragment that encompasses part of nmaA and nmaB {{was replaced by the}} 1. 0 -kbp plpcat, resulting in a knockout mutant which is Cmr and unable to synthesize N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and N-acetylmannosaminuronic acid (ManNAcA). The DNA replacement was confirmed by Southern hybridization and PCR analyses of the nmaA and nmaB loci. Electron microscopy examination of the mutant showed the absence of capsular materials compared to the parent strain. The loss of NmaA and NmaB activity was confirmed by analysis of carbohydrate moieties using capillary electrophoresis. Serum sensitivity assays indicated that the acapsular mutant is as resistant as the encapsulated parent to complement-mediated <b>killing</b> by colostrum-deprived <b>calf</b> serum but is more sensitive to killing by immune bovine serum. Analysis of lipopolysaccharide prepared from the acapsular mutant and encapsulated parent confirmed that these strains have long O-polysaccharide chains, possibly conferring resistance to serum-mediated killing...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} the {{virulence}} of Escherichia coli O 141 was related to its ability to secrete catechols capable of transporting iron from serum transferrin to the bacterial cell. E. coli O 111 also produced similar compounds in synthetic medium {{but was unable to}} do so in serum. It was postulated that antibody interfered with the production of these substances by this strain. The present experiments show that horse antiserum to E. coli O 111 can induce bacterial <b>killing</b> in foetal <b>calf</b> serum, which, in contrast to the bactericidal effect of normal rabbit serum, cannot be reversed by Fe 3 +. Five IgG subfractions of increasing electrophoretic mobility were isolated from the 7 S fraction of the antiserum, all of which exerted a bactericidal effect on E. coli O 111 in calf serum which could not be prevented by Fe 3 +. The bacteriostatic effect induced by the fractions in the presence of transferrin could, however, be reversed by Fe 3 +. IgG and IgT were isolated from normal serum but neither of these activated calf serum complement or induced bacteriostasis in the presence of transferrin. These results show that specific antibody is responsible for these antibacterial effects and point to new problems concerning the role of iron compounds in the antibacterial effects of normal and specific immune serum...|$|R
50|$|Sumatran {{rhinoceroses}} are solitary creatures {{except for}} pairing before mating and during offspring rearing. Individuals have home ranges; bulls have territories {{as large as}} 50 km2, whereas females' ranges are 10 - 15 km2. The ranges of females appear to be spaced apart; males' ranges often overlap. No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. Marking their territories is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they wallow in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the rainy season, they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range. When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from ectoparasites and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, suppurations, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit {{no more than three}} wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80-300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.There has been little opportunity to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease.

40|$|William Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s {{family came}} from the area {{surrounding}} Stratford-upon-Avon. William 2 ̆ 7 s father, John Shakespeare, {{was the son of}} a respectable farmer at Snitterfield, just a few short miles from Stratford. John arrived in Stratford with a moderate inheritance and set up business as a local merchant and landowner. He is described as being a wool dealer and a glover in Stratford. He purchased two houses; one in Green-hill Street and another in Henley Street. In 1557, John married Mary Arden, daughter of a wealthy land owner, who brought with her an estate called 2 ̆ 2 Ashbies 2 ̆ 2 and an interest in two Snitterfield tenements. John and Mary settled in the house on Henley Street where all of their eight children are believed to have been born. John was successful in business and held many town offices until about the year 1575 when he began to suffer financial difficulties. William, the third child and eldest son in the Shakespeare family, was born when the family was still affluent and influential in Stratford. His christening date was recorded on April 26, 1564 and he spent his first twenty years as a resident of Stratford. It is assumed that William attended the public school in Stratford, which was known for its high quality of education. It was not unusual for boys at the school to be writing fluent Latin by the time they were eleven years old. Unfortunately, John Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s declining financial resources and the burden of supporting a large family made it impossible for William to be sent either to Oxford or to Cambridge upon graduation from the public school in Stratford. The period of time between William 2 ̆ 7 s graduation from public school and his appearance as a successful London dramatist is full of conjecture. Some sources claim he was apprenticed to a butcher, ran off to London and was accepted as a servant into a playhouse. This butcher story, however, most likely had its origin in a tradition that said, 2 ̆ 2 when he (Shakespeare) kill 2 ̆ 7 d a calfe, he would doe it in a high style, and make a speech. 2 ̆ 2 This probably refers to an old semi-dramatic entertainment called 2 ̆ 2 <b>killing</b> the <b>calf</b> 2 ̆ 2 in which the actor, behind a door or screen, using ventriloquism, went through a pretended performance of slaughtering a calf. The more dramatic the performance, the more the crowd enjoyed it. (The Globe_Illustrated Shakespeare, Greenwich House,l 9 B 3) Some historians believed that the youthful Shakespeare must have spent several years working as a law clerk because legal expressions are more frequently and accurately used in his writings than in any other author of the day. However, his familiarity with legal terminology could also be explained by the fact that his father was a leader in Stratford government for many years and the young William could have been exposed to legal proceedings in this way...|$|R
40|$|A DNA region {{involved}} in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide (CP) biosynthesis was identified and characterized {{by using a}} probe specific for the cpxD gene {{involved in}} CP export. The adjacent serotype 5 -specific CP biosynthesis region was cloned from a 5. 8 -kb BamHI fragment and an 8. 0 -kb EcoRI fragment of strain J 45 genomic DNA. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that this region contained four complete open reading frames, cps 5 A, cps 5 B, cps 5 C, and cps 5 D. Cps 5 A, Cps 5 B, and Cps 5 C showed low homology with several bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide or CP. However, Cps 5 D had high homology with KdsA proteins (3 -deoxy-d-manno- 2 -octulosonic acid 8 -phosphate synthetase) from other gram-negative bacteria. The G+C content of cps 5 ABC was substantially lower (28 %) than that of cps 5 D {{and the rest of}} the A. pleuropneumoniae chromosome (42 %). A 2. 1 -kb deletion spanning the cloned cps 5 ABC open reading frames was constructed and transferred into the J 45 chromosome by homologous recombination with a kanamycin resistance cassette to produce mutant J 45 - 100. Multiplex PCR confirmed the deletion in this region of J 45 - 100 DNA. J 45 - 100 did not produce intracellular or extracellular CP, indicating that cps 5 A, cps 5 B, and/or cps 5 C were involved in CP biosynthesis. However, biosynthesis of the Apx toxins, lipopolysaccharide, and membrane proteins was unaffected by the mutation. Besides lack of CP biosynthesis, and in contrast to J 45, J 45 - 100 grew faster, was sensitive to <b>killing</b> in precolostral <b>calf</b> serum, and was avirulent in pigs at an intratracheal challenge dose three times the 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) of strain J 45. At six times the J 45 LD 50, J 45 - 100 caused mild to moderate lung lesions but not death. Electroporation of cps 5 ABC into A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 strain 4074 generated strain 4074 (pJMLCPS 5), which expressed both serotype 1 and serotype 5 CP. However, serotype 1 capsule expression was diminished in 4074 (pJMLCPS 5) in comparison to 4074. The recombinant strain produced significantly less total CP (serotypes 1 and 5 CP combined) in log phase (P = 0. 0012) but significantly more total CP in late stationary phase than 4074 (P < 0. 0001). In addition, strain 4074 (pJMLCPS 5) caused less mortality and bacteremia in pigs and mice following respiratory challenge than strain 4074, indicating that virulence was affected by diminished capsule production. These results emphasize the importance of CP in the serum resistance and virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|R
