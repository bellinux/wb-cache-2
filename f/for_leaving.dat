5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

50|$|It {{had been}} {{suggested}} before the UK's referendum on European Union membership that Wales might vote {{by a majority}} for Remain while the UK as a whole voted <b>for</b> <b>Leave,</b> which would increase support for independence.

5|$|The {{game against}} the Islanders also {{featured}} a devastating open-ice hit by Dion Phaneuf on New York's Kyle Okposo that saw the young forward taken off on a stretcher and sent to hospital with a concussion. The hit led Pascal Morency to leave his team's bench to engage Phaneuf as a melee {{broke out in the}} aftermath of the check. The league reviewed the incident and suspended Morency ten games <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> the bench.|$|E

While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but reveals {{that there is no}} cure after Deadpool overpowers him.

5|$|For {{his last}} lap {{collision}} with teammate Jolyon Palmer, Kevin Magnussen received a ten-second time penalty, dropping him {{one place to}} 15th. He also received two penalty points to his licence. Carlos Sainz received a reprimand from the stewards <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> the pit lane one minute before it was allowed. He escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly afterwards, thereby not gaining an advantage. Upon his return to Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat recorded the first fastest lap of his career, and the first for the Italian team in their 190th Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason <b>for</b> <b>leaving.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) {{and found the}} skeleton of a decapitated adult male. The head {{was placed on the}} chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by no means certain, it was assumed that the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed in a glass coffin in the right aisle of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Kaladze {{became the}} most {{expensive}} Georgian footballer in history when Milan paid €16 million {{to bring him to}} Italy. He cited an injury to Aleksei Gerasimenko as his reason <b>for</b> <b>leaving.</b> At first, Kaladze was tried in different positions and faced competition for places in defense from players such as Jaap Stam and Cafu. In the 2002–03 season, however, he made 46 appearances in all competitions, including 27 Serie A appearances. That year, Milan won the Champions League, where they beat Juventus on penalties in the final (despite Kaladze missing his penalty) and the Coppa Italia, where they beat Roma 6–3 on aggregate in the final. After Kaladze's double success, the Georgian postal service issued a special stamp bearing the player's image. He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.|$|E

5|$|The NFL's {{struggle}} against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had {{a negative impact on}} the sale of home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.|$|E

5|$|The couple's first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, {{was born}} in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, {{and they did not}} communicate with each other for several years.|$|E
5|$|The season chosen <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> Pannonia {{was unusually}} early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|The third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the {{majority}} of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood.

He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he may live forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him to fall from the summit.|$|E

5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty <b>for</b> <b>leaving</b> Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang.
