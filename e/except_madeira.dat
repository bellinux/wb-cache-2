40|$|The Macaronesian {{arthropod}} fauna {{displays a}} number of characteristics typical of oceanic islands, including {{a high degree of}} endemism, ranging from 19 % for the Azores (Borges et al., 2005 a), to 28 % for Madeira (Borges et al., 2008 a), 30 % for Cape Verde (Arechavaleta etal., 2005) and 45 % for the Canary Islands (Izquierdo et al., 2004; see Table I). The preponderance of endemic species has made the Macaronesian islands an outstanding area for studies of evolution and speciation, and arthropods from these islands have been the focus of particularly intensive investigation in the last ten years. Numerous biogeographic analyses of Macaronesian arthropod groups have provided valuable insights into the processes regulating species richness as well as the relationships among the region's endemics (e. g. Juan et al., 1996; Arnedo & Ribera, 1999; Borges & Brown, 1999; Emerson et al., 1999, 2006; Emerson & Oromí, 2005; Dimitrov et al., 2008; Borges & Hortal, 2009; Hochkirch & Görzig, 2009). Here we investigate the factors shaping arthropod species richness and patterns of endemism in the Macaronesian archipelagos, considering two levels of analysis: a) individual archipelagos of the Macaronesian region (<b>except</b> <b>Madeira</b> and Salvages due to their limited number of islands), and b) all the islands of the region altogether. We do this following the recently published works of Whittaker et al. (2008) and Borges & Hortal (2009), examining data sets for several taxa from the Macaronesian archipelagos. […].

50|$|After 1871, the Insulana Shipping Company was {{the only}} entity {{responsible}} for regular traffic between the islands (<b>except</b> Corvo), <b>Madeira</b> and the United States. Yet, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships were sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. For the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands ceased (except between Faial-Pico and Lajes das Flores-Vila do Corvo).|$|R
60|$|We sailed on the 15th of July in the Norman, a {{beautiful}} ship, perfectly appointed. The voyage to England occupied a short fortnight, without a stop <b>except</b> at <b>Madeira.</b> A good and restful voyage for tired people, {{and there were}} several of us. I {{seemed to have been}} lecturing a thousand years, though it was only a twelvemonth, and a considerable number of the others were Reformers who were fagged out with their five months of seclusion in the Pretoria prison.|$|R
5000|$|Vanessa vulcania, the Canary red admiral, is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It is {{found on the}} Canary Islands (<b>except</b> Lanzarote) and <b>Madeira.</b> Previously, it was considered a subspecies of Vanessa indica, but has been raised to species level after research by Leestmans in 1992.|$|R
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), <b>except</b> for the <b>madeira</b> glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R
50|$|The Naval Aviation and {{the only}} ever {{existing}} Portuguese aircraft carrier {{have an important role}} in the subdue of the Army officers rebellion against the government of the National Dictatorship, occurred in April 1931. The planned military uprisings fail or are quickly dominated everywhere <b>except</b> in <b>Madeira,</b> where the rebels manage to control the island, with the support of part of the local population and of some exiled opposition politicians. The island would only be able to be retaken by the governmental forces through an amphibious operation, but the organization of an operation of this kind constituted an enormous challenge due to the state of neglect of the Navy. Under the leadership of the Navy Minister Magalhães Correia, the Navy was however able to improvise a flotilla of adapted merchant and fishing vessels that was able to join the few operational warships for the carry out of the operation. One of the vessels of this flotilla was the merchant ship Cubango which was transformed in a seaplane tender, so in the only aircraft carrier ever employed by the Portuguese Navy. Supported by the Cubando, four CAMS 37 flying boats of the AN were part of the force. The naval flying boats carried away an important task of reconnaissance and support of the Government ground forces, being able to identify the rebel positions and the ambushes prepared against the landing forces, despite the rebel anti-aircraft fire which included the use of improvised surface to air rockets adapted from fireworks materiel. The action of the Naval Aviation ended by being crucial for the victory of the Government forces in the early May.|$|R
40|$|Abstract text	Introduction: Cysticercosis {{results from}} the {{ingestion}} Taenia solium eggs directly by faecal-oral route or contaminated food or water. While, still considered {{a leading cause of}} acquired epilepsy in developed countries, this zoonosis has been controlled or eradicated in industrialized countries due to significant improvements in sanitation, pig rearing and slaughterhouse control systems. Objectives: the health burden of human cysticercosis in Portugal. Material and Metodes: We developed a retrospective study on human neurocysticercosis (NCC) hospitalisations based on the national database resulting from National Health Service (NHS) hospital episodes <b>except</b> those of <b>Madeira</b> and Azores Islands. Results: Between 2006 and 2013 there were 357 hospitalized NCC cases in Portugal. Annual frequency of cases between 2006 - 2013 kept stable (mean 45). NCC was most frequent in those aged 25 - 34 years (59; 16, 5 %) and those > 75 years (65; 18, 2 %). Overall, mean age was 47, 3 years (median age 45, standard deviation 41, 1, mode 28) and 176 cases were in males (49, 3 %); no significant differences were observed between age and gender (t-student, p> 0, 05). In Norte Region cases tended to be older than in Lisboa and Vale do Tejo Region. Conclusions: The Directorate-General of Health established the National Observatory of Cysticercosis and Teniiasis which will define criteria for NCC cases monitoring and surveillance (hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases) ...|$|R
