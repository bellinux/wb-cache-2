The EHEC-Hly operon contains four E. coli hly homologs: EHEC-hlyA, EHEC-hlyC, EHEC-hlyB, and EHEC-hlyD. Shiga toxins (Stx) are the primary virulence factors in <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> but EHEC produces several other virulence factors capable of damaging the vascular endothelium in EHEC infections. EHEC-Hly is expressed in numerous EHEC serogroups known to cause severe infections in humans. EHEC-Hly is transported within EHEC-secreted outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in vitro. This mode of transport increases virulence by aiding in EHEC-Hly delivery to target cells.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In vitro {{bactericidal}} {{activity of}} four antimicrobial agents was determined against nine strains of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Methods: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis {{was carried out}} with the Bio-Rad Gene Path system. Each antimicrobial agent was added to logarithmic phase of <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> (four strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7, two of E. coli O 26, two of E. coli O 111, and one of E. coli O 165) in broth to obtain a concentration of 10 or 50 mg/L, and viable cells were counted after 1, 2, 6 and 24 h. Results: All nine strains were confirmed to differ in their DNA pattern by pulsed-field gel electrophor-esis. Norfloxacin at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg/L had bactericidal effects on all nine strains of <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli.</b> However, cefoperazone, kanamycin and fosfomycin had no bactericidal effects on some strains.

40|$|International audienceThe highly virulent Escherichia coli O 104 :H 4 {{that caused}} the large 2011 {{outbreak}} of diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome secretes blended virulence factors of <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> and enteroaggregative <b>E.</b> <b>coli,</b> but their secretion pathways are unknown.

The OMVs contain Shiga toxin (Stx) 2 a, the major virulence factor of the strain, Shigella enterotoxin 1, H 4 flagellin, and O 104 lipopolysaccharide. The OMVs bind to and are internalised by human intestinal epithelial cells via dynamin-dependent and Stx 2 a-independent endocytosis, deliver the OMV-associated virulence factors intracellularly and induce caspase- 9 -mediated apoptosis and interleukin- 8 secretion. Stx 2 a is the key OMV component responsible for the cytotoxicity, whereas flagellin and lipopolysaccharide are the major interleukin- 8 inducers.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) is associated with pathogenic or enteroadherent Escherichia coli. METHODS: A least two stool specimens and one rectal biopsy were taken from 30 patients with IBD and from 20 controls. A large number of E coli-like colonies cultured from each stool sample and biopsy was tested, using DNA probes, {{for the presence of}} genes encoding shiga-like toxins, invasiveness, attachment-effacement and the ability to adhere to HEp- 2 cells. Similarity among isolates from stool samples and rectal biopsies was determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. RESULTS: <b>Enterohaemorrhagic</b> and enteroinvasive <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> were not found in samples from either patients or controls. No significant difference in the detection rate of enteroadherent <b>E</b> <b>coli</b> between patients and controls was found.

40|$|Background: Shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx 2) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} virulence factors in <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> Escherichia <b>coli</b> (<b>E.</b> <b>coli)</b> strains such as O 157 H 7. Subtypes of Stx 2 are diverse with respect to their sequence, toxicity, and distribution. The most diverse Stx 2 subtype, Stx 2 f, is difficult to detect immunologically, but is becoming more frequently associated with human illness. Methods and Findings: A purification regimen was developed for the purification of Stx 2 f involving cation exchange, hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and gel filtration. The molecular weight of Stx 2 f B-subunit was approximately 5 kDa, which appeared significantly smaller than that of Stx 2 a (6 kDa) on a SDS-PAGE gel, although the size of the A subunit was similar to Stx 2 a (30 kDa). Stx 2 f was shown to be active in both cell-free and cell-based assays. The 50 % cytotoxic dose in Vero cells was 3. 4 or 1. 7 pg (depending on the assay conditions), about 3 – 5 times higher than the archetypical Stx 2 a, while the activity of Stx 2 f and Stx 2 a in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system was similar. Stx 2 f bound to both globotriose-lipopolysaccharide (Gb 3 -LPS) and globotetraose-LPS (Gb 4 -LPS, mimics for globotriaosylceramide and globotetraosylcer-amide, respectively), but its ability to bind Gb 4 -LPS was much stronger than Stx 2 a. Stx 2 f was also much more stable at low pH and high temperature compared to Stx 2 a, suggesting the toxin itself may survive harsher food preparation practices. Conclusions: Here, we detail the purification, biochemical properties, and toxicity of Stx 2 f, from an <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strain isolate...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred and thirty carcasses were swabbed and analysed by classical microbiological methods for total E. coli counts and {{for the presence of}} pathogenic E. coli. The E. coli counts were high, with a 75 th percentile of 444. 75 CFUs cm(- 2). For pathogenic E. coli, more than 7 % of the tested carcasses were positive for E. coli O 157. Eighteen E. coli O 157 strains were isolated and typed by multiplex PCR. The main isolated pathotype (78 %) was eae+ stx 2 + ehxA+. In addition to E. coli O 157, other attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) were also detected from carcasses by colony hybridization after pre-enrichment and plating on sorbitol MacConkey agar using eae, stx 1 and stx 2 probes. Thirty carcasses (13 %) on the 230 analysed harboured at least one colony positive for one of the tested probes. These positive carcasses were different from those positive for E. coli O 157. Sixty-six colonies (2. 9 %) positive by colony hybridization were isolated. The majority (60. 6 %) of the positive strains harboured an enteropathogenic E. coli-like pathotype (eae+ stx-).

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the global hygiene of the slaughterhouse was low, as indicated by the high level of E. coli count. The prevalence of both E. coli O 157 and other AEEC was also high, representing a real hazard for consumers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study of this type in Algeria, which indicates that the general hygiene of the slaughterhouse must be improved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Faecal {{samples from}} 146 diarrhoeic lambs and goat kids, and from 511 healthy {{sheep and goats}} were {{screened}} {{for the presence of}} Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). In healthy sheep and goats, VTEC were isolated in 24. 4 and 16. 2 % of the animals, respectively. Moreover, VTEC were detected in 3. 1 and 5. 9 % of the diarrhoeic lambs and goat kids, respectively. These data suggest that VTEC seems not to be associated with diarrhoea in lambs and goat kids. Only four VTEC strains were eae-positive. The absence of the eae gene in most of these VTEC strains could indicate that these strains are less virulent for humans that the classical eae-positive <b>enterohaemorrhagic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> types.

40|$|Abstract Haemolytic uraemic {{syndrome}} (HUS) can {{be classified}} according to the aetiology of the different disorders from which it is composed. The most prevalent form is that induced by shigatoxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and, in some tropical regions, by Shigella dysenteriae type 1. STEC cause a zoonosis, are widely distributed in nature, enter the food chain in different ways, and show regional differences. Not all STEC are human pathogens. <b>Enterohaemorrhagic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> usually cause attachment and effacing lesions in the intestine. This is not essential, but production of a shigatoxin (Stx) is. Because Stx are encoded by a bacteriophage, this property is transferable to naïve strains. Laboratory methods have improved by identifying STEC either via the toxin or its bacteriophage. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 produces shigatoxin, identical to Stx- 1, but also has entero-invasive properties that enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) do not. Shigella patients risk bacteremia and benefit from early antibiotic treatment, unlike those with EHEC...|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli EDL 933 {{is known}} to cause infection in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 {{is used as a}} probiotic strain to prevent infection (63). When the mouse intestine is pre-colonized with <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 it prevents <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 from growing up in the intestine. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 is not eliminated from the intestine; it stays at the level in which it was fed to the mice. The P 41 L envZ missense mutation was previously shown to causes an increase in the level of phosporylated OmpR (OmpR~P) produced (67). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 with the P 41 L missense envZ mutation is referred to as <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 mot- 1. These changes result in an improvement of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655 colonization ability in the mouse intestine. The EnvZ/OmpR system positively regulates the small RNAs omrA and omrB (29). omrA and omrB were shown to negatively regulate a number of outer membrane genes including ompT, cirA, fepA, and fecA, (29). omrA and omrB work by hybridizing to mRNA thereby preventing translation from occurring (28). The mutant envZ gene was transferred to <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 to create <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). The mutant envZ gene results in <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 having improved colonization ability. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) grows slower than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype on many sugars and in cecal mucus. The <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) mutant grows slower on galactose than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. When the ability to utilize galactose is eliminated from <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) it can no longer grow up in the mouse intestine in the presence of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. This displays the importance of galactose utilization in the intestine for <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1). <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) may have access to a niche where galactose is being utilized that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 is unable to inhabit. If <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 was able to inhabit that niche then it would seem likely that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 would out compete <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) due to its superior ability to utilize galactose. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) was then colonized against <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 to see if its improved colonization ability also results in improved probiotic potential. After performing multiple colonization experiments it is evident that <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 envZ(mot- 1) is not a better probiotic than <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 wildtype. ...|$|R
40|$|Different Escherichia coli strains {{generally}} {{have the same}} metabolic capacity for growth on sugars in vitro, but they appear to use different sugars in the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine (Fabich et al., Infect. Immun. 76 : 1143 - 1152, 2008). Here, mice were precolonized with any of three human commensal strains (<b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> HS, or <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917) and 10 days later were fed 105 CFU of the same strains. While each precolonized strain nearly eliminated its isogenic strain, confirming that colonization resistance can be modeled in mice, each allowed growth of the other commensal strains to higher numbers, consistent with different commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains using different nutrients in the intestine. Mice were also precolonized with any of five commensal <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains for 10 days and then were fed 105 CFU of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933, an O 157 :H 7 pathogen. <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> Nissle 1917 and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EFC 1 limited growth of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 in the intestine (103 to 104 CFU/gram of feces), whereas <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> MG 1655, <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> HS, and <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EFC 2 allowed growth to higher numbers (106 to 107 CFU/gram of feces). Importantly, when <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> EDL 933 was fed to mice previously co-colonized with three <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> strains (MG 1655, HS, and Nissle 1917), it was eliminated from the intestine (< 10 CFU/gram of feces).

However, in nature, biofilms are often composed of multiple species {{and the resulting}} polymicrobial interactions influence industrially and clinically relevant outcomes such as performance and drug resistance.

In contrast, ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is significantly increased in a polymicrobial <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans biofilm as compared to an axenic <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> biofilm. The increased ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is mainly biofilm-specific as ofloxacin-tolerance of <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> is less pronounced in polymicrobial <b>E.</b> <b>coli</b> / C. albicans planktonic cultures.
