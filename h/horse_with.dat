40|$|Objective – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the added value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when it is in combination with clinical examination, endoscopy and a pulmonary function test in <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> respiratory disorders and to determine the outcome of <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> respiratory disease with regard to performance and recurrence of symptoms. Study design – Retrospective Hypothesis – In this study, the following two research hypotheses are examined. H 1 : The prognosis for RAO-prone horses is not as good as the prognosis for <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> other respiratory diseases. RAO-prone horses suffer more frequently from the recurrence of symptoms. H 2 : BAL is of added value in the diagnosis of respiratory disease. Animals – 70 client-owned <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> a history of respiratory disease. Methods – To evaluate the condition of the <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> respiratory disease after they had been treated, owners were asked to fill in a standardized questionnaire about the performance and health status of their <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> a history of respiratory symptoms. To evaluate the added value of BAL, equine internal medicine specialists were contacted and asked to fill in a written questionnaire with cases about how they would diagnose different respiratory diseases in <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> symptoms of respiratory problems. Special attention was paid to the following question: Would the diagnosis have been different if the clinical examination, endoscopy and pulmonary function test had been combined with a BAL. Results and conclusions– RAO-prone horses did not suffer more frequently from recurrent airway problems compared to <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> respiratory diseases other than RAO. Further, BAL is of added value in diagnosing <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> respiratory disease and should not be omitted from the examination. _____________________________________ Abbreviations – BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; RAO, Recurrent Airway Obstruction; COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; EIPH, Exercise Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage; IAD, Inflammatory Airway Diseas...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} radiographic abnormalities (lesions) in Thoroughbred racehorses at 2 -year-old in-training sales and determine whether these lesions and 1 -furlong presale workout times were associated with subsequent racing performance. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Animals: 953 Thoroughbreds. Procedures: Repository radiographs of carpal, metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal (fetlock), stifle, and tarsal (hock) joints were examined. <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> lesions were classified by lesion type and location. Race performance variables were compared between <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> and without lesions and between horses categorized by 1 -furlong presale workout times (< or ≥ 11 seconds). Results: 299 horses had ≥ 1 lesion, and 654 had no lesion detected. Odds of starting a race and of earning money racing were lower for <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> any lesion and lower for <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> proximal phalangeal dorsoproximal articular margin chip fracture, proximal sesamoid bone fracture or sesamoiditis, or wedge-shaped central or third tarsal bones, compared <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> that had no lesion. For horses that raced, proximal phalangeal dorsoproximal articular margin chip fractures were associated with lower lifetime earnings, and flattening of the medial femoral condyle was associated with fewer 3 -year-old racing starts, compared <b>with</b> values for <b>horses</b> that had no lesion. <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> workout times < 11 seconds had greater odds of having lifetime starts, lifetime earnings, and maximum purse above threshold (median) values than did <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> slower workout times.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} cortisol concentrations in <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> colic. In humans with septic shock, high cortisol levels {{are associated with}} an increased risk of death. The objectives of this study were to compare the serum total cortisol concentrations (STCCs) in <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> colic to those without colic, and to assess whether the STCC relates to the pathological nature or outcome of the disease. STCCs were determined at presentation in <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> colic and in systemically healthy ‘control’ <b>horses.</b> <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> colic were grouped based on clinical and clinico-pathological parameters at admission, treatment, lesion type and location, and outcome. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed using two different outcome measures: (a) whether the horse had colic or not (yes vs. no), and (b) horse STCC (&# 8805; 200 [*]nmol/L vs. [*]&# 60; 200 [*]nmol/L). Horses {{were more likely to have}} colic if they presented with high STCCs (&# 8805; 200 [*]nmol/L compared with &# 60; 200 [*]nmol/L). <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> colic and with STCCs[*]&# 8805; 200 nmol/L were more likely to have moderate or severe colic signs (compared with mild colic) and heart rates[*]&# 62; 45 beats per min (compared with &# 8804; 45 beats per min).

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> {{atrial fibrillation}} for hypercoagulability; plasma D-dimer concentrations, {{as a marker}} of a procoagulant state; and a relationship between coagulation profile results and duration of atrial fibrillation or presence of structural heart disease. DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS Plasma samples from 42 <b>horses</b> (25 <b>with</b> atrial fibrillation and 17 without cardiovascular or systemic disease [control group]). PROCEDURES Results of hematologic tests (ie, plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, and antithrombin activity) in horses were recorded to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. Historical and clinical variables, as associated with a hypercoagulable state in other species, were also recorded. RESULTS <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> atrial fibrillation and control horses lacked clinical signs of hypercoagulation or thromboembolism. Compared <b>with</b> control <b>horses,</b> <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> atrial fibrillation had significantly lower antithrombin activity. No significant differences in plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations and prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times existed between horse groups. In <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> atrial fibrillation versus control horses, a significantly larger proportion had an abnormal plasma D-dimer concentration (10 / 25 vs 2 / 17), test results indicative of subclinical activated coagulation (18 / 25 vs 6 / 17), or abnormal coagulation test results (25 / 121 vs 7 / 85), respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} the clinical use of regional limb perfusion with antimicrobials (A-RLP), complications, and outcome {{in a large}} series of patients. DESIGN—Retrospective case series. ANIMALS— 174 horses. PROCEDURES—Medical records of <b>horses</b> treated <b>with</b> A-RLP between 1999 and 2009 were reviewed. Signalment, primary complaint, horse use, etiology, duration of clinical signs, previous treatment, structures involved, concurrent conditions, A-RLP characteristics, additional treatments, complications, and outcome were recorded. At long-term follow-up, 2 outcomes were investigated: survival rate and return to previous use at the same or higher level. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS—Group 1 (96 horses) included septic synovitis. Group 2 (50 horses) included extrasynovial lacerations (23 horses) and fresh, minimally contaminated intrasynovial lacerations without evidence of established synovial infection (27 horses). Group 3 (28 horses) included miscellaneous other conditions. Only minor complications were reported in 12. 26 % of horses that received IV (n = 155) and 33 % of horses that received intraosseous (27) A-RLP. <b>Horses</b> <b>with</b> septic synovitis had a lower survival rate (53. 43 %) than did <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> lacerations (91. 89 %). Within group 2, {{no significant differences in}} short- or long-term outcomes were found between <b>horses</b> <b>with</b> extrasynovial and fresh, minimally contaminated intrasynovial lacerations.
