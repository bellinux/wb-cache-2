40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial to investigate whether exercise and low molecular weight heparin therapy with <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (Fragmin) would improve collateral function to the ischemic myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease. Background. The severity of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease is at least partly dependent on the status of the collateral circulation. Therefore, improvement in collateral function would potentially provide a unique way of alleviating myocardial ischemia. Because the combination of ischemia and heparin has previously been demonstrated to enhance collateral growth, we studied the anti-ischemic effects of combined treatment with <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> and exercise-induced ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods. Twenty-three patients with stable coronary artery disease were randomized to receive either subcutaneous <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> or placebo for a 4 -week period. Patients received either placebo or 10, 000 IU of <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> by subcutaneous injection once daily for weeks 1 and 2 and 5, 000 IU daily for weeks 3 and 4. During the 1 st 2 weeks, patients were exercised to ischemia three times a day. At baseline and 4 weeks after treatment, treadmill exercise testing, exercise radionuclide ventriculography nd 48 -h ambulatory ST segment monitoring were performed. Results. Eight (80 %) of the 10 dalteparin sodium-treated patients compared with 4 (31 %) of 13 placebo-treated patients (p < 0. 02) had an increased rate-pressure product at the onset of 1 mm of ST segment depression. The duration of exercise to ischemia increased in all patients treated with low molecular weight heparin and in 62 % of placebo-treated patients (p < 0. 03). The number and duration of episodes of ST segment depression during ambulatory monitoring decreased by 30 % and 35 %, respectively (p < 0. 05), in the <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> group but were unchanged in the placebo group. The decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction with exercise was lower in 80 % of dalteparin sodium-treated patients compared with 54 % of placebo-treated patients (p = 0. 06). When all five factors reflecting collateral function were considered together in a multivariate analysis of variance, there was a significant improvement in low molecular weight heparin-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (p = 0. 014). Conclusions. This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that exercise and low molecular weight heparin therapy with <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> lessen myocardial ischemia and that the improvement is likely to be mediated by enhanced collateral function...|$|E

40|$|Background: We were {{concerned}} that a fixed rather than a weight-based dosing regimen of <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> to prevent venous thromboembolism. (VTE) might result in decreased efficacy in obese patients and decreased safety in elderly patients. Methods: We retrospectively performed subgroup analyses using the database from the Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for Prevention of VTE in Immobilized Patients (PREVENT) Trial, a study of 3706 hospitalized, medically ill patients randomized to receive either <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 5000 U/d, or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of symptomatic VTE, fatal pulmonary embolism, sudden death, or asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis by day 21. Obesity {{was defined as a}} body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of 30 or greater for men and 28. 6 or greater for women. Results: Overall, 1118 patients (30. 4 %) were obese and 1226 (33. 3 %) were 75 years or older. In obese patients, the primary end point occurred in 2. 8 % of the dalteparin and in 4. 3 % of the placebo groups (relative risk, 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 32 - 1. 28). In patients 75 years or older, the primary end point was reported in 4. 2 % of the dalteparin and in 8. 0 % of the placebo groups (relative risk, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 31 - 0. 87). The dalteparin effect for the primary end point (odds ratio, 0. 51; 95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 82) was not attenuated when adjusted for age, sex, obesity, history of VTE, and varicose veins. Dalteparin was not associated with an increase in major hemorrhage by day 21 in obese (0 % vs 0. 7 % placebo; P>. 99) and in elderly (1. 1 % vs 0. 7 %; P =. 12) patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a fixed low dose of <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> of 5000 U/d is effective and safe in preventing VTE in obese and elderly hospitalized medical patients...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{selective}} {{and accurate}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) method {{has been developed}} for the rapid separation and identification of various low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and unfractionated heparin. Separation and operational parameters were investigated using <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> as the test LMWH. The developed method used a 70 cm fused silica capillary (50 m i. d.) with a detection window 8. 5 cm from the distal end. Phosphate electrolyte (pH 3. 5; 50 mM), an applied voltage of − 30 kV, UV detection at 230 nm and sample injection at 20 mbar for 5 s were used. The method performance was assessed in terms of linearity, selectivity, intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. The method was successfully applied to the European Pharmacopeia LMWH standard, <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> enoxaparin sodium and heparin sodium with {{a significant reduction in}} the run time and increased resolution compared with previously reported CE methods. Different CE separation profiles were obtained for various LMWHs and unfractionated heparin showing significant structural diversity. The current methodology was sensitive enough to reveal minor constituent differences between two different batches of enoxaparin sodium. This CE method also clearly showed chemical changes that occurred to LMWHs under different stress conditions. The sensitivity, selectivity and simplicity of the developed method allow its application in research or manufacturing for the identification, stability analysis, characterization and monitoring of batch-to-batch consistency of different low molecular weight and unfractionated heparins. © 2007 Elsevier B.

No published trials have compared LMWHs, and few studies have examined outpatient therapy for PE. Only tinzaparin sodium has demonstrated superiority to unfractionated heparin in a clinical trial. Methods: We compared 2 LMWH products, tinzapa-rin and <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> {{for the treatment}} of acute DVT and PE in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of con-secutive outpatients presenting to a venous thromboem-bolism service at 4 tertiary-care hospitals. Patients were treated with subcutaneous tinzaparin sodium, 175 IU/kg every 24 hours, or subcutaneous <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 200 IU/kg every 24 hours, for at least 5 days. Warfarin so-dium therapy was started simultaneously and contin-ued for 90 days. The primary end point was efficacy (re-currence of venous thromboembolism); safety (bleeding) was a composite end point. Results: Two hundred fifty-four patients received tin-zaparin (39 with PE and 215 with DVT) and 251 re-ceived dalteparin (51 with PE and 200 with DVT). Most patients had an active malignancy or idiopathic DVT/ PE. The outcome events occurred in 11 (4. 4 %; 95 % con-fidence interval [CI], 2. 2 %- 7. 7 %) and 15 patients (5. 9 %; 95 % CI, 3. 3 %- 9. 5 %) in the dalteparin and tinzaparin groups, respectively, including 9 and 10 recurrences, re-spectively, and 2 and 5 major hemorrhages, respectively (P=. 44). The 95 % CI on the difference of − 1. 5 % was − 5. 3 % to 2. 4 %. Conclusions: Tinzaparin and dalteparin are safe and ef-fective for the outpatient treatment of DVT or PE. Our finding of no differences between the LMWHs based on major clinical end points means that practical issues can be the deciding factor on which drug to use.

40|$|The low {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH), <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> was administered subcutaneously (100 IU/kg) to 8 healthy cats twice daily for 13 doses. Anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) activity was measured prior to administration (time 0), and 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after the 1 st dose, 4 h after administration of the 3 rd dose, and at 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after the last dose. Four cats developed measurable anti-Xa activity 4 h following a single dose, returning to baseline by 6 h. Anti-Xa activity was not detected at any time point in 4 cats. Prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), and antithrombin (AT) concentrations were unaffected by LMWH administration.

40|$|Background: DVT {{incidence}} in Southeast Asian {{countries has}} been {{presumed to be}} low. Method: The current {{article is based on}} a prospective study carried out on 130 patients of Indian origin. All patients were to undergo surgeries for fractures around the hip, THA or TKA. A pre operative CCDS was carried out to screen all the patients for pre existing DVT, followed by a postoperative CCDS at end of one week. All 100 enrolled patients received LMWH (<b>Dalteparin</b> <b>Sodium)</b> as a prophylaxis till CCDS. Results: 31 / 90 (34. 44 &#x 0025;) showed signs of postoperative DVT with a predominantly distal presentation. 29 / 130 (22. 3 &#x 0025;) of the screened patients showed signs of pre-existing DVT. DVT incidence was highest in TKA patients. Conclusion: Postoperative DVT is as common in the Indian population as any other parts of the world, significant number of patients have pre-existing DVT. LMWH helps reduce the rate and extent of postoperative DVT but does not give full protection. It is a safe and effective method for prophylaxis...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy is a {{condition}} of increased affinity to blood clotting. The most important changes of coagulation system in pregnancy involve the increase of the following coagulation factors: fibrinogen production, level of numerous blood coagulation factors- FII, FVII, FVIII, FX, FXII, acquired activated protein C resistance, and the decrease of: fibrinolysis due to the increase {{of a large number}} of fibrinolytic activator inhibitors PAI- 1 and PAI- 2, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor TAFI, and levels of proteins S and C. This disease is not a disease on its own, but a group of inherited and acquired coagulation disorders that increase the predisposition to thrombosis. The treatment of choice in pregnancy are low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) which are derived from standard heparin by controlled hydrolysis, thus obtaining heparins of a lower molecular mass. The most commonly used LMWHs are: <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> enoxaparin, nadroparin-calcium, reviparin. LMWH is given in prophylactic doses – low and medium doses in therapeutic doses. Thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy is implemented as: intrapartal, intra- and postpartum according to the official recommendations of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

A total of 172 women, aged < 40 years, without laboratory findings of thrombophilia and undergoing their first IVF cycle, were randomly allocated to treatment (n = 86) and control (n = 86) groups. Patients {{allocated to the}} treatment group received low-molecular-weight heparin <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> 2500 IU s. c. daily, in addition to routine luteal phase support, from oocyte retrieval up to {{the day of the}} pregnancy test or up to the ninth week of pregnancy in the cases of positive human chorionic gonadotrophin. From the day after the oocyte retrieval, all patients began standard supplementation with vaginal progesterone 200 mg twice a day. At the sixth week of pregnancy, patients underwent an ultrasound scan to assess the number/viability of gestational sacs. Implantation rates were 15 % and 12 % in the dalteparin and control groups, respectively. The clinical pregnancy rates/embryo transfers were 26 % (19 / 73) and 20 % (16 / 80), in the dalteparin and control groups, respectively, with live birth rates/embryo transfer of 21 % (15 / 73) and 16 % (13 / 80). Despite the lack of statistical significance, the increase in pregnancies observed in the treatment group may be considered as an important clinical point in the optimization of IVF clinical outcome. © 2011 ALPHA Scientists in Reproductive Medicine and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology...|$|E
40|$|Effect of anticoagulation {{on blood}} {{membrane}} interactions during hemodialysis. BackgroundAdequate anticoagulation is a precondition to prevent extracorporeal blood clotting {{and to improve}} biocompatibility during hemodialysis. In this study, we performed a morphologic analysis by using scanning electron microscopy to compare three modes of anticoagulation—conventional unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium),</b> or sodium citrate during hemodialysis—on membrane-associated coagulation activation. MethodsFifteen patients on regular hemodialysis therapy were investigated. Five patients received UFH, five patients LMWH, and five patients sodium citrate as an anticoagulant during a standardized hemodialysis protocol using a single-use polysulfone capillary dialyzer. Membrane-associated clotting was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope. A dialyzer clotting score was used for quantitative description of coagulation activation on membrane segments. ResultsUsing UFH as an anticoagulant revealed the most pronounced cell adhesion and thrombus formation and the highest dialyzer clotting score (11. 5 ± 1. 3 of a maximal 20 points). LMWH had a lower dialyzer clotting score than UFH (10. 4 ± 1. 2 of 20 points). During the use of sodium citrate, a negligible thrombus formation and the lowest dialyzer clotting score (1. 6 ± 0. 6 of 20 points, P < 0. 05) were observed. ConclusionThe results of this investigation indicate that using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis induces a lower activation of coagulation than both conventional and fractionated heparin, which might contribute to an improvement of biocompatibility of hemodialysis extracorporeal circulation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Patients {{undergoing}} abdominal surgeries face {{substantial risk}} of experiencing venous thromboembolic {{events in the}} perioperative period. The low-molecular-weight heparin <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium</b> is clinically effective in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients. Dalteparin {{may be used in}} low (2500 units [U]) and high (5000 U) once-daily doses for this indication. However, the cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000 U compared with dalteparin 2500 U and unfractionated heparin (UFH) for this indication has not been studied. Objective: To conduct a cost-utility analysis to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dalteparin compared with UFH for preventing VTE in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Methods: A Markov model, from a healthcare perspective, was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000 U and dalteparin 2500 U compared with UFH. A 69 -year-old mixed sex patient population was studied using pooled probabilities of clinical outcomes from randomised, controlled trials. Cost data were mostly derived from Medicare reimbursement, in year 2002 - 03 values. Cost effectiveness was measured as cost per QALY gained over the patient's lifetime. Results: Total costs for patients given UFH, dalteparin 2500 U and dalteparin 5000 U were $US 45 _ 855, $US 45 _ 882 and $US 46 _ 308, respectively, while QALYs were 9. 5603, 9. 5632 and 9. 5811, respectively. Hence, the incremental cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000 U over dalteparin 2500 U and UFH was $US 23 _ 799 /QALY and $US 21 _ 779 /QALY gained, respectively. Similarly, cost effectiveness for dalteparin 2500 U over UFH was $US 9310 /QALY gained. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed that dalteparin 5000 U maintained its cost effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = 90 % patients receive the benefit of the medication, policy makers would need to commit substantially more resources than suggested by the baseline ICERs.

40|$|Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa {{inhibitor}} that {{is currently}} undergoing investigation in phase III clinical trials {{for the prevention of}} stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Factor Xa is an attractive target for anticoagulant treatment, as it is the primary and rate-limiting source of amplification in the coagulation cascade. Edoxaban is a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa and has > 10 [*] 000 -fold greater selectivity for factor Xa relative to thrombin. In phase I clinical trials, the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban included dose-dependent increases in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time following single edoxaban doses of 10 - 150 [*]mg and after multiple ascending doses (60 [*]mg twice daily, 90 [*]mg daily and 120 [*]mg daily). The anticoagulant effects of edoxaban were rapid in onset (time to peak plasma concentration 1 - 2 hours) and sustained for up to 24 hours. Prolongation of bleeding time in 8 % of subjects was > 9. 5 minutes (none of which appeared to be clinically significant) 2 hours after initial dosing, and was independent of edoxaban dose, formulation or dietary state. In general, plasma edoxaban concentrations were linearly correlated with coagulation parameters. Phase II clinical trials in patients with AF and VTE suggest that the edoxaban 30 [*]mg once-daily and 60 [*]mg once-daily regimens had a similar or better safety profile compared with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2. 0 - 3. 0) in terms of bleeding events, and that edoxaban was not associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition, edoxaban was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in VTE after orthopaedic surgery compared with placebo or <b>dalteparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> Further clinical investigation of the efficacy and safety of once-daily edoxaban is being conducted in phase III clinical trials in comparison with warfarin in patients with AF in the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (NCT 00781391), and in comparison with low-molecular weight heparin/warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in the HOKUSAI VTE trial (NCT 00986154) ...|$|E
