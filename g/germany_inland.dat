5000|$|In late {{classical}} times, as the Roman empire {{came under}} increasing pressure from outside tribal groups, {{the coast of}} Flanders itself {{became a part of}} the [...] "Saxon Shore", which was a militarized area under attack from seaborne Saxon raiders and invaders, coming from the direction of northern <b>Germany.</b> <b>Inland</b> parts of modern Flanders, Brabant and especially Limburg, came under pressure from the Frankish group of Germanic tribes, from across the Rhine. It is at this time that the fortifications underlying Oudenburg were built up. Eventually the inland Salian Franks converted to Christianity and came to rule the entire Belgian area and be treated as successors of Rome, spreading their rule into France, Germany and even as far as parts of Italy and Spain. But problems continued with invasions and raids from more northerly Germanic Vikings until well into the Middle Ages.|$|E

50|$|Saarlouis {{was famous}} for its nearby steel and iron ore {{production}} and its nearby mining facilities. Today, the Ford Motor Company is the city's largest employer, producing the Ford Focus and Ford Kuga. The plant in the Roederberg suburb is one of Ford's most efficient facilities worldwide.The industrial port in Saarlouis-Roden is <b>Germany's</b> 8th largest <b>inland</b> port.

50|$|Actinocyclus normanii {{probably}} originated as {{a marine}} species from the Baltic Sea, {{the coasts of}} Norway and Germany and the Caspian Sea. It {{has been found in}} fresh water in <b>inland</b> <b>Germany.</b> It is also found in the north west Atlantic Ocean, in the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy. It has been found in Narmada river at the distance of 50 km from gulf of Khambat, Gujarat, India. The form Actinocyclus normanii f. subsalsus is considered an invading species in the Great Lakes where it was probably introduced in about 1938 in ballast water.|$|R
5000|$|The Dortmund-Ems Canal is a 269 km long canal in <b>Germany</b> {{between the}} <b>inland</b> port {{of the city}} of Dortmund (...) and the sea port of Emden. The {{artificial}} southern part of the canal ends after 215 km at Herbrum lock near Meppen. The route then takes the river Ems for 45 km to Oldersum lock. From there, the canal continues along a second artificial segment of 98 km. This latter section was built because inland ships {{at the time of the}} construction of the canal were not built for the open sea, which they would have faced at the Dollart and the entry to the sea port of Emden. It is connected to the Ems-Jade Canal from Emden to Wilhelmshaven.|$|R
50|$|While Julius Caesar (100-44 BC) {{was well}} {{informed}} about the regions and tribes on the eastern banks of the Rhine, he never mentioned the Chatti by name. He did make note of the Suebi though, and suggested that they had previously driven out the Celts {{to the south of}} the region corresponding to modern north Hesse in the prior centuries BC (cfr. the early medieval Hessengau). Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (written 77-79 AD) grouped the Chatti and Suebi together with the Hermunduri and the Cherusci, calling this group the Hermiones, which is a nation of Germanic tribes mentioned by Tacitus as living in <b>inland</b> <b>Germany.</b> Some commentators believe that Caesar's Suebi were possibly the later Chatti, a branch of the Suebian movement of people who had become more clearly identifiable. If not, then the Chatti may represent a successful resistance to the Suevi, as opposed to the Tencteri, Usipetes, and Ubii who all were forced from homelands in the same region by the Suebic incursions.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} that Peters made with Mwanga was nullified by the 1 July 1890 treaty between Britain and <b>Germany,</b> which extended <b>inland</b> {{the line of}} division between their areas of influence in East Africa, leaving Buganda in the British sphere and moving the centre of interest from the coast to the hinterland. The Imperial British East Africa Company sent Frederick Lugard, its military administrator, to Mengo, where in December 1890 he got Mwanga to accept {{for a period of}} two years an agreement with the Company. This agreement was advantageous for Mwanga when the Muslims in Bunyoro made another attempt to recover power. Friction between the Catholic and the Protestant parties led to fighting in January 1892 in Mengo. Lugard supported the Protestants against the stronger Catholic side in the fighting, forcing Mwanga and the Catholics to flee. Lugard managed to persuade Mwanga to return from German territory, where he had taken refuge, to Mengo on 30 March 1892 and to make a new treaty. This treaty assigned separate areas to Protestants (the largest area), Catholics, and (only a small area) Muslims; Mwanga himself nominally became a Protestant.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{build up}} {{sufficient}} {{knowledge of a}} ‘healthy diet’. Here, {{we report on the}} assessment of nutritional knowledge using a uniform method in a large sample of adolescents across Europe. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The European multicentre HELENA (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence) study conducted in 2006 – 2007 in ten cities in Austria, Belgium, France, <b>Germany,</b> Greece (one <b>inland</b> and one island city), Hungary, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Subjects: A total of 3546 adolescents (aged 12, 5 – 17, 5 years) completed a validated nutritional knowledge test (NKT). Socio-economic variables and anthropometric data were considered as potential confounders. Results: NKT scores increased with age and girls had higher scores compared with boys (62 % v. 59 %;P< 0, 0001). Scores were approximately 10 % lower in ‘immigrant’ adolescents or in adolescents with ‘immigrant’ mothers. Misconceptions with respect to the sugar content in food or in beverages were found. Overall, there was no correlation between BMI values and NKT scores. After categorization according to BMI, scores increased significantly with BMI group only in boys. These differences disappeared after controlling for socio-economic status (SES). Smoking status and educational level of the mother influenced the NKT scores significantly in boys, as well as the educational levels of both parents in girls. Conclusions: Nutritional knowledge was modest in our sample. Interventions should be focused on the lower SES segments of the population. They should be initiated at a younger age and should be combined with environmental prevention (e. g. healthy meals in school canteens). HELEN...|$|R
