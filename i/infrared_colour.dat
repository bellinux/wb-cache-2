The algorithms tested in this pilot study are variants of the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) approach, which is ideal for exploratory studies of classification problems where interrelations between variables and classes are complicated.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{catalogue}} of 1602 white dwarf-main sequence binaries (WDMS) from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR 6). Among these we identify 440 as new WDMS binaries. We select WDMS binary candidates from template fitting all 1. 27 million DR 6 spectra, using combined constraints in both χ^ 2 and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we use Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and UKIRT Infrared Sky Survey (UKIDSS) magnitudes to search for objects in {{which one of the}} two components dominates the SDSS spectrum. We use a decomposition/fitting technique to measure the effective temperatures, surface gravities, masses and distances to the white dwarfs, as well as the spectral types and distances to the companions in our catalogue. Distributions and density maps obtained from these stellar parameters are then used to study both the general properties and the selection effects of WDMS binaries in SDSS. We also make use of SDSS-GALEX-UKIDSS magnitudes to investigate the distribution of WDMS binaries, as well as their white dwarf effective temperatures and companion star spectral types, in ultraviolet to <b>infrared</b> <b>colour</b> space. We show that WDMS binaries can be very efficiently separated from single main sequence stars and white dwarfs when using a combined ultraviolet, optical, and <b>infrared</b> <b>colour</b> selection. Finally, we also provide radial velocities for 1068 systems measured from the NaI 8183. 27, 8194. 81 absorption doublet and/or the Hα emission line.

40|$|Determining the Galactic {{distribution}} {{and numbers of}} massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), is hampered by intervening Galactic or local circumstellar dust obscuration. In order to probe such regions of the Galaxy we can use infrared observations, which provide a means for finding such hidden populations through the dust. The availability of both 2 MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE large-scale survey data provides <b>infrared</b> <b>colours</b> from 1. 25 to 8 µm for a large fraction of the inner Galactic plane. In 2005 we initiated a pilot study of the combined set of <b>infrared</b> <b>colours</b> for two GLIMPSE fields and showed that WRs typically occupy a sparsely populated region of the colour space. We followed up 42 of our WR candidates spectroscopically in the near-infrared, and with limited additional observations {{of some of these}} candidates in the optical. Six new WRs, four late-type WN and two late-type WC stars, were discovered as a result. Of the remaining ∼ 86 % of the sample, five appear to be O-type stars. 21 stars are likely of type Be, and 10 stars appear to be of late-type, or possibly young stellar objects, which have “contaminated ” the infrared color space. The survey is generally unbiased towards clusters or field stars, and the new WRs found are in both the field and in and around the RCW 49 region (including cluster Westerlund 2). In this work, and in our other recent work, we show that the <b>infrared</b> broad-band <b>colours</b> to be the most efficient means of identifying (particularly, dust-obscured) candidate massive stars, notably WRs. ...|$|R

The main {{conclusion is that}} none of the 163 (non-) radial pulsators shows an IR excess flux due to free-free emission, {{despite the fact that the}} sample contains several rapid rotators. Two β Cep stars and two slowly pulsating B stars do exhibit an unexpected <b>infrared</b> <b>colour</b> excess at 12 µm. The small IR excess of the B 2 IV β Cep star HD 126341 (τ 1 Lup) is not accompanied by H α emission nor by a near-IR excess.

An optically thin dust model is fitted to the IR data and leads to the presence of circumstellar dust which is situated very far from the star. The infrared data of the star HD 42927 also point towards the presence of (hotter) dust which is situated close to the star.

Our analysis using a set of empirical and theoretical dusty starburst spectral energy distribution (SED) models shows that power-law continuum sources associated with hot dust heated by young (≲ 100 Myr old), extreme starbursts at z 3 ̆e 2 also occupy the same general area as AGNs in the IRAC colour–colour plots. A detailed comparison of the IRAC colours and SEDs demonstrates that the two populations are distinct from each other, with submillimetre-bright galaxies having a systematically flatter IRAC spectrum (≳ 1 mag bluer in the observed [4. 5]–[8. 0] colour). Only about 20 per cent of the objects overlap in the colour–colour plots, and this low fraction suggests that submillimetre galaxies powered by a dust-obscured AGN are not common.

The <b>infrared</b> <b>colour</b> temperatures of 350 - 390 K and low radio brightness suggest gravitational confinement of the H II regions and ongoing accretion at a rate of a few 10 ^- 8 M 0 /yr or more.

Typically, the infrared luminosities of these galaxies are found to be at the high end of star-forming galaxies with blue optical colours. Using emission-line diagnostic diagrams, 78 are found to have an AGN contribution and 117 are identified as star-forming systems. The red (g - r) colour of the star-forming galaxies could be explained by extinction. However, their high optical luminosities cannot. We conclude that they have a significant bulge component. The number densities of optically red star-forming galaxies are found to correspond to ~ 13 per cent of the total number density of our sample. In addition, these systems contribute ~ 13 per cent of the total optical luminosity density, and 28 per cent of the total infrared luminosity density of our SWIRE/SDSS sample. These objects may reduce the need for `dry mergers'...|$|R
