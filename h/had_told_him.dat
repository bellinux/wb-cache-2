5|$|After the {{retirement}} of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the Davis Cup team was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches, though Henman <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how wearing and time consuming that can be. While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert, Murray was obligated to play for his country, but in November, Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that {{that made his}} position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he}} had been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, 2008, Emanuel {{accepted}} {{the position of}} White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he {{may be interested in}} running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|The show's fans {{had shown}} dislike for other antagonists with multi-episode guest-starring arcs, and critics {{suspected}} that Tritter's character would receive similar disdain. The {{conclusion of the}} storyline, and Tritter's departure from the show, were described by USA Today critic Robert Bianco as a Christmas gift for fans of the show. Morse jokingly stated after his departure that various fans <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of their hate for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp testified {{after the}} gunfight that {{five or six}} weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he knew of Ike's {{meetings}} with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, {{as well as their}} attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.|$|E

60|$|Had he lived, that reverend form {{would have}} risen in its place, and, with a mild, parental reprehension to his nephew, the Duke of Bedford, he would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that {{the favor of}} that gracious prince who had honored his virtues with the {{government}} of the navy of Great Britain, and with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom, was not undeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life, and his faithful companion and counsellor under his rudest trials. He would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> that, to whomever else these reproaches might be becoming, they were not decorous in his near kindred.

5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma {{said that he would}} not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she was pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian was {{not called}} during the 1960–61 Australian season, but his {{performances}} were ineffective {{and he was}} repeatedly hampered by injuries. In particular, a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test. Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00; {{he was unable to}} complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures. These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests. During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by Col Egar, who later ended his career. He noted that the umpire <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> there was little point in changing his action.|$|E

5|$|The raid on bin Laden's {{compound}} in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military {{officials said that}} after the raid U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. According to Carlotta Gall, a Pakistani official (to whom she later clarified {{that she did not}} speak, the information coming through a friend), told her that a senior U.S. official <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all denied this.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the years, he {{received}} the Victory Medal, the Occupational Medal from the Mississippi Army National Guard, an honourable discharge (which he had not received upon leaving the army) and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, when he was 105 years old, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time, {{he was known as}} the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Though he could not speak coherently, his son Haywood Hardy, himself 80 years old at the time, recalled some of the stories that his father <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
