5|$|The DX {{structural}} motif <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{building block}} of the DNA origami method, {{which is used}} to make larger two- and three-dimensional structures of arbitrary shape. Instead of using individual DX tiles, a single long scaffold strand is folded into the desired shape by a number of short staple strands. When assembled, the scaffold strand is continuous through the double-helical domains, while the staple strands participate in the Holliday junctions as crossover strands.|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> unit of life, that all living things are {{composed}} {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> question which Jesus Himself raised when He came to <b>the</b> Jews. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> problem of <b>the</b> Reformation. It <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> problem that confronts the Church in our time.

The proof also implies that a non-uniform lattice in F_ 4 (- 20) cannot <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> group of a quasicompact Kähler manifold. We also construct {{examples in the}} spirit of Gromov-Thurston to show that our result is a non-trivial extension of the previously known result that a non-uniform lattice in real hyperbolic space in dimension at least 3 cannot <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> group of a quasicompact Kähler manifold.

5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
