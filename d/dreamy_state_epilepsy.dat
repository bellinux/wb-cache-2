60|$|The {{conversation}} dropped at this point, {{though the}} puffs went on languidly.

6000|$|Not so, however, with brute kind, as became {{apparent}} {{after he had}} advanced {{about half a mile}} in a <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> down the banks of the quiet river, for, happening to observe something of a tawny yellow colour among the bushes, he brought his gun to the [...] "present" [...] with great precipitancy, cocked both barrels, and advanced with the utmost caution.|$|R
6000|$|We lingered a {{long time}} around here, and could {{scarcely}} tear ourselves away. We paced up and down under the old trees, looking off on {{the waters of the}} Don, listening to the waving branches, and falling into a <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> of mind, thought what if it were six hundred years ago! and we were pious simple hearted old abbots! What a fine place that would be to walk up and down at eventide or on a Sabbath morning, reciting the penitential psalms, or reading St. Augustine! ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not stop}} till he had reached the river pool, when holding the pistol in his hand, he looked about him. At every little noise--the falling of a leaf, the rustle of an animal in the bushes, the cry of a night-bird--he sprang up and cocked his pistol in the {{direction}} of the sound. But though the moon still shone he saw nothing, and by and by a kind of <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> seemed to steal over him as he leant against a tree.|$|R
60|$|Here {{occurred}} {{a singular}} exemplification of the <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> {{of a very}} old man's mind. As they ascended the wide flight of stairs the aged clergyman appeared to move with caution, occasionally standing aside, and oftener bending his head, as it were in salutation, thus practising all the gestures of one who makes {{his way through a}} throng. Reaching the head of the staircase, he looked around with sad and solemn benignity, laid aside his staff, bared his hoary locks, and was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer.|$|R
60|$|But, by degrees, a {{sense of}} wonder had its will, and grew, slowly at first, in Redclyffe's mind; and almost twin-born with it, and growing piece by piece, there was {{a sense of}} awful fear, as his waking senses came slowly back to him. In the <b>dreamy</b> <b>state,</b> he had felt no fear; but, as a waking man, it was fearful to {{discover}} that the shadowy forms did not fly from his awaking eyes. He started at last to his feet from the low couch on which he had all this time been lying.|$|R
60|$|While Mr. Denham {{examined}} the manuscript, {{she glanced up}} at her grandfather, and, for the thousandth time, fell into a pleasant <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> in which {{she seemed to be}} the companion of those giant men, of their own lineage, at any rate, and the insignificant present moment was put to shame. That magnificent ghostly head on the canvas, surely, never beheld all the trivialities of a Sunday afternoon, and it did not seem to matter what she and this young man said to each other, for they were only small people.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{disappeared}} {{behind the wall}} of glistening bayonets, of blue coats and uplifted arms; mercifully for her she remembered nothing more very clearly. She felt herself being dragged out of the cell, the iron bar being thrust down behind her with a loud clang. Then in a vague, <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> of semi-unconsciousness she saw the heavy bolts being drawn back from the outer door, heard the grating of {{the key in the}} monumental lock, and the next moment {{a breath of fresh air}} brought the sensation of renewed life into her.|$|R
5000|$|Rassenfosse {{has often}} been linked with Felicien Rops as a follower. This is perhaps unfair. One author has said, for example, that while Rops portrayed curtesans, Rassenfosse {{depicted}} the daughters of working people. In his intimate nude studies the women have natural elegance, but are not purely objects of desire, as Rops would have made them. However, talking of Rassenfosse's earlier work another writer said that in his advertisements he and others of the time [...] "exploited {{the image of the}} sensuous, beautiful young woman ... in a serenely <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> ... the stylised embodiment of temptation..." ...|$|R
60|$|Independently of the {{pleasure}} one receives from particular pictures in these galleries, {{there is a}} general exaltation, apart from, critical considerations, an excitement of the nerves, a kind of <b>dreamy</b> <b>state,</b> which is a gain in our experience. Often in a landscape we first single out particular objects,--this old oak,--that cascade,--that ruin,--and derive from them, an individual joy; then relapsing, we view the landscape as a whole, and seem, to be surrounded by a kind of atmosphere of thought, the result of the combined influence of all. This state, too, I think is not without its influence in educating the æsthetic sense.|$|R
60|$|Mistress Affery, {{who stood}} at the table near him, pouring out the tea, {{happened}} in her <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> {{to look at him}} as he said these words, and to fancy that she caught an expression in his eyes which attracted her own eyes so that she could not get them away. The effect of this fancy was to keep her staring at him with the tea-pot in her hand, not only to her own great uneasiness, but manifestly to his, too; and, through them both, to Mrs Clennam's and Mr Flintwinch's. Thus a few ghostly moments supervened, when they were all confusedly staring without knowing why.|$|R

After recovering from a coma, he could not remember what happened that night - until now. Kwok's ghost appears to Chak and reminds him of what he promised her.|$|R

6000|$|To {{enjoy your}} holiday in bed to the full, you should {{let it be}} vaguely {{understood}} {{that there is something}} amiss with you. Don't go into details, for they are not necessary; and, besides, you want to be dreamy more or less, and the <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> is not consistent with a definite ailment. The moment one takes to bed he gets sympathy. He may be suffering from a tearing headache or a tooth that makes him cry out; but if he goes about his business, or even flops in a chair, true sympathy is denied him. Let him take to bed with one of those illnesses of which he can say with accuracy that he is not quite certain what is the matter with him, and his wife, for instance, will want to bathe his brow. She must not be made too anxious. That would not only be cruel to her, but it would wake you from the <b>dreamy</b> <b>state.</b> She must simply see that you are [...] "not yourself." [...] Women have an idea that unless men are [...] "not themselves" [...] they will not take to bed, and as a consequence your wife is tenderly thoughtful of you. Every little while she will ask you if you are feeling any better now, and you can reply, with the old regard for truth, that you are [...] "much about it." [...] You may even (for your own pleasure) talk of getting up now, when she will earnestly urge you to stay in bed until you feel easier. You consent; indeed, you are ready to do anything to please her.|$|R
60|$|To {{those few}} who saw Jonathan Zane in the village, {{it seemed as}} if he was in his usual quiet and <b>dreamy</b> <b>state.</b> The people were {{accustomed}} to his silence, and long since learned that what little time he spent in the settlement was not given to sociability. In the morning he sometimes lay with Colonel Zane's dog, Chief, by the side of a spring under an elm tree, and in the afternoon strolled aimlessly along the river bluff, or on the hillside. At night he sat on his brother's porch smoking a long Indian pipe. Since that day, now a week past, when he had returned with the stolen horses, his movements and habits were precisely what would have been expected of an unsuspicious borderman.|$|R

When awake, the Self experiences the Vishva - the external objects and the visible; when dreaming, it experiences the Taijasa - the internal mind objects and what appears in the dreams; when in deep sleep, the Self experiences Prajna - the unpolarized, the fruits of the heart and bliss. The description of these states of self are similar, states Arvind Sharma, to those found in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and other ancient Hindu texts.|$|R
60|$|There is {{something}} strangely winning to most women in that offer {{of the firm}} arm; the help is not wanted physically at that moment, but the sense of help, the presence of strength that is outside them and yet theirs, meets a continual want of the imagination. Either on that ground or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they walked together round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums, in the same dim, <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> {{as they had been}} in {{a quarter of an hour}} before; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without yet perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and Maggie had darting thoughts across the dimness,--how came he to be there? Why had she come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had been, each would have been less intensely conscious of the other.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} use {{of morning}} glory seeds by Mexican Native Americans was first described by Richard Schultes in 1941 {{in a short}} report documenting their use going back to Aztec times (cited in TiHKAL by Alexander Shulgin). Further research was published in 1960, when Don Thomes MacDougall reported that the seeds of Ipomoea tricolor were used as sacraments by certain Zapotecs, sometimes {{in conjunction with the}} seeds of Rivea corymbosa, another species which has a similar chemical composition, with lysergol instead of ergometrine. Ergine was assayed for human activity by Albert Hofmann in self-trials in 1947, well before it was known to be a natural compound. Intramuscular administration of a 500 microgram dose led to a tired, <b>dreamy</b> <b>state,</b> with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. After a short period of sleep the effects were gone, and normal baseline was recovered within five hours.|$|R
40|$|Please note: This {{article is}} in Greek. In this paper I {{will examine the}} “adventures” on {{narrative}} structure of Stelios Xefloudas. Stelios Xefloudas, a Greek writer of the Generation of the thirties was educated in both Greece and France and was an advocate of interior monologue and innovative novel in his country. During the thirties he wrote four innovative novels: Τα Τετράδια του Παύλου Φωτεινού (1930), Εσωτερική Συμφωνία (1932), Εύα (1934) and Στο Φως του Λευκού Αγγέλου (1936). These four novels are written with the technique of interior monologue and they explore themes such as the recording of the unconscious process, the <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> of self and escapism. Through these novels we’ll examine Xefloudas’ capacity in “constructing” female characters. For the writer it seems that character “construction” is a long and hard process regulated by his views on fiction {{as well as his}} personal limitations or impediments on narrative structure...|$|R
60|$|The {{overthrow}} of the temples at Troy was heavily visited on the Greeks by the gods, and the disasters that befel Ulysses {{are the subject of}} another grand Greek poem called the Odyssey, from his right Greek name Odysseus. He was the special favourite of Pallas Athene, but she could not save him from many dangers. He had twelve ships, with which he set out to return to Ithaca; but as he was doubling Cape Malea, one of the rugged points of the Peloponnesus, a great storm caught him, and drove him nine days westward, till he came to an island, where he sent three men to explore, but they did not return, and he found that this was the land of the lotus-eaters, a people who always lie about in a <b>dreamy</b> <b>state</b> of repose, and that to taste the food drives away all remembrance of home and friends. He was obliged to drag his men away by force, and bind them to the benches. The lotus bean, or jujube, is really eaten in Africa, but not with these effects.|$|R

He went away to build a firm {{foundation}} for his castle in the air, and Laura retired into an invisible convent, where she cast off the world, and regarded her sympathizing sisters through a grate of superior knowledge and unsharable grief. Like a devout nun, she worshipped [...] "St. Philip," [...] and firmly believed in his miraculous powers. She fancied that her woes set her apart from common cares, and slowly fell into a <b>dreamy</b> <b>state,</b> professing no interest in any mundane matter, but the art that first attracted Philip. Crayons, bread-crusts, and gray paper became glorified in Laura's eyes; and her one pleasure was to sit pale and still before her easel, day after day, filling her portfolios with the faces he had once admired. Her sisters observed that every Bacchus, Piping Faun, or Dying Gladiator bore some likeness to a comely countenance that heathen god or hero never owned; and seeing this, they privately rejoiced that she had found such solace for her grief.|$|R
