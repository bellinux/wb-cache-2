50|$|Matias Corporation is a {{computer}} accessories manufacturer, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company was founded in 1990 by Edgar Matias, Steve McGowan, and James McGowan. Matias' first hardware product was the <b>Half</b> <b>Keyboard,</b> a one-handed keyboard that exploits users' existing touch-typing skills. It can be learned {{in a matter of}} minutes. The company's first commercially successful product was Tactile Pro Keyboard. It was built from the same keyswitch technology (Alps switches) used in the Apple Extended Keyboard, widely viewed as the best keyboard Apple ever made.|$|E
40|$|Half-QWERTY {{is a new}} one-handed typing technique, {{designed}} to facilitate the transfer of two-handed typing skill to the one-handed condition. It is performed on a standard keyboard, or a special <b>half</b> <b>keyboard</b> (with full-sized keys). In an experiment using touch typists, hunt-and-peck typing speeds were surpassed after 3 - 4 hours of practice. Subjects reached 50 % of their two-handed typing speed after about 8 hours. After 10 hours, all subjects typed between 41 % and 73 % of their two-handed speed, ranging from 23. 8 to 42. 8 wpm. These results are important in providing access to disabled users, and {{for the design of}} compact computers.

50|$|A <b>half</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard</b> is a {{combination}} of an alpha-numeric keypad and a QWERTY keypad, designed for mobile phones. In a <b>half</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard,</b> two characters share the same key, which reduces the number of keys and increases the surface area of each key, useful for mobile phones that have little space for keys. It means that 'Q' and 'W' share the same key and the user must press the key once to type 'Q' and twice to type 'W'.|$|R
50|$|The Mirage was an 8-bit sampler {{featuring}} a 61 key velocity-sensitive keyboard, a two-digit LED display, extensive MIDI implementation, analog filters, a 333-event sequencer. It had 128kB of RAM (64kB for each <b>keyboard</b> <b>half)</b> {{and it was}} not expandable. Sample rate was variable from 10 kHz to 33 kHz with available sample time ranging from 2 to 6.5 seconds accordingly (for each <b>keyboard</b> <b>half).</b>|$|R

40|$|Half-QWERTY {{is a new}} one-handed typing technique, {{designed}} to facilitate the transfer of two-handed touch-typing skill to the onehanded condition. It is performed on a standard keyboard (with modified software), or a special <b>half</b> <b>keyboard</b> (with full-sized keys). In an experiment using touch-typists, hunt-and-peck typing speeds were surpassed after 3 - 4 hours of practice. Subjects reached 50 % of their two-handed typing speed after about 8 hours. After 10 hours, all subjects typed between 41 % and 73 % of their two-handed speed, ranging from 23. 8 to 42. 8 wpm. In extended testing, subjects achieved average one-handed speeds as high as 60 wpm and 83 % of their two-handed rate.

5000|$|Tiento de medio registro: A tiento {{making use}} of the split keyboard, {{frequently}} found on Spanish organs from the mid-16th century on. The split keyboard refers to an organ manual where ranks of pipes may be engaged for <b>half</b> the <b>keyboard,</b> {{as opposed to the}} entire compass, which is the norm. This enables the player to utilize different sounds on the same keyboard, generally a solo sound and an accompaniment sound, though occasionally two sounds of equal strength. The tiento de medio registro figures prominently in the oeuvres of Correa de Arauxo, Aguilera de Heredia, and Bruna.|$|R

5000|$|The AX-60 is bitimbral with 6 voice polyphony. The {{keyboard}} can be [...] "split" [...] to play two patches independently. The {{assignment of}} voices to each split side can be 0-6, 2-4, 4-2, or 6-0. Splits where no voices {{can be used}} for <b>half</b> of the <b>keyboard</b> are useful when the AX-60 is expanded with an Akai sampler. Each side of the split responds to a different MIDI channel.|$|R

Players could also choose between using three types of armor, three different weapons, and two types of shields. Players choosing the role of wizard were able to choose between five different spells. The game featured a two player mode which allowed players to work cooperatively or competitively. In two player mode, each player used <b>half</b> of the <b>keyboard</b> for their commands.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor's {{first solo}} album, Fun in Space, was {{released}} in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about <b>half</b> of the <b>keyboards,</b> which were done by engineer David Richards. With Queen still touring heavily and recording {{at the time of}} release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, [...] "Future Management", including Top of the Pops. The only other single to come from the album was [...] "My Country". The only US single released from the album was [...] "Let's Get Crazy".|$|R
50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the <b>keyboard</b> <b>half</b> would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|R
500|$|When Dylan {{arrived at}} the studio on January 25, 1966, {{he had yet to}} work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blondes first side. With Dylan piecing {{together}} the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: [...] "At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the <b>keyboard,</b> <b>half</b> Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension." ...|$|R
50|$|On September 9, 2009, Dell previewed a thinner Adamo XPS laptop design, {{which was}} 9.99 mm (0.39 inches) thick. It was {{released}} on November 5, 2009 and priced at USD 1,799. The laptop's bottom <b>half,</b> containing the <b>keyboard,</b> is smaller than {{the top half of}} the laptop containing the screen. The screen half is concave, so when shut the keyboard embeds itself into the screen. It is designed, that when open, the bottom of the screen half and the edge of the keyboard, make contact with the surface on which it is resting. The Adamo XPS has a heat-sensing strip on the lip of its lid which, when touched, opens the lid. Internally, it has either a 128 GB solid-state drive or a 180 GB hard drive. It uses 4GB of DDR3 memory and a 1.4 GHz Intel ULV (ultra low voltage) processor. The battery can run either 4 or 5 hours, depending on configuration.|$|R
50|$|The Microsoft Natural Keyboard is an {{ergonomic}} keyboard for computers, introduced in 1994. It {{was designed for}} Microsoft by Ziba Design. The keyboard was a split <b>keyboard</b> with each <b>half</b> of the <b>keyboard</b> separated and tilted upwards and down {{from the center of}} the keyboard. This key arrangement was ergonomically designed to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries associated with typing for long periods of time. Another innovation was the integrated wrist pad helping to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer and further reducing strain on the neck, arms and wrists.This keyboard also introduced three new keys purposed for Microsoft's upcoming operating system: two Windows logo keys between the Ctrl and Alt keys on each side, and a Menu key between the right Windows and Ctrl keys.Although it was not the first {{ergonomic keyboard}}, it was the first widely available sub-$100 offering. The keyboard gained popularity quickly, selling over 600,000 per month at its peak.|$|R

40|$|Basic {{information}} concerning common alternative keyboard designs {{and their effects}} on work posture was provided to aid in selection of alternative keyboard designs. Alternative keyboards may assist in keeping wrists straight, thus alleviating stress to the musculoskeletal system. Split keyboards may straighten the wrist by either increasing {{the distance between the}} right and left sides of the keyboard, or by rotating each <b>half</b> of the <b>keyboard.</b> Tented keyboards have the two keyboard halves tilted up, reducing the rotation of the forearms. Built in wrist or palm rests help prevent bending the hands up by providing support that straightens the wrists. Keyboards with a negative slope help straighten the wrist. Some keyboards attempt to fit the different lengths of the fingers by curving the rows of keys or by placing the keys in concave wells. In selecting alternative keyboards several matters must be considered: compatibility with existing hardware and software, fit {{with the rest of the}} workstation, effects on the performance of the user, use of a trial period, anticipating some initial frustration, involving a specialist in the decision making process, and integrating the new equipment into the work process carefully.

40|$|The fantasias and ricercars {{constitute}} {{almost a}} <b>half</b> the contrapuntal <b>keyboard</b> music of Johann Jacob Froberger (1616 – 1667) and just under {{a quarter of}} his entire keyboard music, providing fertile ground from which to study seventeenth-century counterpoint and its keyboard performance. Froberger’s historical significance, e. g. as ‘father’ of the keyboard suite, has often assumed greater importance than his music generating a bias for a small core of more popular genres and pieces amongst performers: a trend reflected across the surviving sources and likewise in current teaching and performance today. Froberger’s autograph collections arrange and group the fantasias and ricercars into single-genre sets, and these complexes display clear agendas of balance, contrast and self-referencing within and between pieces. The wider source dissemination is discussed in this essay as it locates with {{the context of the}} music’s reception history. Issues of performance practice, including ornamentation, tempo and meter, articulation and phrasing, instrumental designation, expression and affekt, and notational practices are considered. The composer’s compositional methods and contrapuntal skills are scrutinised and compared with contemporary theories of counterpoint, and a new analytic approach is outlined to understand better Froberger’s reliance on motivic construction which has practical applications to musical theory, historical inquiry and performance. It is proposed that the fantasias and ricercars form a distinctive grouping within Froberger’s contrapuntal keyboard music which complements the toccatas, suites and lamentations and, in comparison with them, represents a less overt, equally rhetorical, and more intellectually ‘virtuosic’ interpretation of the stylus fantasticus...|$|R
