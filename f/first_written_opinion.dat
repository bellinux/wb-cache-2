2500|$|Alito {{delivered}} his <b>first</b> <b>written</b> <b>opinion</b> on May 1, 2006 {{in the case}} Holmes v. South Carolina, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. [...] (Since {{the beginning of the}} Rehnquist Court, new justices have been given unanimous opinions to write as their first majority court opinion, often done as a courtesy [...] "breaking in" [...] of new justices, so that every justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under his/her belt). Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in Zedner v. United States, Woodford v. Ngo, and Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy.|$|E
5000|$|... is a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that a company is not a [...] "debt collector" [...] under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) if it purchased that debt and then attempts to collect from the debtor.

50|$|The {{opinion was}} {{delivered}} by Justice Samuel Alito, and {{was his first}} opinion {{as a member of}} the Court following his confirmation on January 31, 2006. This follows a Supreme Court tradition that the <b>first</b> <b>written</b> <b>opinion</b> of a new justice reflect a unanimous decision. Also, this case had marked the last time in ten years that Clarence Thomas had asked a question during oral argument. This period of silence lasted until shortly after the death of Antonin Scalia, with the oral argument during Voisine v. United States.|$|E

As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|R

[...] She went on {{to point out that}} there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men [...] "lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy".|$|R

50|$|On August 5, 1791, Johnson {{received}} a recess appointment from Washington {{to the seat}} on the U.S. Supreme Court that became available after John Rutledge resigned. Formally nominated on October 31, 1791, Johnson was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 7, 1791. Though he received his commission that day, he was not sworn in until August 6, 1792. Johnson {{was the author of}} the Court's <b>first</b> <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> Georgia v. Brailsford, in 1792. He served on the court until January 16, 1793, when he resigned, citing his poor health and the difficulties of circuit-riding. His tenure of 163 days is the second shortest, to date, of any Justice.|$|E

40|$|Section 7 of the United States’ National Labor Relations Act allows {{groups of}} American workers {{to engage in}} concerted {{activity}} {{for the purposes of}} collective bargaining or for “other mutual aid or protection. ” This latter protection has been extended in cases such as Lafayette Park Hotel to workers outside the union context. Starting in 2005, the National Labor Relations Board increasingly signaled to employers that concerted activity may take place on social media such as Facebook. However, the Board proper delivered its <b>first</b> <b>written</b> <b>opinion</b> articulating these rules in the 2012 case of Hispanics United of Buffalo, Inc. There, the Board found the employer in question to have committed multiple unfair labor practices when it fired five employees over a series of Facebook posts due to violating the employer’s zero-tolerance no bullying policy. This article argues that the majority opinion of the Board misapplied Lafayette Park Hotel’s test for whether employer conduct “would reasonably tend to chill employees” from legitimate, protected uses of their § 7 rights. This article explains the two largest errors in the Board’s decision: (1) a failure to identify a missing, important element for concerted activity protection under § 7, the nexus between employee discussion and contemplated group action, and (2) asserting an “inferred group intent” existed that was “implicitly manifest” which linked the employees’ Facebook posts to contemplated group action protected under § 7. Members of the entire Board, as well as other legal scholars writing on this topic, have been guilty at different times of simplifying social media to being like a “virtual water cooler” for the 21 st century. The facts in Hispanics United show why this analogy does not work: rather than a short face-to-face conversation with a finite, known audience in the space of minutes, it was a series of written messages plopped down in sequential order throughout an entire day, written for an audience of unknown size and make-up that may not even include the co-workers it ostensibly addressed. As Hispanics United helps illustrate, the proper handling of employer retaliation on social media remains the sensible application of the established nexus requirement for finding concerted activity...|$|E

5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v.

In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with <b>written</b> <b>opinions.</b> Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|R
