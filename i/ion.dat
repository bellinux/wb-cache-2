When Tris was used to replace cxtcrnal sodium <b>ions,</b> increases in sodium effiux were always observed whether the sensitivity of sodium cfflux to external potassium <b>ions</b> was weak or strong. Greater percentage increases in sodium cfflux occurrccl, however, the greater the sensitivity of sodium effiux to external potassium <b>ions.</b> When lithium <b>ions</b> were used to replace external sodium <b>ions,</b> increases in sodium efliux occurred if the sensitivity of cfliux to external potassium <b>ions</b> was strong whcrcas decreases in sodium ctiIux took placc if the sensitivity of cfflux to external potassium <b>ions</b> was weak.

50|$|<b>Ions</b> {{cross the}} cell {{membrane}} under two influences: diffusion and electric fields. A simple example wherein two solutions—A and B—are {{separated by a}} porous barrier illustrates that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually mix into equal solutions. This mixing occurs because {{of the difference in}} their concentrations. The region with high concentration will diffuse out toward the region with low concentration. To extend the example, let solution A have 30 sodium <b>ions</b> and 30 chloride <b>ions.</b> Also, let solution B have only 20 sodium <b>ions</b> and 20 chloride <b>ions.</b> Assuming the barrier allows both types of <b>ions</b> to travel through it, then a steady state will be reached whereby both solutions have 25 sodium <b>ions</b> and 25 chloride <b>ions.</b> If, however, the porous barrier is selective to which <b>ions</b> are let through, then diffusion alone will not determine the resulting solution. Returning to the previous example, let's now construct a barrier that is permeable only to sodium <b>ions.</b> Now, only sodium is allowed to diffuse cross the barrier from its higher concentration in solution A to the lower concentration in solution B. This will result in a greater accumulation of sodium <b>ions</b> than chloride <b>ions</b> in solution B and a lesser number of sodium <b>ions</b> than chloride <b>ions</b> in solution A.|$|R
