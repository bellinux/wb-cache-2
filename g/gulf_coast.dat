5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast.</b> Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> skirmishes happened in February.

He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the <b>Gulf</b> <b>coast</b> was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E
