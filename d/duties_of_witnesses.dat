40|$|In Part I, this Note {{will discuss}} the current {{epidemic}} of human trafficking, the various ways the United Nations and the United States have attempted to combat trafficking, and highlight the importance of U. S. prosecutorial <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> protection that are especially implicated in human trafficking cases. Part II will present criticisms of efforts by the United Nations and the United States to protect victims of trafficking and their family members. This part will also focus on current U. S. protections afforded to families of human trafficking survivors and {{programs such as the}} Witness Security Program, from which U. S. lawmakers may model family protections. In Part III, this Note will argue that, despite an increase in cost, it is crucial that future legislative efforts expand current protection programs to better, and more quickly, protect families of victims. Offering family members in imminent harm derivative continued presence, currently only available to survivors of trafficking, is essential to the goals of U. S. trafficking legislation. Expanding protections for family members would accomplish three goals: (1) allow the survivor to feel secure in coming forward, knowing that her family members will not be harmed; (2) encourage survivors to come forward and cooperate with law enforcement officials, which could lead to further prosecutions of human traffickers and increase the protections offered to survivors of human trafficking; and (3) permit prosecutors to adhere to their <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> protection, which extend to family members who are in imminent danger due to the witnesses 2 ̆ 7 cooperation.

Though she believed that some document had been written, Mr Apjohn had not been sent for, as had always been done on former similar occasions. The making of the Squire's will had been a thing always known and well understood at Llanfeare. Mr Apjohn had been sent for on such occasions, and had returned after a day or two, accompanied by two clerks. It was quite understood that the clerks were there to witness the will. The old butler, who would bring in the sherry and biscuits after the operation, was well acquainted with all the testamentary circumstances of the occasions. Nothing of that kind had occurred now; but old Joseph Cantor, {{who had been a}} tenant on the property for the last thirty years, and his son, Joseph Cantor the younger, had been called in, and it was supposed that they had performed the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnessing</b> the document.

40|$|AbstractThe {{attitudes of}} courts in England to the {{assessment}} of damages for post-traumatic epilepsy have dramatically changed over the last 20 – 30 years. In assessing damages for post-traumatic epilepsy the courts {{are faced with a}} number of considerations: epilepsy can appear several years after the injury; epilepsy is not a homogeneous condition; the eventual prognosis is unknown; the epilepsy may not have been directly due to the trauma; and epilepsy affects life expectancy and employment. Damages were originally fixed at the point of compensation, and these rather crude calculations led to both over- and under-compensation. This situation was improved in 1985, when courts were permitted to award damages on the assumption that epilepsy would not occur or worsen, and further damages should these assumptions prove to be incorrect. The courts in England still depend, however, upon the evidence <b>of</b> expert <b>witnesses</b> chosen by the plaintiff and defendant. A tension thus exists between the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> expert <b>witnesses</b> to the court and the understandable inclination <b>of</b> expert <b>witnesses</b> to support the party that has instructed them. The Woolf report has led to changes in the responsibilities <b>of</b> expert <b>witnesses,</b> and will hopefully remedy many of the inconsistencies and inequities that occur...|$|R

50|$|Forensic psychiatrists {{are often}} {{called to be}} expert {{witnesses}} in both criminal and civil proceedings. Expert witnesses give their opinion about a specific issue. Often the psychiatrist will have prepared a detailed report before testifying. The primary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the expert <b>witness</b> is to provide an independent opinion to the court. An expert is allowed to testify in court with respect to matters of opinion only when the matters in question are not ordinarily understandable to the finders of fact be they judge or jury. As such, prominent leaders {{in the field of}} forensic psychiatry, from Thomas Gutheil to Robert Simon and Liza Gold and others have identified teaching as a critical dimension in the role <b>of</b> expert <b>witness.</b> The expert will be asked to form an opinion and to testify about that opinion, but in so doing will explain the basis for that opinion which will include important concepts, approaches, and methods used in psychiatry.|$|R

40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} the importance <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, {{but the same}} is not true <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Historically, the corporate law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. I hope to show that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has the duty to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any <b>of</b> the individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Rather, I will defend the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced.
