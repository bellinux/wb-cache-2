The commonly used analytical expressions are given classically for energies down to ~ 1 keV. An empirical equation for the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>range</b> {{of electrons}} in condensed matter has been formulated.

40|$|<b>Extrapolated</b> <b>range</b> {{values for}} {{homogeneous}} electron beams derived from an electrostatic generator, over the energy range 0. 25 - 0. 75 MeV, have been measured in aluminium, {{and four other}} metals, covering the range of atomic number 4 - 79, by two methods. Current collection range values in aluminium appear significantly lower than values obtained with other detectors, such as geiger counters and ionisation chambers with good geometry, but the extrapolation of ionisation-in-depth curves in aluminium yields range values in good agreement with accepted figures. Universal transmission curves and extrapolated range-energy curves for Be, Al, Cu, Ag and Au by current collection, and universal curves for Al and Ag from ionisation-in-depth curves are presented. The former curves are taken in carefully standardised geometrical conditions, the effect of suppressing low energy secondary emission and of varying collector geometry on range values having been assessed. The previous work on <b>extrapolated</b> <b>range</b> values in metals is reviewed, and the region of applicability of the extrapolation procedure appears to be greater with current collection methods than had been assumed in previous work with other detectors. Comparison of ionisation-in-depth curves with theoretical energy dissipation distributions for equivalent plane geometries has been made, and good agreement found. By comparing the data obtained with other results in equivalent geometrical conditions, an attempt {{has been made to}} assess an inferred slight dependence of range values upon the nature of the detector...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} {{solution}} to combat range anxiety in electric vehicles (EV). Range anxiety was defined as the fear that the driver will not reach their destination and is a major barrier to increase EV uptake worldwide. Parameter and state of charge (SoC) estimation for the Revolve NTNU battery cell were done using an enhanced self-correcting (ESC) battery model in combination with a dual Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Next, a method was developed to extract high resolution elevation data from a given Google Maps route. This elevation information was then attached to three different speed profiles and passed as an argument into an algorithm which calculated a SoC estimate. The algorithm used vehicle modelling equations along with the dual EKF to estimate SoC, as well as <b>extrapolated</b> <b>range</b> and time to go until battery pack depletion. Range results comparing the simulation to a real Chevy Volt using the same speed profiles showed a 23 % error. The validation of the range algorithm required a different battery cell, which made it impossible to use the dual EKF tuned to the Revolve cell for SoC estimation. Instead, coulomb counting (CC) was implemented in SoC estimation for the validation section. In addition, tests using three different elevation profiles concluded that topography had a major influence on <b>extrapolated</b> <b>range.</b> Lastly, different situations were observed where the EKF had superior SoC estimation performance compared with CC. More focus on speed profile generation will enable future EV users to use their GPS to estimate range more accurately and thereby help alleviate range anxiety...|$|E

30|$|To {{estimate}} radioimmunotherapeutic {{applications for}} 90 Y- or 177 Lu-labelled mutants, biodistribution data obtained with 111 In-CHX-A″ DTPA-labelled antibodies {{were used to}} generate time-activity curves for the calculations of predictive radiation doses for the bone marrow, liver, kidneys and tumour. Identical biodistribution and biologic clearance of 111 In-, 90 Y- and 177 Lu-labelled antibodies were assumed. Predictive dosimetric analysis was also done for 131 I-labelled antibodies based on biodistribution data obtained with 125 I-labelled antibodies. As radiation absorbed doses are proportional to %ID/g, time-activity curves for the blood, liver, kidneys and tumour were integrated over time to calculate area under the curve (AUC). Time-activity curves generated from biodistribution data were corrected for radiodecay. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic values calculated from such data refer to pharmacological values of the antibodies {{in the absence of}} radioisotope. Appropriate physical half-life corrections were applied to convert %IDpharmacological/g to %IDradioisotope/g, and the time-activity curves were fit to either a two or three exponential function from which the AUC is determined for 90 Y, 177 Lu and 131 I. AUC integration from zero to infinity was done by the sum of a trapezoidal integration of the measurement range (AUC 0 – 288  h) plus an extrapolated model fit for the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>range</b> (AUC 288  h–∞). To calculate accumulated activity, photon dose and edge effects were ignored. Dose to red marrow was determined from blood concentrations using a baseline value of 0.1 [21].|$|E

An effective solution is to set a threshold, on time or CPU usage, and terminate transactions that exceed the threshold. Threshold should be chosen so that only a small proportion of normal transactions will exceed it. How to choose the threshold? Our approach: obtain data for a large number n of normal transaction events, use the data to estimate the event magnitude that has a specified small exceedance probability δ (typically δ < 1 /n, so we will need to <b>extrapolate</b> beyond <b>range</b> of data). This approach can be applied to many other problems that involve frequency estimation for rare events...|$|R

ROAMS models {{a wide range}} of rover systems and provides a user interface to a simulated rover. The wheel-terrain interaction is of primary interest during rover motion over rough terrain. The wheel-terrain contact model must provide physically realistic behavior without being too computationally intensive for real-time simulation. Physically realistic behavior may be defined using empirical data and ROAMS provides mechanisms for tuning the contact model parameters to match this data. In cases where empirical data is non-existent or there are large amounts of uncertainty, ROAMS can be used to <b>extrapolate</b> a <b>range</b> of behaviors based on physical parameters.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{dependence of}} the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>ranges</b> of electrons on the detector characteristics has been investigated by two methods. These experiments were performed under well standardised geometrical conditions, employing electron beams (0. 25 - 0. 75 MeV) derived from a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator. The possible effects of poor geometry and small bias voltages on range values have also been investigated, but {{the results show that}} these effects could be kept very small in normal transmission measurements. The range values obtained in five metals (Be, Al, Cu Ag and Au) and in four dielectrics (glass, mica, sulphur and polystyrene) by direct current collection method and in A 1, Ag and mica by an ionisation method, show that the latter method yields larger range values. A comparison with other results showed that the range values obtained with the Geiger counter are also greater than those obtained by the current collection method, The ionisation-in-depth results in Al showed good agreement with the other results, and with Spencer's theory for equivalent source geometry. A universal transmission curve was obtained for each element using the true range values calculated from the Bethe-Bloch stopping power formula, and its intercept was found to be a smooth function of the atomic number for both metals and insulators. Electron bombardment conductivity has been studied primarily in sulphur and in selenium for comparison. Large current gains were observed in sulphur in confirmation of von Hippel's theory of the conductivity of the elements of Group VIb of the periodic table. The single crystals of sulphur showed as much bombardment conductivity as selenium, but much greater conductivity than the polycrystalline specimen, as was noted by Joffe (1928) and as would be expected for a more perfect crystal lattice.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of SFP designs {{comes with the}} use of range-finding reticles such as mil-dot. Since the proportion between the reticle and the target is dependent on selected magnification, such reticles only work properly at one magnification level, typically the highest power.

Some SFP scopes take advantage of this aspect by having the shooter adjust magnification until the target fits a certain way inside the reticle and then <b>extrapolate</b> the <b>range</b> based on the power adjustment. Some Leupold hunting scopes with duplex reticles allow range estimation to a Whitetail Buck deer by adjusting magnification until the area between the backbone and the brisket fits between the crosshairs and the top thick post of the reticle.
