As {{he is about to}} tell her, Central Perk manager Gunther (James Michael Tyler) confesses his love for Rachel. Back at Monica and Chandler's apartment, Ross decides not to tell Rachel, for fear of rejection. She prepares to leave to catch her flight, but waits long enough for Monica and Chandler to return with the twins, named Erica (after their {{biological}} mother) and Jack (after Monica's father).

5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him. Thomas discovers that Pandora has been cheating on him, and while high on JJ's medication, Cook reveals to Freddie that Effy loves Freddie and not him. In Effy's episode, she has nothing: her Queen Bee status has been usurped by Katie, sex with Cook means nothing, and her home life is a wreck. She finally feels something when she has sex with Freddie, but after being tormented by Katie, an intoxicated Effy hits her with a rock. Katie is recovering in 'Katie and Emily' but her relationship with her sister is falling apart. However, at the college ball, Emily is able to assert herself and Naomi confesses she loves Emily back.

Snake asks how <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> {{the people who died}} saving him, but the President only offers half-hearted regret. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers Snake a job, which he refuses. The President's speech commences, and he offers the contents of the cassette; to his embarrassment, the tape is Cabbie's cassette of the swing song [...] "Bandstand Boogie".

Weaver reflected on the song [...] "Saturday Night" [...] as being about [...] "my 17 year old Saturday night" [...] which consisted of {{going down to the}} Parkside Inn, drinking, and [...] "watching the bitches on the corner" [...] and that the song was not meant to be taken literally, but that he [...] "did come home once with a girl and I forgot my key and my mom was pissed off, but she didn't pull a gun; she's never owned a gun in her life".|$|E

Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he makes about Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader what Mr. H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than to explain to them what <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise."

The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going to worry about it.

500|$|The {{first season}} {{introduces}} the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after {{running away from}} her wedding to her fiancé Barry and moves into an apartment with her friend Monica from high school.

500|$|A loose story arc that {{informed}} the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding {{the destruction of}} his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] showed the audience why his Doctor {{is the way he}} is and [...] "how <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> his past". Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he [...] "strides through the universe wearing a dark leather jacket saying [...] "Don't touch me"". Davies felt that [...] "Dalek" [...] provided a [...] "bit of therapy" [...] and after this he [...] "starts to rebuild himself". In the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies felt it was important to take the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose. John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is [...] "letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|The two visit Loretta in her {{own room}} and find out that she feels guilty for {{cheating}} on him with Quagmire, and believes she can {{never go back to}} Cleveland. Later, Cleveland visits Brian to clear any negative feeling he has against him and Carolyn, as they are at [...] "a point of great soreness", but then Cleveland announces to Brian plans to elope with Carolyn in Hawaii, which makes their friendship tense. Just as Cleveland leaves, Loretta appears out of nowhere. Loretta apologizes to Cleveland for her affair with Quagmire, she then announces that she wants to get their family back together and promises she'll never betray him again. Cleveland goes to Peter and Lois for advice on what should be done. Peter and Lois think Cleveland shouldn't go back to Loretta, but Brian (seeing this as his only chance at getting back with Carolyn) says Cleveland should [...] "forgive and forget", and points out Loretta's good qualities (which he's obviously lying, as his nose starts to grow). Cleveland decides to talk to Loretta tomorrow to see how <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> getting back together with her. Thinking Loretta hasn't changed, Peter recruits Quagmire to have sex with Loretta again so Cleveland can see she hasn't changed. Quagmire meets her at the hotel she's staying in, but this time, Loretta resists his advances and tells him to beat it after smashing him in the face with an iron. When Cleveland shows up to her hotel room, Cleveland forgives her, but insists that {{it is time for the}} both of them to move on while Loretta lives her life as amazing and wonderful as she can. Cleveland finally leaves as Loretta tearfully watches on. When Cleveland visits Carolyn, he finds her and Quagmire having sex, apparently the same way it happened to Brian. Since both Brian and Cleveland have been cheated on by the same woman, Cleveland apologizes to him for stealing Carolyn and they make amends, with the former revealing himself to have received a genital wart.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

Forrestal's primary concern was not the resurgence of a militarized Japan, but rather [...] "the menace of Russian Communism and its attraction for decimated, destabilized societies in Europe and Asia," [...] and, therefore, keeping the Soviet Union out of the war with Japan. So strongly did <b>he</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> this matter that he cultivated negotiation efforts that some regarded as approaching insubordination.|$|R
