40|$|To {{what degree}} are audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with {{publicly}} traded equity higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar firms with private equity? The answer is potentially important for evaluating regulatory regime design efficiency and for understanding audit demand and production economics. For U. S. firms with publicly traded debt, we hold constant the regulatory regime, including mandated issuer reporting and auditor responsibilities. We vary equity ownership and thus public securities market contextual factors, including any related public firm audit fees from increased audit {{effort to reduce}} audit litigation risk and/or pure litigation risk premium (litigation channel effects). In cross-section, we find that audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> public equity firms are 20 - 22 % higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar private equity firms. Time-series comparisons for firms that change ownership status yield larger percentage <b>fee</b> increases (decreases) <b>for</b> those going public (private). Results are consistent with litigation channel effects giving rise to substantial incremental audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with public equity ownership...|$|R
