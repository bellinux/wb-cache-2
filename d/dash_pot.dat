40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{numerical}} simulations {{of the flow}} in a three-dimensional axisymmetric poppet valve are conducted using a vortex method. The fluids are assumed inviscid and incompressible. The vibration of the poppet, supported by a spring and a <b>dash</b> <b>pot,</b> occurs in the axial direction in some range of parameters. The numerical simulations are carried out by varying systematically {{the parameters of the}} calculation, namely the supply pressure, the spring constant, the mass of the poppet and the conical angle of the poppet. The process of jet flow development, the fluctuations of the valve lift and the velocity distributions in the valve are investigated for the poppet vibrating. 1 Introduction At the present time, poppet valves are universally used as a control valve for hydraulic and pneumatic power applications. Because of the interest in the flow inside the poppet valve, there have been several studies of the flow in the valve by numerical simulations (Itoh et al. [6], Tsukiji [ [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to calculating hydraulic conductivity within an aquifer via inversion of vertical seismic profile (VSP) data is tested {{in the field and}} compared to results from standard pumping tests. This approach is accomplished through the mathematical mapping of the damping ratio from the traditional Kelvin-Voigt (KV) model (one spring, mass, and <b>dash</b> <b>pot)</b> describing soil response, to the Kelvin-Voigt-Maxwell-Biot (KVMB) model (one spring, two masses, and a dashpot positioned between the two masses). The KVMB dashpot describes the viscous damping associated with the relative motion of the sediment or grains in the aquifer (hereafter referred to as frame) and fluid masses. The case with which fluid is able to move independently from the frame, when subjected to seismic waves, is dependent on the permeability of the aquifer, and thus, the hydraulic conductivity. Seismic data from 18 wells at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (an unconsolidated fluvial aquifer) are processed and analyzed. A low-velocity layer is identified with focusing of wave energy seen toward the bottom of this layer, producing anomalous damping and damping ratio values. Further processing for determination of hydraulic conductivity must begin in the region below this boundary, where inelastic decay dominates. Hydraulic conductivity values determined with this method range from 0. 285 to 1. 9 cm/s, with a mean value between all wells of 1. 06 cm/s. These values are about one order of magnitude larger than the nonunique solutions determined from the pumping tests. Contour maps are generated from this study, as well as from pumping tests, for comparison of results. Error analysis for the seismic results is performed for a 95 % confidence interval...|$|E
40|$|The Mars Exobiological Penetrator will be {{imbedded}} into several locations on the Martian surface. It contains various scientific instruments, {{such as an}} Alpha-Particle Instrument (API), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Evolved Gas Analyzer (EGA) and accelerometers. A sample is required for analysis in the API and DSC. To avoid impact contaminated material, this sample must be taken from soil greater than 2 cm away from the penetrator shell. This study examines {{the design of a}} dedicated sampling system including deployment, suspension, fore/after body coupling, sample gathering and placement. To prevent subsurface material from entering the penetrator sampling compartment during impact, a plug is placed in the exit hole of the wall. A U-lever device is used to hold this plug in the penetrator wall. The U-lever rotates upon initial motion of the core-grinder mechanism (CGM), releasing the plug. Research points to a combination of coring and grinding as a plausible {{solution to the problem of}} dry drilling. The CGM, driven by two compressed springs, will be deployed along a tracking system. A slowly varying load i. e., springs, is favored over a fixed displacement motion because of its adaptability to different material hardness. However, to accommodate sampling in a low density soil, two <b>dash</b> <b>pots</b> set a maximum transverse velocity. In addition, minimal power use is achieved by unidirectional motion of the CGM. The sample will be transported to the scientific instruments by means of a sample placement tray that is driven by a compressed spring to avoid unnecessary power usage. This paper also explores possible modifications for size, weight, and time as well as possible future studies...|$|R
40|$|First {{received}} June 1994; {{accepted in}} revised form August 1995) Abstract [...] The filtration and expression behaviour {{of sewage sludge}} is discussed. Due to the increase of costs for controlled umping and transport and more severe environmental legislation the need for decreased sludge volumes is rising. Filtration and expression are the cheapest dewatering operations and it is therefore desirable to remove the maximal feasible amount of water by mechanical dewatering. High dry solids contents of 35 - 40 wt % can already be reached at pressures of 300 - 400 kPa and optimal flocculation conditions; however at pressures of 6 [...] 10 MPa dry solids contents of 60 wt % can be reached. Further the modelling of the dewatering is discussed; model and experiment show acceptable agreement.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a nondestructive damage evaluation methodology that can identify simultaneously both stiffness and damping changes in a structure. Two approaches are used to meet the stated objectives. First, a method is developed on the basis of the conservation of total energy; second, the other method utilizes the acceleration-structural parameters (stiffness and damping) sensitivities. The total energy in a system consists of the sum of the kinetic energy, the potential energy, and the dissipated energy. In the second approach, a baseline structure is first identified. A baseline structure is defined to be a structural system having a similar dynamic response to the existing structure with no damage. In this study, natural frequencies and modal damping values are used to identify the baseline structure. The performance of the developed methodology is validated using several numerical experiments; Two classes of structures are considered here: (1) a high-rise building modeled as shear beams and (2) a two-span continuous beam structure. In the shear beam model of the structure, the damping damage is simulated by increasing the Newtonian <b>dash</b> <b>pot</b> constant which models the dissipation at the damaged story. For the two-span continuous beam structure, it is assumed that damping of the undamaged structure can be modeled using a proportional damping matrix. The damping matrix of the damaged structure is modeled as the combination of a proportional damping matrix of the undamaged structure and a stiffness proportional damping matrix of the damaged element. Three damage cases are investigated for each of the two structures considered here. Only one element experiences damping damage for the first damage scenario. In the second damage scenario, both stiffness damage and damping damage are simulated with different severities in one element of the model. In the third damage scenario, two elements are simulated with stiffness damage and damping damage, to verify whether or not the developed methodology works for multi-damage cases. The proposed method is modified to use mode shapes and the modified proposed method is applied to experimental data to identify stiffness damage in a R/C structure...|$|E
