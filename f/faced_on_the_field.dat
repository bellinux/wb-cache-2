50|$|In April 1942 Osasto Uimonen (ad hoc squad, {{size of a}} company) {{was formed}} from SissiOs./5.D, SissiOs./17.D and Osasto Vehniäinen, the squad was named after the {{commander}} of SissiOs./5.D Lieutenant E.A. Uimonen. They had an order to destroy a Soviet logistic centre, similar mission as Osasto Honkanen's highly successful destruction patrol to Petrovo-Jam's (Petrovskij Jam) logistics centre couple of months earlier. April 11 the squad was divided in two groups, as {{the plan was to}} surprise the Soviet troops in the front from both flanks. The group led by Lieutenant Uimonen faced the enemy soon and destroyed targeted squad, but they soon realised that they have been flanked by outnumbered enemy. The squad lost 7 men in the following battle, including Second Lieutenant V.J. Arponen and squadleader Uimonen, who stayed behind his withdrawing men with two volunteers to hold the enemy. The intel they had suggested the enemy strength on the area to be a platoon, but in reality Soviets had a whole battalion there. The Soviet troops Osasto Uimonen <b>faced</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> were in fact preparing for a surprise attack, which they launched on the same day. After the mission failed and SissiOs./5.D lost all its acting officers it was subordinated to Kevyt osasto 19 (KevOs 19) and took part to frontline battle in the Šemenski-Pertjärvi area until the end of April and Finnish defensive victory.|$|E
40|$|The main {{argument}} of the dissertation is structured around {{the relationship of}} innovation and modularity with a special focus on innovation openness. This research took a grasp in understanding the context, the classics, story of Italian design, and Made in Italy {{at the same time}} exploring design today: based on a field work in Milan, Lombardy. Case study method proved to be as most suitable for answering the explorative nature of this research. The approach was thus relying on secondary data, desk research and observation for understanding the context both from the angle of tradition and current discourse, as for reaching the next level: collecting cases worth to pursue. The cases presented were chosen to elucidate the targeted questions, and to open the path for further research. However, obstacles <b>faced</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> narrowed the cases covered, and the breadth of the investigation of each case study. Limitations in data access did not allow going beyond the story, I had to rely on what was constructed by the company itself. Despite these obstacles the analysis benefited from the perspective of communication and branding: it made possible to investigate a complex innovation effort. This proved to be a valuable insight, since design-driven industries are driven by producing meanings, forming the discourse where communication plays a key role. This work explores what modularity means in production opening up the perspective toward the aesthetic and semantic realm of production of goods. Furthermore in search for the locus of innovation it examines the relationship of modularity, innovation and openness. By exploring architectural innovation [Henderson and Clark 1990] I found that core design concepts that define the direction of technological improvements enter the conceptual frame of innovation: •	What was interpreted as ‘values’ by the company defining the design are proven to be core design concepts in the conceptual frame, as they define here a technological and conceptual [stylistic] frame. •	Thus, architecture draws here a semantic and aesthetic frame of conveying meanings. [Not just merely defining the technological construction of the artifact described by the interaction of the elements]. •	Procedural innovation [coined by me]: the effort that evolves around the main objective to most efficiently elaborate on the core design concepts in technological, and semantic realms. Further findings of the case studies suggest that open methodology of design and innovation is prone to come from third parties to established firms: •	open design methodology as a communication strategy that contributes to innovation practices of the company, and not as a conscious strategy coming from the other way round. Here technological and communication tools are intertwined, as they are conveying meanings defined by the core design concepts •	Firms in need for raising their capacities and reshaping organizational routines to innovate turn to third parties in the Knowledge-Intensive Business Services •	elucidate hybrid forms of innovation Adding to theory The above-mentioned empirical findings were backed by a concise summary on: •	open/ user/ collaborative innovation scholarship •	links between modularity and innovation •	and understanding the relationship of modular design in the history of design and architecture; also elaborating the: •	Semantic frame of innovation: where the product is an architecture of meanings •	Framework for understanding stylistic realm of conveying meanings and innovation •	Linking modular design of products as a conceptual approach [aesthetics] and linking it to production from an evolutionary perspective Adding empirical insights to be considered for •	Organizational theory: namely redefining the boundaries of the firm •	Innovation openness: based on the locus of innovation •	Modularity: apart from focusing on production, organization and that modular construction of goods has also a conceptual meaning (conceptually exploring the relationship of modular design and integrality with examples from architecture and classics of Italian design). Considering goods as an architecture of meanings and firms producing brands rather than goods, it draws on the implications of arrangement of production. ...|$|E
40|$|Like much of Western Sydney, the Penrith Panthers {{league team}} was often sneered at by big-city sophisticates, argues David Burchell SYDNEY’S {{football}} pundits severely underestimated the Penrith Panthers, the premier sporting {{representatives of the}} city’s west, on Sunday night. Pundits usually do. The game’s defining moment came when lumbering Penrith lock Scott Sattler, the archetypal journeyman, somehow ran down his opponents’ fastest player, then pulled him neatly into touch. A veteran of several minor regional teams, Sattler had played two seasons with the club he <b>faced</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> on Sunday without scoring a single appearance in the first-grade run-on side. But there were no cool-dude high-fives; he just packed without fanfare into the scrum. Very Penrith. Nearly every commentator in Sydney’s two daily newspapers had picked the team officially called the Sydney Roosters (but known to every football follower simply as Easts, in recognition of their prior name and geographical location) as big winners in Sydney’s footballing finale. One respected commentator even explained - apparently by algebra - how the Penrith Panthers couldn’t win, as if football was a compound equation. Penrith were described as likeable underdogs with a watchable but unsophisticated, ‘helter-skelter’ style of play. Their opponents, the Roosters, on the other hand, were rugby league virtuosos, a class act. The facts that Penrith had dominated the competition {{for much of the}} year, that they’d finished first {{at the end of the}} regular season, and that they were very obviously (in that most elusive but invaluable of football terms) ‘on a roll’, were overlooked. As so often before, the city’s outer reaches were treated with foolish condescension. Strangers to Australia’s largest and most self-absorbed city often struggle to make sense of the rancorous inter-regional dramas that underlie its tumultuous social life. Every city, after all, has its richer suburbs and its poorer suburbs, the innocent visitor muses. Why do Sydneysiders behave as if their city’s social divisions were part of some larger, especially Sydney-ish, divine plan? Why do inhabitants of the city’s eastern half persist in treating ‘the west’ as if it’s a different city, a kind of undifferentiated mass of naive 1950 s suburban mores and values untouched by the inexorable march of cosmopolitan culture and sophistication? The answers to these questions say a lot about Sydney. But they say something about Australia’s present political and cultural schisms, too. Ever since the ’ 40 s, when the inhabitants of Sydney’s old inner-city first began rolling westwards in search of the good life on the suburban frontier, the city has thought of itself as divided into two unequal halves, with different destinies. Sophistication in the world city supposedly spread on the ocean air, flooding over the city’s east, wafting over its northern reaches, then ebbing southwards, but hitting a contrary weather front at some point to the west. But that front has shifted with bewildering speed. When the Parramatta Eels contested their first grand finals in the late ’ 70 s, Parramatta - a mere 15 km from the city’s CBD - was thought of as the epicentre of the west. Eels supporters were widely parodied as members of the Ugh-boot tribe, carriers of the flag of suburban dagginess, with bad haircuts and out-of-date flares. Nowadays Parramatta is a boom town and its residents are starting to experiment with home coffee machines and designer kitchens. When Penrith won their first (and until Sunday, last) premiership in 1991, quite a lot of Sydney’s residents still weren’t exactly sure where Penrith was. Though Penrith is as flat as a billiard table, the Panthers were called ‘the Mountain Men’, since people from the east and north at least knew where the Blue Mountains were. Nowadays Panthers World of Entertainment, the licensed club that supports the Panthers out of its palatial headquarters on the Nepean River, is the knowing Sydneysider’s byword for the supposedly oversized, tacky and gauche tastes of the city’s hinterland. Penrith has become the city’s new id. In recent years this apparently light-hearted contempt has acquired a new, more complicated twist. For, in fact, large tracts of the city’s west aren’t poor any more. Rather, they’re the refuge of the upwardly mobile tradespeople and young suburban families who ‘want something better’ for their children than they had. There’s a boom in those large, tidy housing estates that have sent the urban sociologists gaga in recent years with moral anxieties about ‘white flight’ and ‘walled towns’. A modest but increasing number of houses have two storeys and a swimming-pool and the Falcons are mutating into four-wheel drives. The innocent outsider might think this would help the image of the west. If anything, the reverse is true. Ever since the nation’s great trauma over the Tampa asylum-seeker stand-off in mid to late 2001, western Sydney has been tagged as the epicentre of the nation’s supposed heartlessness. Now that they’re doing better for themselves, the story goes, the denizens of the west just want to hide in their big backyards and reject the world. So far as Sydney’s opinion-makers are concerned, it often seems the poor and the battling are funny, but objects of solicitude. The striving and the self-respecting are just crass or plain reprehensible. It’s a fatal formula. First, drum into western Sydney residents for decades that they’re second-class citizens without class. Then parody their desire for security and stability as paranoia and xenophobia. Then lecture them about how they need to develop a social conscience - as if this is something that comes with a university education, or from watching subtitled movies on SBS. At times, one could be forgiven for thinking that our contemporary advocates of compassion and the social conscience don’t really want to convert anyone. They’d rather alienate them, the better to parade themselves as moral martyrs. Certainly, that seems to have been the formula in the great social cauldron of contemporary Sydney. Whatever one’s views on the great moral issues of the day, though, it has to be said plainly that suburban stalwarts of national security and ‘border protection’ are not morally deficient. They’re just morally different from their critics. The Sydney Roosters hail from the heartland of Sydney cosmopolitanism. They do television ads for men’s fragrances and model fashion for the newspapers. Why, they’re veritable metrosexuals. Yet you’d struggle to spot an Easts supporter who has regularly turned up to matches for more than a few years. Easts isn’t a football club so much as a smart idea. Penrith’s support has gone up and down like a yo-yo over the years. A couple of years ago locals used to heckle the then wooden-spooners on their training ground. But everyone in the outer west knows, when a battle like Sunday’s grand final comes up, where their loyalties lie. It’s primal, and not always pretty, but it makes sense. This is no Sydney eccentricity. Empathy for ‘the other’ and compassion for the suffering of distant lands are noble ideals. On the other hand, the advocates of these high global ideals not infrequently combine them with a summary contempt for the ordinary striving citizens of their own nation. If you look around you and see your best and staunchest friends in your own street, suburb and locality, on the other hand, your moral universe will be a concrete one, rooted in place. And you’ll view cosmopolitan idealism with a sullen scepticism. If our advocates of conscience don’t want to become, once more, an Easts to the Penrith of suburban nationalism, they’d better learn some new plays.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, from July 1581 to March 1595, {{analysing}} the role {{he played in the}} confessional politics of the period (both national and internation) and how a strong Catholic magnate affected the balance of power and wider policy decisions in Scotland. The thesis is a narrative, with comentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political events of the reign of James VI, including the relationship Huntly had with James VI and the wider repercussions thereof. Huntly returned to Scotland from France in July 1581, becoming a courtier and an adherent of Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox. He served a political apprenticeship to Lennox and was exposed to covert Catholic politicking, {{as well as to the}} nascent Jesuit mission in Scotland. After James was captured by the Ruthven Raiders in August 1582, Huntly entered politics in his own right, becoming influential in the opposition to the rithven regime. Huntly assisted in enforcing the regime change when James escaped from the Ruthven lords in June 1583, his loyalty to the king winning James's trust and close friendship - the dividends of which he reaped throughout his life. Huntly initially supported the new administration under James Stewart, earl of Arran and assiduously attended to his duties in both the locality and the central government. Following Arran's fall in November 1585, Huntly deliberately distanced himself from the Court and the new Anglophile government. He opposed the anglo-Scottish treaty which was concluded in July 1586 and worked hard to counter the rise of John Maitland of Thirlestane. For the first time, Huntly made contact with the European counter-Reformation in Apriland May 1586. The period June 1587 to April 1589 was marked by faction fighting between Huntly and Maitland, who were both instrumental in James' pursuit of diametrically opposed policies. The discovery of Huntly's covert correspondece with Spain in February 1589 made his Catholic politicking public, subsequently colouring the conflict vetween Maitland and Huntly with confessional politics. Events excalated until Huntly mustered troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of Brig o' Dee near Aberdeen, Although Huntly refused to meet <b>the</b> king <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Maitland's vitory was only parial. Brig o' Dee was not the manifestation of the politics of the Counter-Reformation in Scotland, but the productof years of faction fighting between Maitland and Huntly. The period of January 1590 to March 1595 was characterised by Hunrly's continuing influence at Court with marked favour from James and his bloodfeud with James Stewart, second earl of Moray. Huntly used his twin centres of influnce, the Court and power in the region, to fight a vivious and protacted bloodfeud with Moray and his faction. The interception of the Spanish Blanks at the end of 1592 brought confessional politics to bear on a purely secular bloodfeud. Political agitation from the Kirk and Stewarts caused James to commission an army under Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll to pursue Huntly in October 1594. The result was the battle of Glenlivet between Huntly and Argyll which came to represent the fight against Catholicism, although its root cause was Huntly's bloodfeud with Moray and the Stewarts. When James later raised his own army and marched north against Huntly, the early refused to <b>face</b> James <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and in March 1595 he voluntarily went into exile abroad. This ended the most active phase of huntly's participation in national and international politics; after his political rehabilitation in 1597, he no longer played an influential role in the king's domestic or foreign policies. Overall, the thesis agues that Huntly needs to be understood as a political faction leader, whose Catholicism was a tool he eomplyed to widen his political influence but not the determinant of all his actions...|$|R
