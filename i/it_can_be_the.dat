5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The {{most common cause of}} endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

It may occur in those who {{are known to have}} hypothyroidism when they develop another illness, but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first presentation of hypothyroidism. The illness is characterized by very low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

25|$|Cruelty to animals, {{also called}} animal abuse, animal neglect or simply animal cruelty, is the infliction by {{omission}} (animal neglect) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, {{regardless of whether}} the act is against the law. More narrowly, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as zoosadism.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{orthoreovirus}} {{does not}} really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to what a person might have when they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.|$|E

500|$|During {{daylight}} hours, drier {{air from}} aloft drifts {{down to the}} surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward.

Fiona Nicholson of Education Otherwise, a home-education support group, agreed with this assessment and said that 'frontline staff working to protect vulnerable children have also expressed disbelief that investing hundreds of millions in <b>IT</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best way to safeguard children'. Laming, however, said that Davies' assertion was a 'gross distortion of what is an intelligent application of technology aimed at ensuring every child benefits from the universal services'.

500|$|On 18 May 1968, Lennon {{summoned the}} other Beatles {{to a meeting}} at Apple Corps to {{announce}} {{that he was the}} living reincarnation of Jesus: [...] "I have something very important to tell you all.

500|$|A similar {{phenomenon}} to {{a weather}} front is the dry line, {{which is the}} boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences. [...] When the westerlies increase {{on the north side}} of surface highs, areas of lowered pressure will form downwind of north–south oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough. [...] Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. [...] A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture. [...] When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> focus of diurnal thunderstorms.|$|E

500|$|Section 1 of the Act inserts {{sections}} 43A to L {{into the}} Employment Rights Act 1996, titled [...] "Protected Disclosures". It provides that a disclosure which the whistleblower makes to their employer, a [...] "prescribed person", {{in the course}} of seeking legal advice, Ministers of the Crown, individuals appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose, or, in limited circumstances, [...] "any other person", is protected. In addition, the disclosure must be one which the whistleblower [...] "reasonably believes" [...] shows a criminal offence, a failure to comply with legal obligations, a miscarriage of justice, danger to {{the health and safety of}} employees, damage to the environment, or the hiding of information which would show any of the above actions. These disclosures do not have to be of confidential information, and this section does not abolish the public interest defence; in addition, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> disclosure of information about actions which have already occurred, are occurring, or could occur in the future. In Miklaszewicz v Stolt Offshore Ltd, the Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that the disclosure does not have to have been made after the Act came into force; it is sufficient for the dismissal or other persecution by the employer to have happened after that time.|$|E
