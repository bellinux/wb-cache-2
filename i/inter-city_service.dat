500|$|Very few railcars {{had been}} built for <b>inter-city</b> <b>service</b> in the United States since the 1950s; the last locomotive-hauled cars were an order of ten coaches built by Pullman-Standard for the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1965. An {{important}} exception was the Budd Metroliner electric multiple unit. This fleet of 61 cars had begun operation on the Northeast Corridor in 1969 under Penn Central and quickly gained acceptance with the traveling public, despite various engineering problems. Writing in the mid-1970s, railroad historian John H. White Jr. described them as [...] "Amtrak's brightest star." [...] In 1973 Budd still had the tooling in place from the Metroliner order, meaning that any new order derived from that design could begin almost at once.|$|E
