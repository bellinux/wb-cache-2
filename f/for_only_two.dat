5|$|Another {{conjecture}} is {{that the}} breed is descended from the 89horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. His attempted colonization of San Miguel de Gualdape (near the Santee River in South Carolina) failed, forcing the colonists to move, possibly to North Carolina. Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600colonists subsequently {{died as a result}} of desertion, disease, and an early frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind.|$|E
5|$|Boston manager Art Ross {{predicted}} that Thompson, now 35, would {{play for the}} Red Wings {{for at least another}} five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record in both of these seasons, although they made the playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32–41–12 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5–6, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon and Marie Louise {{remained}} married {{until his}} death, {{though she did}} not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again. The couple had one child, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles (1811–1832), known from birth as the King of Rome. He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> weeks. He was awarded {{the title of the}} Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21, with no children.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|Santos {{remained}} <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> games: a UEFA Champions League qualifying {{match against}} Copenhagen and the Primeira Liga opener against Leixões. He was sacked {{and replaced by}} José Antonio Camacho, who affirmed the club's presence in top European competition and guided them to second place. In October and November, Benfica was eliminated from the Taça da Liga and the Champions League respectively, securing a UEFA Cup berth by finishing third in the latter. Over the next three months, Camacho's team became increasingly erratic, qualifying for the Portuguese Cup semi-finals but losing crucial points in the league race.|$|E

While in Edinburgh Sarah {{had given birth to}} Henrietta on 19 July 1681 (O.S.).

5|$|The writers created Mahone's {{character}} in the second season so {{that there would be}} a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} a city {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, 13lumber vessels were beached. A 30mile (48km) {{portion of}} the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was washed away. A {{passenger}} train was blown over 100yards from the track, injuring many passengers. Many boats at the harbor and the wharfs in Lanark were wrecked. The local summer resort of Lanark Inn was blown into the Gulf of Mexico. Large portions of stores and pavilions in the city were damaged. At McIntyre, virtually the entire town was destroyed, except <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> mill boilers. The city of Curtis Mill was completely destroyed. Additionally, the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. A total of fifteen ships either destroyed or beached at Dog Island, including the Benjamin C. Cromwell and James A. Garfield. At least 15people were reported missing. Six drowning deaths were confirmed in association with this storm.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 season, Rolle started 33 games, in 24 {{of which}} he scored in double figures and in 11 {{of which he}} had double-doubles. He {{rejected}} more shots {{than anyone else in the}} WAC, averaging 2.1 blocks per game, and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing there <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> seasons. Rolle also posted averages of 8.4 rebounds per game, third in the WAC (behind Luke Babbitt of Nevada and Chis Oakes of San Jose State), and 13.9 points per game, 12th in the WAC. His field goal percentage was 51.1, tied with Babbitt for third in conference and behind Tai Wesley of Utah State and Ike Okoye of Boise State. At the conclusion of the season, Rolle was named to the Lefty Driesell All-America Defensive Team, All-WAC Defensive Team, All-WAC Second Team, and All-Louisiana Second Team. He graduated from Louisiana Tech with a bachelor's degree in sociology in March 2010, becoming the first person in his family to earn a degree.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, NSB {{started using}} Class 93 diesel {{multiple}} units on intercity trains, retiring the Di3. In March 2000, NSB announced {{the closing of}} several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible <b>for</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> percent of the traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT Røstad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so {{was among the first}} lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, El Concierto debuted and {{peaked at}} number {{two on the}} Billboard Top Latin Albums chart with the number one {{position}} being held by Selena's album Dreaming of You.

The record also peaked at number 45 on the Billboard 200 and number two on the Latin Pop Albums chart. Both the album and the video were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); the former for shipping 500,000 and the latter for shipping 50,000 copies. In Argentina, El Concierto debuted at {{number one on the}} Argentine albums chart and the album was certified 4 platinum by CAPIF for sales of 240,000 copies while the video received a platinum certification for sales of 8,000 copies. The album reached number two on the Chilean albums and was certified platinum in the country. It also achieved platinum status in Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Elsewhere, it was certified gold in Bolivia and Spain, double platinum in Venezuela, and triple platinum in Central America. El Concierto sold over two million copies within a year of its release.|$|E
