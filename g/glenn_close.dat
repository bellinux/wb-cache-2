5000|$|In the 101 Dalmatians {{animated}} series, Cruella was {{voiced by}} April Winchell , Tress MacNeille [...] "Fungus Among Us" [...] and Close But No Cigar" [...] episodes only. and {{was based on}} <b>Glenn</b> <b>Close's</b> portrayal from the live-action film, but with Betty Lou Gerson's design from the animated film. She is not seen wearing clothes made out of animals, nor smoked (although in the episodes [...] "Smoke Detectors" [...] and [...] "Hail to the Chief" [...] she did) and is totally sane. Her villainous plot in the show was to steal the Dearlys' farm from them, and using the puppies as a ransom, mainly because the old widow Smedly would not sell it to her and that her mother Malevola demands it. She is an archetypal corporate villain who will seize on any scheme to make money, including drilling oil from the swamp near Dearly farm (thereby polluting it), buying Kanine Krunchies and replacing the nutritious ingredients with sawdust and chalk or sending Jasper and Horace to drive out the owners of Mom and Pop's Grocery Store so she can buy it herself.|$|R
