5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part, the Reformed {{tradition}} did not modify the medieval {{consensus on the}} doctrine of God. God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and unchangeable. Reformed theologians such as Shirley Guthrie have proposed that rather than conceiving of God {{in terms of his}} attributes and <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as he pleases, the doctrine of God is to be based on God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{initially}} {{named the}} film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi {{changed the name}} to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, {{and put them into}} a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, Dussek and {{his wife}} began having serious marital troubles. In an account of {{uncertain}} veracity, {{it was reported that}} Sophia, who {{had fallen in love with}} another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.|$|E

It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that [...] "The Joker {{is such a great}} character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom.

Christy said, [...] "Avril {{would come in and}} sing a few melodies, change a word here or there."

In 1900, {{the former prime}} minister's remains were exhumed and transported to Madagascar, where they were interred in the family tomb constructed by Jean Laborde in the Isotry neighborhood of Antananarivo. French colonial governor General Gallieni and Rainilaiarivony's grandson both spoke at the funeral, which was heavily attended by French and Malagasy dignitaries. In his eulogy, Gallieni expressed esteem for {{the former prime minister}} in the following terms: [...] "Rainilaiarivony was worthy of leading you. In the years to come, will there be a monument erected in his memory? This should be an obligation for the Malagasy who will have the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|E
40|$|I {{will argue}} here that Einaudi's thought reveals an {{awareness}} {{that the question of}} <b>freedom</b> has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with two inter-related problems: the relation of individuals or communities with their respective limits and the question of going beyond these limits.

500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen."

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one.

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever {{they wanted to make}} The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{child poverty}} from a multidimensional perspective. The main {{goal is to}} apply a general methodology {{in order to measure}} child poverty as a deprivation of capabilities and achieved functionings. In the capability perspective, child poverty is intended as the lack of <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and <b>to</b> be what children have reason to value. Although the various approaches to conceptualising, defining and measuring poverty, several researchers underline the need for children to be separated from their adult nexus, and treated according to their own specificities. The case study is focused on Afghan children, and it is based on a survey carried out by Handicap International that took into consideration many dimensions of children’s wellbeing, including concepts that are usually missing in standard surveys.

5000|$|Alternatively, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau {{have argued}} that we gain civil rights in return for {{accepting}} the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some <b>freedoms</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate {{only to the extent}} that they fulfill their part of the agreement. According to Hobbes (in whose view government is not a party to the original contract) citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest.
