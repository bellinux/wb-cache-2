Emphasis is on air monitoring data and three types of bioassay data: the concentration of uranium in urine; the concentration of uranium in feces; and the externally measured content of uranium in the chest. Primary Reference <b>guidance</b> <b>levels</b> for prevention of chemical effects and limitation of radiation effects are selected based on a review of current scientific data and regulatory principles for setting standards. Generic investigation levels and immediate action levels are then {{defined in terms of}} these primary <b>guidance</b> <b>levels.</b> The generic investigation and immediate actions levels are stated in terms of radiation dose and concentration of uranium in the kidneys. These are not directly measurable quantities, but models can be used to relate the generic levels to the concentration of uranium in air, urine, or feces, or the total uranium activity in the chest. Default investigation and immediate action levels for uranium in air, urine, feces, and chest are recommended for situations in which there is little information on the form of uranium taken into the body. Methods are prescribed also for deriving case-specific investigation and immediate action levels for uranium in air, urine, feces, and chest when there is sufficient information on the form of uranium to narrow the range of predictions of accumulation of uranium in the main target organs for uranium: kidneys for chemical effects and lungs for radiological effects.

40|$|Prior to {{the present}} {{guidelines}} the assessment, by the Marine Institute {{on behalf of the}} Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, of the suitability of dredged materials for disposal at sea had employed provisional action levels as an aid to evaluation. These provisional action levels were based entirely on sediment chemistry. The responsible agencies have decided that these levels now need to be updated and formalised. The approach proposed in this document aims to provide an improved, and more integrated, assessment of the ecological risks associated with individual sediment dredging and disposal activities. It offers flexibility to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis and improves transparency of the decision-making process. The list of parameters to be assessed has been revised and methods for setting numerical guidance values in other countries have been reviewed. Ideally, <b>guidance</b> <b>levels</b> should comprise chemical and ecotoxicological data specifically relating to Irish sediments. In the absence of a comprehensive dataset for Irish sediments, proposed threshold <b>guidance</b> <b>levels</b> have been based on ecotoxicological data from other sources. Wherever possible, lower threshold guidance values have been based on existing Irish background levels of contaminants. Where background data do not exist for a particular parameter, ecotoxicologically-derived values, corresponding to expected no-effect levels, have been taken from reputable sources. Similarly, upper threshold <b>guidance</b> <b>levels</b> (i. e. levels at which effects may be expected) have been based on ecotoxicological data from reputable sources. The assessment strategy has been designed so that decisions concerning the acceptability of sediments for sea disposal will take into account a range of intrinsic and environmental factors i. e. the strategy adopts a Weight of Evidence approach. The guidance will be reviewed and revised as necessary, as more information becomes available. Sampling and storage methodology is presented as well as quality assurance and reporting requirements.

40|$|In {{a recent}} study {{published}} in Accident Analysis & Prevention, Vansteenkiste et al. (2013) - {{as one of the}} first in this field - investigated the visual control of bicycle steering. They undertook the interesting task of testing cyclists' eye fixation behaviour against Donges' two-level model of steering, i. e. the <b>guidance</b> <b>level</b> to anticipate alternations in the course of the road and the stabilization level for lane keeping. Although the laboratory experiment itself is well conducted, we believe that its results cannot be used to test the two-level model of steering as developed for driving. The test track was only 15 m long, was completely straight and was known in advance. Accordingly, it did not provide adequate conditions for testing the <b>guidance</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, as the experimental lanes were much narrower than real-world cycling lanes, the stabilization level differed considerably from that in the real world.

The sharp edge of a cavitator mounted on the nose of the vehicle creates a large pressure gradient at high velocity.

40|$|An {{approach}} to motion guidance, called virtual fixtures, {{is applied to}} admittancecontrolled human-machine cooperative systems, which {{are designed to help}} a human operator perform tasks that require precision and accuracy near human physical limits. Virtual fixtures create guidance by limiting robot movement into restricted regions (Forbidden-region virtual fixtures) or influence its movement along desired paths (Guidance virtual fixtures). An implementation framework for vision-based virtual fixtures, with an adjustable <b>guidance</b> <b>level,</b> was developed for applications in ophthalmic surgery. Virtual fixtures were defined intraoperatively using a real-time workspace reconstruction obtained from a vision system and were implemented on a scaled-up retinal vein cannulation testbed. Two human-factors studies were performed to address design considerations of such a human-machine system. The first study demonstrates that cooperative manipulation offers superior accuracy to telemanipulation in a Fitts’ Law targeting task; however, they are comparable in task execution time. The second study shows that a large amount of guidance improves performance in path-following tasks; however, it worsens the performance on tasks that require off-path motion. Gain selection criteria were developed to determine an appropriate <b>guidance</b> <b>level.</b> Control methods to improve virtual fixture performance in the presence of robot compliance and human involuntary motion were also developed. To obtain an accurate estimate of end-effector location, positions obtained at discrete intervals from cameras are updated with a robot dynamic model using a Kalman filter. Considering both robot compliance and hand dynamics, the control methods effectively achieve the desired end-effector position under Forbidden-region virtual fixtures and the desired velocity for Guidance virtual fixtures. An experiment on a one-degree-of-freedom compliant human-machine system demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed controllers. A compliance model of the JHU Eye Robot was developed to enable controller implementation on a higher degree-of-freedom humanmachine cooperative system. The presented research provides key insights for virtual fixture design and implementation, particularly for fine manipulation tasks. ...|$|E

40|$|A two-stage, clonal-expansion {{model of}} liver tumor risk in mice was {{developed}} by Kodell et al. (Food Addit Contam 18 : 237 – 253, 2001) based on the hypothesis that fumonisin B 1, a naturally occurring mycotoxin in corn, is not genotoxic, but rather causes cancer through the disruption of sphingolipid metabolism. This disruption is assumed to cause an increase in apoptosis, in response to which cells proliferate to compensate for reduced tissue mass. The resulting differential {{increase in the number}} of pre-neoplastic cells at risk of mutation during cell division is assumed to lead to an increase in the incidence of tumors. Two-year liver tumor incidences predicted by the model using data on organ weight, cell proliferation, and sphingolipid metabolism provided a reasonable match to the actual 2 -year observed incidences in a study conducted at the National Center for Toxicological Research. The predictions indicated no risk at low doses (even a possible hormetic effect) and high risk at high doses in females, as well as a complete absence of a dose response (or perhaps, a hormetic effect) in males.

This concept of the duality of the driver's steering activity led to a newly developed two-level model of driver steering behavior. Its parameters are identified on the basis of data measured in driving simulator experiments.
