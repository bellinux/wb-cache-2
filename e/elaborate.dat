40|$|Given {{the depth}} and breadth of {{available}} information, determining which components of an explanation are most important is a crucial process for simplifying learning. Two experiments tested whether people believe that components of an explanation with more elaboration are more important. In Experiment 1, participants gave higher importance scores for components that they judged to be <b>elaborated</b> upon by many other components. In Experiment 2, the amount and type of elaboration was experimentally manipulated. Experiment 2 demonstrated that elaboration increases {{the importance of the}} <b>elaborated</b> information by providing insight into understanding the <b>elaborated</b> information; information that was too technical to provide insight into the <b>elaborated</b> component did not increase the importance of the <b>elaborated</b> component. While learning an explanation, people piece together the structure of elaboration relationships between components and use the insight provided by elaboration to identify important components...|$|R

The vaults range from the simple quadripartite vault in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly <b>elaborate</b> forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) vault at Exeter, the similar vault with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more <b>elaborate</b> variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar vaulting of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan vaulting of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant vaulting of the choir at Oxford, where <b>elaborate</b> long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. Many of the more <b>elaborate</b> forms are unique to England, with stellar vaulting also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{reports on}} the results of a study {{designed}} to investigate the effects of two types of lexical modification i. e., lexical simplification and elaboration, on incidental vocabulary acquisition of Iranian EFL learners. To this end, four versions of experimental texts containing 20 target words were created: baseline and simplified versions, as well as <b>elaborated</b> version with two types, i. e., parenthetical <b>elaborated</b> and non-parenthetical <b>elaborated</b> version. ANOVA and Post Hoc analysis were run in order to analyze data obtained from 80 EFL students. Results of two immediate surprise tests, i. e., form recognition test and meaning production test measuring incidental vocabulary learning from modified target words revealed that (a) lexical simplification did not result in incidental vocabulary acquisition (b) both parenthetical and non-parenthetical elaboration were conducive to incidental vocabulary acquisition and (c) comparatively, parenthetical <b>elaborated</b> group outperformed non-parenthetical <b>elaborated</b> group on two incidental vocabulary measures. </p...|$|R

5|$|Parish church {{architecture}} in Scotland was often much less <b>elaborate</b> than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the highlands {{they were often}} even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, there were some churches built in a grander continental style. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often more <b>elaborate</b> before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-15th century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered {{some of the finest}} in the Gothic style. Late medieval Scottish churches also often contained <b>elaborate</b> burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E
