40|$|We have {{developed}} a homogeneous substrate-labeled fluorescent immunoassay for the measurement of <b>dibekacin</b> concentrations in serum and plasma. The fluorogenic enzyme substrate beta-galactosyl-umbelliferone was covalently attached to tobramycin, an aminoglycoside structurally similar to <b>dibekacin,</b> to prepare a fluorogenic drug reagent (FDR). The FDR is nonfluorescent under assay conditions, but fluoresces upon hydrolysis by beta-galactosidase. However, binding of the FDR by antiserum to the cross-reactive drug kanamycin prevents enzyme hydrolysis. The fixed level of FDR competes with <b>dibekacin</b> within the sample for the limiting number of antibody-binding sites in the reaction mixture. Unbound FDR is hydrolyzed by beta-galactosidase to release a fluorescent product that {{is proportional to the}} <b>dibekacin</b> concentration in the sample.

40|$|The {{role of the}} tubular {{reabsorption}} of aminoglycosides in nephrotoxicity was considered. The {{tubular reabsorption}} rate, fractional reabsorption, and net balance, expressed as the excreted to infused aminoglycoside ratio, were concomitantly studied in male rabbits by continuous infusion of gentamicin, netilmicin, <b>dibekacin,</b> and amikacin. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity was evaluated by creatinine levels in serum and pathological renal damage after 14 days of a low- or high-dose regimen, comprising either eight, hourly intramuscular injections of gentamicin, netilmicin, or <b>dibekacin</b> (4 mg/kg) or amikacin (16 mg/kg); twelve, hourly intramuscular injections of gentamicin, netilmicin, or <b>dibekacin</b> (15 mg/kg) or amikacin (60 mg/kg); or injections of saline for the control group. Aminoglycosides exhibited three degrees of tubular reabsorption: gentamicin had the highest, netilmicin had the lowest, and <b>dibekacin</b> and amikacin had intermediate degrees of reabsorption. Nephrotoxicity associated with alteration in renal histology was observed with gentamicin and, to a lesser extent, with <b>dibekacin</b> in the high-dose regiment. No nephrotoxicity was noted with netilmicin or amikacin compared with the control group. Concentrations of the aminoglycosides in renal cortex and serum were not predictive of renal toxicity. Except for amikacin, which appeared to exhibit the lowest intrinsic renal toxicity, nephrotoxicity was correlated with the tubular reabsorption of each aminoglycoside. It was concluded that aminoglycoside renal toxicity can be determined by two major factors: importance of transport into tubular cells and intrinsic intracellular toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} {{mechanisms of}} more than 2, 000 aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative aerobic bacteria were estimated by a method that assigned a biochemical mechanism based on susceptibility to selected aminoglycosides. Strains from hospitals in Japan, Formosa, and Korea (the Far East) were compared with strains from Chile and the United States. Of the strains from Chile, 90 % had an aminoglycoside resistance pattern indicative of the 3 -N-acetyltransferase [AAC(3) -V] enzyme. Of the strains from the Far East, 78 % had susceptibility patterns suggesting the presence of AAC(6 ') enzymes. In contrast, strains from the United States had {{a wider variety of}} resistance mechanisms including 2 ''-O-adenylyltidyltransferase [ANT(2 '') ], AAC(3), AAC(6 '), and AAC(2 '). Reflecting these differences in resistance patterns, the frequencies of resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, <b>dibekacin,</b> and amikacin in strains from the United States were different from those in strains from the Far East. These differences seem to be correlated with different aminoglycoside usage in the two regions. In the United States, where gentamicin was the most widely used aminoglycoside, 92 % of the strains were resistant to gentamicin, 81 % were resistant to <b>dibekacin,</b> and 8. 8 % were resistant to amikacin. In the Far East, <b>dibekacin</b> and kanamycin were widely used in the past and more recently amikacin has been frequently used.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>dibekacin,</b> a new aminoglycoside antibiotic, was {{studied in}} volunteers {{given the same}} dose (100 mg) intramuscularly on two separate occasions and intravenously at two different rates of infusion. The kinetic parameters (t 1 / 2, 2. 24 h, and Vd, 0. 136 liter/kg, as the overall mean) observed after intramuscular administration appear to be compatible {{with those of other}} aminoglycosides and fairly reproducible within the same individuals. <b>Dibekacin</b> was rapidly absorbed (tmax, 0. 84 h), yielding a peak level of 10. 4 microgram/ml after the 100 -mg intramuscular dose. After the 30 - or 60 -min infusion, the concentrations of <b>dibekacin</b> in serum fell bi-exponentially, giving an elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 beta) of 2. 50 to 2. 88 h. The highest serum levels after th 30 - and 60 -min infusions were 15. 2 +/- 0. 9 and 12. 1 +/- 1. 8 microgram/ml, respectively.

40|$|We {{developed}} a rapid, quantitative culture method {{to estimate the}} replication of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAIC) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells were plated in a 96 -well tray, infected with clinically isolated strains of MAIC {{in the presence of}} autologous plasma, and further cultivated for 1 to 2 weeks in a tissue culture medium. No MAIC cells proliferated extracellularly, since human plasma inhibited extracellular growth of the mycobacteria. The mononuclear cells were lysed through a brief treatment with alkali, and surviving intracellular mycobacteria were diluted and plated with tissue culture medium in a 96 -well tray. Mycobacterial colonies were counted under a microscope after a 5 -day incubation. The number of viable MAIC cells continuously increased, reaching 10 times the number of inoculated cells in a week. Thus, mononuclear phagocytes were the permissive site for the replication of MAIC. Intra- and extracellular susceptibilities of seven MAIC strains to four aminoglycoside antibiotics were then studied. The mycobacteria were most susceptible in vitro to <b>dibekacin</b> (MICs, 3. 13 to 12. 5 micrograms/ml). <b>Dibekacin</b> at 12. 5 micrograms/ml was bacteriostatic to five of seven strains in the monocytes. Also, intracellular replication of the other two strains was greatly suppressed by that concentration of <b>dibekacin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{antimicrobial}} activity of sporaricin A, a new aminoglycoside, was {{compared with that}} of amikacin, <b>dibekacin,</b> and gentamicin. Sporaricin A showed a broad spectrum of activity against various gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including amikacin-, dibekacin-, or gentamicin-resistant strains. Sporaricin A inhibited more than 90 % of clinical isolates of staphylococci, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, and Proteus, except for P. morganii and P. inconstans, at the concentration of 3. 13 microgram/ml. This activity, except for that against Serratia, was similar to that of amikacin. Against P. inconstans and S. marcescens, sporaricin A was more effective than amikacin, <b>dibekacin,</b> and gentamicin. However, its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was relatively weak in comparison with three other aminoglycosides. Sporaricin A was highly effective against bacteria that had various aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes and that were resistant to the other drugs tested, but it was not active against those with aminoglycoside 3 -acetyltransferase-I. The activity of sporaricin A tended to be greater with a reduction in inoculum size of bacteria and an increase in medium pH and decreased slightly in the presence of 10 to 50 % horse serum. The in vitro activity was confirmed by in vivo tests in experimental infections with various bacteria. Its protective effect seemed to be equal to or greater than that of amikacin or <b>dibekacin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus faecium BM 4102 was {{resistant}} to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics; tetracycline-minocycline; {{and high levels}} of kanamycin, neomycin, tobramycin, and <b>dibekacin</b> but not gentamicin. This aminoglycoside resistance phenotype is new in enterococci. The genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and MLS antibiotics in this strain were carried on a plasmid, pIP 810, that was self-transferable to to other Enterococcus strains. Resistance to tobramycin and structurally related aminoglycosides, kanamycin, neomycin, and <b>dibekacin,</b> was due to synthesis of a 4 ', 4 "-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase. Homology was detected by hybridization between pIP 810 DNA and a probe specific for a gene encoding an enzyme with identical site specificity in staphylococci. The bacteriostatic activity of amikacin apparently was not affected by the presence of the enzyme, although it was modified in vitro. However, the bactericidal activity of amikacin and the synergism of this aminoglycoside with penicillin were abolished...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the use of}} {{amikacin}} as {{the principal}} aminoglycoside at a Denver hospital, amikacin resistance appeared first in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and then in Escherichia coli, KkebsieUa pneumoniae, and other enteric organisms from debilitated and compromised patients who had spent time in intensive care units and who had been treated with multiple antibiotics, usually including amikacin. In a P. aeruginosa isolate, resistance to amikacin and tobramycin was transferable by the IncP- 2 plasmid pMG 77, while in E. coil and K. pneumoniae resistance was carried by the transmissible plasmids pMG 220, pMG 221, and pMG 222 belonging to the IncM group. Isolates and tranwonjugants produced an enzyme with adenylyltransferase activity with substrates having a 4 '-hydroxyl group, such as amikacin, kanamycin, neomycin, Sch 21768, isepamicin (Sch 21420), or tobramycin, but not with aminoglycosides lacking this target, such as <b>dibekacin,</b> netilmicin, sisomicin, or gentamicin C components.

40|$|Aminoglycosides {{are highly}} potent, broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} with many desirable properties {{for the treatment}} of lifethreatening infections (28).

In the 1970 s, the semisynthetic aminoglycosides <b>dibekacin,</b> amikacin, and netilmicin demonstrated the possibility of obtaining compounds which were active against strains that had developed resistance mechanisms towards earlier aminoglycosides as well as displaying distinct toxicological profiles (65).

40|$|The tubular {{disposition}} of five aminoglycosides was studied in humans {{to establish a}} possible relationship between tubular reabsorption and the nephrotoxicity that has been described in the literature. Thirty-three healthy male volunteers received a continuous intravenous infusion of isotonic saline with inulin, followed 1 h later by inulin plus gentamicin, <b>dibekacin,</b> tobramycin, netilmicin, or amikacin (1 mg/kg per h) or amikacin (4 mg/kg per h) {{over a period of}} 2 h. Brain-stem-evoked response audiometry was performed both before {{and at the end of}} each infusion. The latency of wave V remained constant whichever antibiotic was considered. The glomerular filtration rate did not vary significantly during the infusion of each drug. The percent fractional excretion was 79 +/- 6, 81 +/- 22, 85 +/- 5, and 99 +/- 9 for gentamicin, <b>dibekacin,</b> tobramycin, and netilmicin, respectively, and 83 +/- 4 and 124 +/- 13 for amikacin at concentrations of 1 and 4 mg/kg per h, respectively. Net balance and renal clearance were similar for the five aminoglycosides when administered at a rate of 1 mg/kg per h. With gentamicin only, fractional excretion was correlated with the urinary flow rate. We can conclude that (i) gentamicin, generally considered the most nephrotoxic agent, had the highest degree of net reabsorption; (ii) netilmicin exhibited a net zero tubular balance; (iii) amikacin had different patterns of tubular disposition according to the dose, i. e., reabsorption at 1 mg/kg per h and secretion at 4 mg/kg per h, raising the hypothesis of a saturable process of reabsorption; and (iv) these differences in tubular reabsorption could account at least in part for the known different nephrotoxic potentials of these five aminoglycosides in humans...|$|E

40|$|Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} induce {{an early}} and characteristic lysosomal phospholipidosis in cultured fibroblasts and in kidney tubular cells. We have recently demonstrated an inhibition of lysosomal phospholipases A 1 and A 2 by gentamicin and amikacin in vitro. In vivo, gentamicin decreases {{the activity of}} phospholipase A 1 (Laurent et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 31 : 3861 - 3870, 1982). In the present study, we examined 14 aminoglycosides for in vitro inhibition of phospholipases.

We measured the hydrolysis of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -[1 - 14 C]oleoyl phosphatidylcholine contained in the liposomes by a soluble fraction of highly purified lysosomes isolated from rat liver. Similar IC 50 S (concentrations causing 50 % inhibition of enzymatic activity) were observed for <b>dibekacin,</b> gentamicin (with no major difference between C 1, C 1 a, or C 2), netilmicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin B. Sisomicin was slightly more inhibitory. Kanamycin A, N 1 -(L- 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxy- 1 -oxobutyl) <b>dibekacin,</b> and amikacin showed increasing IC 50 S. Streptomycin caused the least inhibition. Octa- and tetramethylkanamycin A are much less inhibitory than the parent drug. These results point to the number, the nature, and the respective positions of the cationic groups as essential determinants in causing inhibition of phospholipid breakdown. The binding of three aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin, streptomycin) to the liposomes at pH 5. 4 was also measured by gel permeation and was found {{to be related to the}} respective inhibitory potency of each drug.

Cell viability was determined with the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 thiazoyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after cells had been exposed to the drugs for 48 h. The effects of preservatives on cell viability were also determined. Toxicity was compared using the cell viability score (CVS). Results: Based on results of the MTT assay and CVS, the order of cell viability after exposure to the antibiotic solutions was cefmenoxime &ge; tosufloxicin &ge; <b>dibekacin</b> &ge; levofloxacin &ge; norfloxacin = gatifloxacin = moxifloxacin. For the anti-inflammatory solutions, the order of cell viability was betamethasone &ge; betamethasone + fradiomycin &gt; preservative-free diclofenac &ge; preservative-free bromfenac &gt;&gt; 0. 02 % fluoromethorone &ge; 0. 1 % fluoromethorone = diclofenac + preservative = bromfenac + preservative = pranoprofen. The anti-inflammatory drugs were more toxic than the antibiotics. The toxicity of antibiotic drugs against ocular surface cells was dependent on the pharmaceutical components of the solution, whereas that of the anti-inflammatory drugs was dependent on both the pharmaceutical components and the preservatives. Conclusion: Postoperative drug-induced epitheliopathy may be caused primarily by anti-inflammatory drugs. CVS is useful in comparing the cytotoxicity of different drugs.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activities of}} K- 4619 (3 -de-O-methylsporaricin A sulfate) {{were compared with}} those of sporaricin A, amikacin, <b>dibekacin,</b> and gentamicin. K- 4619 exhibited a high order of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its activity against Providencia species and Serratia marcescens was the highest of all drugs tested. K- 4619 was highly effective against bacteria that produce various aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, except for 3 -acetyltransferase I. The bactericidal activity of K- 4619 was somewhat greater than that of amikacin. The activity of K- 4619 against gram-negative bacteria increased at alkaline pH and was hardly affected by inoculum size, addition of horse serum, and composition of the medium. The in vivo protective effect of K- 4619 against infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa in mice was greater than that of sporaricin A. K- 4619 was also active in mice infected with gentamicin- or amikacin-resistant strains bearing some of the aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel {{species of}} the genus Chryseobacterium which was {{isolated}} from soil, has been studied for resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals (lead, chromium, nickel, zinc, cadmium, copper, cobalt) and its capacities for bioaccumulation of lead and zinc. It exhibited high Minimal Inhibitory Concentration values for metal ions tested ranging from 75 ug/ml to 500 ug/, and antibiotic resistance to imipenem, cefuroxim, tetracyclin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, fusidic acid, fosfomycin, cefalotin, <b>dibekacin,</b> furans and nitrofurantoin. The strain was able of accumulate more than 90 % of lead and zinc during the active growth cycle. Study of pH effect on heavy metal removal indicated that the metal ions accumulation increased with increasing pH. Since, Chryseobacterium solincola could grow {{in the presence of}} significant concentration of toxic metals and because of its high metal accumulation capacity in aerobic conditions, may be potentially applicable in situ bioremediation of heavy metals contaminated aqueous or soil system...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasmid-coded aminoglycoside 2 "-O-nucleotidyltransferase [ANT(2 ") ] {{activity and the}} minimum inhibitory concentration for aminoglycosides was studied. ANT(2 ") was very unstable, and therefore, procedures for handling this enzyme were optimized. Escherichia coli L 58058. 1 producing ANT(2 ") was resistant to gentamicin, sisomicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and <b>dibekacin</b> but susceptible to netilmicin, amikacin, and neomycin. However, only amikacin and neomycin were not modified by ANT(2 "). A correlation between the substrate profile of the enzyme tested at 0. 15 mM and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the aminoglycosides could not be demonstrated. The substrate concentration-dependent enzyme activity curves {{proved to be a}} better alternative than a substrate profile based on tests at one concentration. At concentrations of greater than 10 (- 2) mM, ANT(2 ") demonstrated substrate inhibition that explains the discrepancy between ANT(2 ") activity and the minimum inhibitory concentrations. A close correlation was found between the physiological efficiency (Vmax/Km ratio) of ANT(2 ") and the minimum inhibitory concentrations for the enzyme-producing strain...|$|E
40|$|The {{tolerance}} of four strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to chlorhexidine increased 8 to 32 times during 21 passages {{every other day}} in nutrient broth containing subinhibitory concentrations of the disinfectant. The cells from the 30 th subcultures died more slowly in either 0. 5 or 0. 02 % solution of chlorhexidine {{than those of the}} parent strains. Likewase, the minimal inhibitory concentrations were greater with acrinol for the bacteria from the 30 th subcultures than for those of the parent strains. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed between the parent strains and those from the 30 th subcultures in minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, carbenicillin, <b>dibekacin,</b> amikacin, polymixin B and benzalkonium chloride. The bacteria that had acquired resistance after 30 subcultures in the presence of chlorhexidine were further subcultured for another 30 passages in a disinfectant-free nutrient broth. In three of the four strains tested, the acquired resistance to chlorhexidine was reduced to one-fourth to one-eighth, but it was unchanged in one strain...|$|E
