5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign {{culminated in the}} fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of religion}} in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism.

5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E

5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated {{in a similar fashion}} to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior.</b> The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.|$|E
