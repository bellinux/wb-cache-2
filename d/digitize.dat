5|$|Since Clough assumed office, he {{has made}} plans to <b>digitize</b> the Museum's collections, and offer more {{intensive}} K-12 educational programming. In November 2008, for the first time, the Smithsonian opened a board meeting to the public. Clough has made {{efforts to improve the}} Smithsonian's facilities and long-term planning, as well as plans to reorganize and cut back on staff and budget. In February 2012, Clough's travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E. Grassley, despite increased controls; Clough's travel must be approved by the Smithsonian's chief financial officer as part of the reforms enacted in the wake of alleged abuses by Secretary Small.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, 2010, the Detroit Public Schools {{announced}} that it wants to <b>digitize</b> all its teaching and learning {{as part of the}} comprehensive plan to accelerate student achievement, within five years. Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the district's chief academic and accountability auditor, said the district is investing in high-tech tools to equip all 6th- to 12th-graders with computers and <b>digitize</b> all curriculum, textbooks and lessons plans district-wide. The $15 million product is part of a $40 million contract with Boston's Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which marks the largest single deal for the book publisher.|$|E

40|$|A pre-refereeing version {{submitted}} to DGCI 2017. Euclidean rotations in R^ 2 are bijective and isometric maps, but they lose generally these properties when <b>digitized</b> in discrete spaces. In particular, the topological and geometrical defects of <b>digitized</b> rigid motions {{on the square}} grid have been studied. In this context, the main problem {{is related to the}} incompatibility between the square grid and rotations; in general, one has to accept either relatively high loss of information or non-exactness of the applied <b>digitized</b> rigid motion. Motivated by these considerations, we study <b>digitized</b> rigid motions on the hexagonal grid. We establish a framework for studying <b>digitized</b> rigid motions in the hexagonal grid [...] -previously proposed for the square grid and known as neighborhood motion maps.

With the wide availability of ortho-rectified imagery (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up <b>digitizing</b> is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up <b>digitizing</b> involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate <b>digitizing</b> tablet (heads-down <b>digitizing).</b>|$|R

Church records also contain information on personal ordinances of members as well as vicarious temple ordinances such as baptism, endowment, and sealing to spouse, parent, and child. Genealogical and church related information is maintained in permanent storage in the Granite Mountain vault in the Wasatch Range of the Utah mountains. The church is currently working to <b>digitize</b> all of these records and make them more readily available.|$|E
25|$|Small {{portions}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls collections {{have been put on}} temporary display in exhibitions at museums and public venues around the world. The majority of these exhibitions took place in 1965 in the United States and the United Kingdom and from 1993 to 2011 in locations around the world. Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works to <b>digitize</b> the scrolls and place them in permanent cold storage.|$|E
25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} bypass most of {{the peripheral}} auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions {{in response to the}} movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the cochlear nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and <b>digitize</b> it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.|$|E

In 2011, the NAACP teamed with the digital repository ProQuest to <b>digitize</b> and host online the earlier portion of its archives, through 1972 nearly two million pages of documents, from the national, legal, and branch offices throughout the country, which offer first-hand insight into the organization's work related to such crucial issues as lynching, school desegregation, and discrimination in all its aspects (in the military, the criminal justice system, employment, housing).|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{the game}} was {{designed}} to be played solely online and to mimic the feel of physical cards to make it more accessible to new players. Dodds found that past attempts to <b>digitize</b> physical card games by other companies left areas they felt were lacking, and wanted to improve on that experience. One particular example are card games where players have the ability to react to other players; Dodds noted that when playing in the same room as another player, these types of interactions are straightforward, but consume {{a great deal of time}} in a virtual space. Hearthstone was designed to eliminate any gameplay from the opponent during the player's turn, streamlining the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} will be {{interactive}} Web-based portal called Learning Village {{that would be}} fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability to <b>digitize</b> its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. Teachers {{will have access to}} students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents can log into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is to serve as a unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents and principals, and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6–12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is setting up a Detroit-based office with at least 13 employees for technical support, training and outreach. Detroit is the company's largest client.|$|E
