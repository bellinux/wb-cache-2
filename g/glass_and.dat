In vitro bioactivity of bioactive <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> - ceramics, {{before and}} after exposed to simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for different time periods, were investigated by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) reflectance spectrometer with measuring the pH and the concentrations of silicon, sodium, calcium, phosphorus and zinc ions in SBF solution. The density, micro hardness and flexural strength of bioactive <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> - ceramics were measured. Experimental results show that in vitro bioactivity nearly remains same by doping 1 % of ZnO by weight, but after {{that as well as}} ZnO content increases in vitro bioactivity decreases. Crystallization of bioactive glasses decreases in vitro bioactivity. The density, micro hardness and flexural strength of bioactive glass - ceramics are higher than their respective bioactive <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> these are also increasing with the increase of ZnO content. </p...|$|R

5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E

5|$|Cerium was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> is an important part of catalytic converters.
