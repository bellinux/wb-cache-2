5|$|After the battle, the 21st took up camp in {{the former}} Confederate fort, {{remaining}} there for nearly a month. During that time, Lt. Col. Maggi, determined to make the 21st as disciplined as a regiment of Regulars, enforced stern standards for <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> dress parades. After the near mutiny of one company, Maggi submitted his resignation. Maj. William S. Clark, a professor of chemistry at Amherst College, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on February 28, 1862.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its origins}} as an {{engineering}} school, the West Point curriculum emphasised mathematics and other technical subjects of relevance to that speciality rather than education in military topics. Much {{of the military}} training that was conducted concerned close order <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> equitation. Of the top 25 graduates {{of the class of}} 1915, 24 were commissioned into the Corps of Engineers. The exception, James A. Lester, who was ranked 23rd in the class, chose to go into the field artillery instead. He would also become major general.|$|E
5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Eichelberger {{became the}} Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted {{a number of}} reforms, cutting back {{activities}} such as horseback riding and close order <b>drill,</b> <b>and</b> substituting modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while still at West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's {{formation}} training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E

Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. Camps were established in every state including at Enoggera (Queensland), Liverpool (New South Wales), Broadmeadows (Victoria), Brighton (Tasmania), Morphettville (South Australia) and Blackboy Hill (Western Australia). In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others—such as the 5th Battalion—spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still quite rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level.

40|$|The {{search for}} "zero defects" ice cores {{continues}} {{to challenge the}} ice coring <b>and</b> <b>drilling</b> community. No single <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> coring device will fill all needs. Each project will have special requirements and will require an initial decision as to the most effective drilling system {{to be used as}} well as ensuring personal and environmental safety. PICO has developed several types of <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> coring systems from a lightweight hand auger to more complicated electromechanical <b>drills</b> (dry <b>and</b> fluid-filled holes) with rock-penetrating capability <b>and</b> thermal <b>drills.</b> Logistics considerations are important, and a comparison is made between the drill types associated with system weight, expected power <b>and</b> <b>drilling</b> liquid requirements, <b>and</b> fuel consumption.

The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for the spectacle of the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.|$|E

He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. Washington learned to organize, train, <b>drill,</b> <b>and</b> discipline his companies and regiments. He learned the basics of battlefield tactics from his observations, readings, and conversations with professional officers, {{as well as a}} good understanding of problems of organization and logistics. He gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Washington in October 1861, the {{regiment}} spent the following winter in camp at Hall's Hill, near Arlington in Virginia. It {{became part of}} the Army of the Potomac, with which it would be associated for its entire term of service. The regiment saw its first action during the Siege of Yorktown in April 1862. It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign, particularly the Battle of Gaines' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the Battle of Gettysburg (60 percent). The 22nd Massachusetts was present for virtually all of the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg and Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign. The 22nd was especially proficient in skirmish <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> was frequently deployed in that capacity throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E

5|$|Kingsbury was {{originally}} {{assigned to the}} 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, but requested a transfer to the 2/14th Infantry Battalion to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted {{on the same day}} at a different recruitment centre. The pair undertook basic training at Puckapunyal, where they were assigned to the same section (7 Section of 9 Platoon) and were given drill instruction, rifle <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> mock battle training. After 7 Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.|$|E
5|$|Long {{before the}} Royal Military College of Canada was {{established}} in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer. The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following <b>drill</b> <b>and</b> meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E
