2500|$|Third, {{after the}} hammer strikes the string, the action must avoid an {{unwanted}} second blow, which could easily {{result from the}} hammer {{bouncing up and down}} within the space confining it. In Cristofori's action, this was accomplished by two means. By lifting the <b>intermediate</b> <b>lever</b> with a jack that disengages in its highest position, the Cristofori action made it possible for the hammer to fall (after its initial blow) to a position considerably lower than the highest position to which the key had lifted it. By itself, this mechanism greatly reduces the chance of an unwanted second blow. In addition, the Cristofori action also included a check (also called [...] "back check"; M) that catches the hammer and holds it in a partially raised position until the player releases the key; the check also helped to prevent unwanted second blows.|$|E
2500|$|First, a piano action must be {{arranged}} so that a key press does not actually lift the hammer {{all the way to}} the string. If it did, the hammer would block on the string and damp its vibrations. The position of the sprung 'hopper' or 'jack' centred in the key of Cristofori's action (see [...] "I" [...] in diagram below) is so adjusted that the hopper escapes from the 'notch' in the middle of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>lever</b> (G) just before the hammer (C) strikes the string, so that the hammer is not driven all the way but travels the remaining distance under its own momentum and then falls into the check (M). When the key is allowed to return to its position of rest, the jack springs back under the notch and a repeated blow is possible. Although Cristofori's design incorporates no specific device for repetition, the lightness of the action gives more facility for repetition than the heavier actions of the English type that developed in the first half of the 19th century, until these were provided with additions of one kind or another to facilitate repetition.|$|E
5000|$|The 1849 organ was {{described}} being capable of playing eleven musical (major) keys from the ordinary keyboard in pure intonation by furnishing multiple pipes for each physical key, with foot pedals operating <b>intermediate</b> <b>levers</b> {{inserted into the}} tracker works to switch between pairs of pallet valves furnished for each note. The inventors described great benefits due the tuning - they even claim it stayed in tune better - and argued how these balanced its greater size (up to 8 feet wider) and reduction in loudness compared with instruments of similar cost and number of pipes. They estimated one having [...] "two Diapasons, the Trumpet, the Oboe, the Dulciana, the Flute and the Clarabella, in perfect tune" [...] to cost between $4000 and $5000, and one third more if a Great Organ was desired.|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of pianos with a tangent action {{can be traced}} throughout the whole eighteenth century and even later. Sometimes these instruments are primitive harpsichord-to-piano conversions but in other cases they are refined pianos with a Stoßmechanik with non-pivoting vertical hammers. Apart from the first simple models of Jean Marius around 1716, Christoph Gottlieb Schröter before 1739 was probably the first to design a more sophisticated action with non-pivoting hammers propelled by <b>intermediate</b> <b>levers.</b> However, the most refined tangent pianos made during the eighteenth century are the instruments known as Tangentenflügel, build by Franz Jacob Spath and Christoph Friederich Schmahl from Regensburg and by their followers (such as Johann Wilhelm Berner). Tangent pianos were possibly exported from Germany to other countries. The pianos of this type made in England and Italy during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries might be traceable to the German tradition, but are probably not directly related to the school of Spath and Schmahl. In Italy, the pianos with a tangent action were made until the mid-nineteenth century. But in the rest of Europe, this type of action was made only until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The dissertation comprises detailed descriptions and a scientific catalogue of a wide number of pianos with a tangent action, including the Tangentenflügel of Spath and Schmahl, kept in public and private collections in Europe, the United States of America and Japan...|$|R

5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an <b>intermediate</b> <b>lever</b> between the lever that the key lifts and the striking hammer, Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable screw mounted underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|E

5000|$|In 1811 Wornum {{patented}} a small bichord upright standing {{about three}} feet three inches tall (99 cm) styled the [...] "unique". Its strings were stretched diagonally from the top {{to the right side}} of the case and communicated with a small sounding board, and the case itself was divided in half with separate parts containing the action and keyboard, and strings and frame. Wornum's escapement worked directly upon a padded notch on the hammer butt and in this way could omit the <b>intermediate</b> <b>lever</b> used in many square pianos and Southwell's cabinet uprights, and the hammer was returned to its resting position by a spring fixed to the hammer rail instead of by its own weight or that of the sticker. Like Southwell, Wornum used overdampers that pressed against the strings above the hammers and were mounted on levers hinged from a separate rail, but the wires that raised them were to be acted upon by the backward oriented base of the escapement instead of by the sticker or the hammer. Wornum also claimed a buff stop, operated by the left pedal which muted one of the strings of each note. Two articles published in 1851 indicate that the firm built several hundred of these pianos.|$|E
40|$|Recently Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) {{systems are}} being {{extensively}} used in internal combustion engine. In such mechanism, cams and valves are connected via <b>intermediate</b> <b>lever,</b> which allows different maximum valve lifts and duration using same cam profile. Recently, novel valve actuation mechanism like Continuous Variable Valve Lift (CVVL) is being explored to regulate engine output without conventional throttle valve and this reduces the pumping losses especially {{at part load}} in SI engines. CVVL mechanism with three elements consists of eccentric shaft, <b>Intermediate</b> <b>lever</b> and Rocker arm, which in turn control the degree of valve lift. It ensures a continuous valve lift between two extreme heights. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Numerical model of novel CVVL mechanism on FEA platform using ANSYS 14. 5, for small capacity single cylinder motorcycle engine. From the design point of view, on the strength basis all the critical components of CVVL mechanism with respective selected material were analyzed using developed numerical model in ANSYS 14. 5 and compared with analytical results. Numerical results {{were found to be}} in good agreement with analytical one for the given set of conditions...|$|E
