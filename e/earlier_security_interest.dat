50|$|A <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> {{is a type}} of {{property}} interest created by agreement or by operation of law over assets to secure the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt. It gives the beneficiary of the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> certain preferential rights in the disposition of secured assets. Such rights vary according to the type of <b>security</b> <b>interest,</b> but in most cases, a holder of the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> is entitled to seize, and usually sell, the property to discharge the debt that the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> secures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} some of {{the difficulties}} arising from how English law conceptualises certain types of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> over IPRs, and the problems arising from dual registration systems. This analysis is informed by a critical comparison of the current English doctrine, alongside the US system and the proposals from UNCITRAL. It is argued that attempts to regulate a world of integrated goods (whereby goods and software are inextricably interconnected), through unintegrated regimes of legal governance of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> over goods and IPRs, is unsustainable. It will thus be argued that reform of <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> law generally (to bring about a functional system of security) and a single register for <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> whether over goods or IPRs is necessary. Specific recommendations to deal with problems concerning purchase money <b>security</b> <b>interests,</b> and third-party purchasers, are put forward...|$|R

50|$|Absent perfection, {{the holder}} of the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> may have {{difficulty}} enforcing his rights in the collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in the same collateral.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the United States (U.S.) legal {{community}} {{arrived at a}} consensus that the traditional common law distinctions were obsolete and served no useful purpose. They tended to generate too much unnecessary litigation about whether the creditor had selected the correct type of <b>security</b> <b>interest.</b> There was a growing recognition that {{the different types of}} <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> had developed only because on the one hand, many judges thought there was something inherently wrong with allowing a person, either out of desperation or foolishness, to summarily encumber all his or her personal property as collateral for a loan, but on the other, debtors and creditors would attempt to reach a desired result by any means necessary, even if that meant resorting to creating multiple <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> to cover different types of personal property. There was also the problem of the above-mentioned early English cases that regarded such <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as fraudulent conveyances and failed to recognize that they had legitimate uses in a modern industrial economy. Therefore, because the very history of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> demonstrated that judicial resistance to enforcing broad <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> would not stop debtors from trying to give them as inducement to creditors to extend financing, and that they were socially useful under the proper circumstances, the better choice was to make the law of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as clear and simple as possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{discussion of the}} types of <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> principally concerns English law.

50|$|Fundamental {{concepts}} under Article 9 include how a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> {{is created}} (called attachment); {{how to give}} notice of a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> to the public, which makes the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> enforceable against others who may claim {{an interest in the}} collateral (called perfection); when multiple claims to the same collateral exist, determining which interests prevail over others (called priority); and what remedies a secured party has if the debtor defaults in payment or performance of the secured obligation.|$|R
40|$|Section 9 - 312 of the Uniform Commercial Code {{determines the}} {{priority}} of conflicting <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> 2 ̆ 7 in the same collateral. Generally, the first <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> filed is superior to all others. An exception is allowed for a purchase money <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> perfected within ten days of the debtor receiving the noninventory goods. In North Platte State Bank v. Production Credit Association, the Nebraska Supreme Court held the ten-day grace period begins when possession is received, rather than when the purchaser technically becomes a 2 ̆ 2 debtor 2 ̆ 2 of the purchase money creditor. This decision, though in direct conflict with other authority, is proper because it assures the certainty of <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> in noninventory collateral.

5000|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as {{adopted by}} all fifty states, {{generally}} governs secured transactions where <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> are taken in personal property.

UCC Article 9 replaced a wildly diverse array of security devices that had evolved in the various states during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{in response to the}} reluctance of U.S. courts to enforce general nonpossessory <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as either against public policy or because they were perceived as fraudulent conveyances. [...] The drafters of UCC Article 9, particularly Grant Gilmore, successfully argued that since historical experience showed that disfavoring such <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> would not prevent creditors from requesting them or debtors from trying to give them by any means necessary, and because they were clearly economically useful, the better path was to develop a unified, simplified law of <b>security</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|R
