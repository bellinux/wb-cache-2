50|$|The active {{ingredient}} that produces antimicrobial activity {{has been identified}} as hydnocarpic acid, a lipophilic compound. It acts by being an antagonist of biotin. The oil was used intravenously or intramuscularly {{in the early part of}} the twentiety century against leprosy. An ethyl ester of the oil was developed by Alice Ball in 1916 which led to the preparation and marketing of it by Burroughs Wellcome in the early 1920s. This was also used intravenously for leprosy patients often producing local reactions. The oil was also often obtained directly from India by several doctors in Africa, such as the East African Rift. The doctors would locally prepare ethyl esters to treat their patients. In June 1927, Burroughs Wellcome released the commercial preparation, sodium hydnocarpate marketed as Alepol, which produced lesser disagreeable symptoms of pain, swelling, <b>irritating</b> <b>cough</b> and blocking of the veins. In May 1928, doctors reported cure of leprosy in some patients after treatment with alepol.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Patients {{that have}} {{undergone}} a laryngectomy lose the normal heat-moisture-exchange {{functions of the}} nose and upper airways. Breathing unconditioned air can cause irritation of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa and lead to chest complaints such as <b>irritating</b> <b>coughing</b> and excessive mucus production and mucus plugs. Disposable HME's that cover the tracheostoma and are stuck to the skin with adhesives are believed to improve the condition of inspired air for laryngectomy patients. HME's work by accumulating heat and moisture during exhalation and reciprocally warming and humidifying in spired air. Due {{to the cost of}} HMEs they are not affordable to the general population in South Africa and many other countries. Stoma Covers are simple devices made of a single fabric or combinations of fabrics that are fastened around the neck with the cloth covering the tracheostoma. They are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and can be washed and re-used. No research has been conducted to date regarding the effect of using simple Stoma Covers to improve the tracheal climate in laryngectomy patients...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{refractory}} cough (CRC) {{is defined}} as a cough that persists despite guideline based treatment. It is seen in 20 - 46 % of patients presenting to specialist cough clinics and it has a substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization. Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including the recently introduced term cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Key symptoms include a dry <b>irritated</b> <b>cough</b> localized around the laryngeal region. Symptoms are not restricted to cough and can include globus, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Chronic refractory cough has factors in common with laryngeal hypersensitivity syndromes and chronic pain syndromes, and these similarities help to shed light on the pathophysiology of the condition. Its pathophysiology is complex and includes cough reflex sensitivity, central sensitization, peripheral sensitization, and paradoxical vocal fold movement. Chronic refractory cough often occurs after a viral infection. The diagnosis is made once the main diseases that cause chronic cough have been excluded (or treated) and cough remains refractory to medical treatment. Several treatments have been developed over the past decade. These include speech pathology interventions using techniques adapted from the treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders, as well as the use of centrally acting neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Potential new treatments in development also show promise...|$|R

40|$|Cough is {{the most}} {{frequent}} nonspecific manifestation of airway disease in the general practitioner’s office. It {{has a number of}} forms and a very wide range of causes. Chronic persistent <b>cough</b> is <b>irritating</b> nonproductive <b>cough,</b> persisting usually for more than three weeks, with a negative chest x-ray finding, with normal spirometry results, and without an ob-vious or documented cause(1). Physiologically, it is a purposeful protective mechanism designed to maintain airway patency. Based on active forced expiratory volume, it removes from the airways not only any foreign bodies but, also, mucus and products of pathological processes in the airways and in the lungs. Chronic cough deteriorates the child’s quality of life, res-tricts his/her activities, results in diminishing his/her overall fitness, and in sleep disorders.

40|$|At present, {{approximately}} 20 % of Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) are relapsed and refractory, {{and therapeutic}} methods including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and even stem cell transplantation are unsatisfactory. Brentuximab vedotin, composed of CD 30 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent, {{is a new}} targeted drug that eradicates tumor cells by binding to the CD 30 antigen on their surface. In clinical trials, the response rate and complete remission rate of this drug were 73 % and 40 %, respectively, for relapsed and refractory HL. Here we report a case of CD 30 -positive relapsed and refractory HL that was treated with brentuximab. Before the treatment with brentuximab, the patient underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation. However, the disease continued to progress, affecting multiple organs and prompting symptoms such as persistent fever. After the treatment with brentuximab, the patient's condition improved. Body temperature returned to normal after 4 days. Lung nodules were reduced in size and number after a single course of treatment, and PET/CT showed partial remission and complete remission after 3 and 6 courses of treatment, respectively. The entire treatment process progressed smoothly, though the patient experienced some symptoms due to chemotherapy, including peripheral neuritis of the limbs, <b>irritating</b> dry <b>cough,</b> and mild increase in aminotransferase.

Chest radiography showed an anterior mediastinal mass. Computed tomography (CT) examination of the chest revealed a homogeneous tissular mass occupying the anterior mediastinum in its upper and medium stage, extending to the infundibulum without lymph node enlargement. Thymectomy and wedge were performed via a median sternotomy. Pathologic diagnosis was nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease of the thymus. The patient received 6 cycles of ABVD (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], bleomycin, vinblastin and dacarbazine) and mediastinal radiotherapy.

40|$|AIM: To {{outline the}} {{appropriate}} diagnostic methods and therapeutic options for acquired bronchobiliary fistula (BBF). METHODS: Literature searches were performed in Medline, EMBASE, PHMC and LWW (January 1980 -August 2010) {{using the following}} keywords: biliobronchial fistula, bronchobiliary fistula, broncho-biliary fistula, biliary-bronchial fistula, tracheobiliary fistula, hepatobronchial fistula, bronchopleural fistula, and biliptysis. Further articles were identified through cross-referencing. RESULTS: Sixty-eight cases were collected and reviewed. BBF secondary to tumors (32. 3 %, 22 / 68), including primary tumors (19. 1 %, 13 / 68) and hepatic metastases (13. 2 %, 9 / 68), shared the largest proportion of all cases. Biliptysis was found in all patients, and other symptoms were respiratory symptoms, such as <b>irritating</b> <b>cough,</b> fever (36 / 68) and jaundice (20 / 68). Half of the patients were treated by less-invasive methods such as endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. Invasive approaches like surgery were used less frequently (41. 7 %, 28 / 67).

We hypothesised that changes in nerves modulating mechanical sensitivity in areas of interstitial fibrosis might lead to enhanced cough response to mechanical stimulation of the chest in IPF. Methods: We studied 27 non-smoking subjects with IPF (63 % male), mean (SD) age 71. 7 (7) years and 30 healthy non-smokers. Quality of life (Leicester Cough Questionnaire), cough symptom scores and cough severity scores (visual analog scales) were recorded.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the characteristics of subjects from the general population that report SBS-related symptoms. METHODS: The study comprised a randomly selected population of 418 individuals aged 20 - 45 years. The subjects underwent a structured interview, skin prick tests, a methacholine provocation test and answered two questionnaires respectively assessing psychiatric status and the presence of SBS symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-seven subjects (21 %) reported one or more SBS symptom weekly. Most common were general symptoms reported by 10 % of the population. Female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 1), atopy (OR = 2. 2) and anxiety (OR = 2. 6) were significant independent risk factors for reporting at least one SBS-related symptom. Anxiety (OR = 3. 2) and depression (OR = 4. 4) were significant predictors for general symptoms, while bronchial hyper-responsiveness was a significant predictor for pharyngeal symptoms (dryness in the throat, sore throat and <b>irritating</b> <b>cough)</b> (OR = 5. 4).

40|$|Whooping cough is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} disease that is usually caused by Bordetella pertussis. A similar illness is caused by B. parapertussis, {{but this is not}} preventable with presently available vaccines. There is an initial catarrhal stage, followed by an <b>irritating</b> <b>cough</b> that gradually becomes paroxysmal, usually within one to two weeks. The paroxysms are often followed by a characteristic ‘whoop’, often accompanied by vomiting. In young infants, the typical ‘whoop ’ may never develop and coughing spasms may be followed by periods of apnoea. The illness often lasts for two to three months. In older children and adults, the disease may be mild and not recognised as whooping cough. Pertussis may be complicated by bronchopneumonia, repeated vomiting leading to weight loss, and cerebral hypoxia with a resulting risk of brain damage. Severe complications and deaths occur most commonly in infants under six months of age. Minor complications include subconjunctival haemorrhages, epistaxis (nosebleeds), facial oedema, ulceration of the tongue or surrounding area, and suppurative otitis media. Transmission of the infection is by droplet, and cases are most infectious during the early catarrhal phase. The incubation period is between six and 20 days and cases are infectious from six days after exposure to three weeks after the onset of typical paroxysms. History and epidemiology of the disease Before the introduction of pertussis immunisation in the 1950 s, the average annual number of notifications exceeded 120, 000 in the UK. By 1972, when vaccine coverage was around 80 %, there were only 2069 notifications of pertussis. Because of professional and public anxiety about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, coverage fell to about 30 % in 1975 and major epidemics occurred in 1977 – 79 and 1981 – 83. In 1978, there were over 68, 000 notifications and 14 deaths. The actual number of deaths due t...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recurrent {{malignant}} pleural eff usion (MPE) is {{a common}} complication of breast carcinoma causing an <b>irritating</b> <b>cough</b> and pain due to the fl uid exerting pressure on the lungs. As the systemic therapy fails in {{approximately half of the}} patients with pleural eff usion, one of the palliative methods is used. Lately, the most commonly used procedure is the chemical pleurodesis with talc or the thoracoscopic mechanical pleurodesis. Th e aim {{of the study was to}} prove certain advantages of the latter method, especially at lower MPE pH values, since the chemical pleurodesis in those cases does not provide acceptable results. Methods: Th is prospective, randomized study included 87 patients with breast carcinoma and morphologically proven malignant pleural eff usion. Patients were divided into two groups according to palliative treatment: the TMP group (thoracoscopic mechanical pleurodesis) and the TP group (talc pleurodesis). Th ere were also four subcategories according to the pH value of malignant pleural eff usion (≥ 7. 3, < 7. 3). Results: Th e eff ectiveness (no recurrence of pleural eff usion) of TP (91 %) and TMP (92 %) was identical in patients with a MPE pH value above 7. 3. However, in patients with pH value under 7. 3 TMP was more successful (81 %) than TP (55 %). Th e lowest pH values at which the methods proved successful were 7. 06 in TMP and 7. 25 in TP. Conclusion: TP proved to be a more useful palliative method in patients with pH values above 7. 3 due to its simplicity. On the other hand, TMP is more successful at lower pH values. Furthermore, TMP is also very eff ective in the group of patients with higher pH values, especially for handling cytologically or histologically unconfi rmed malignant pleural eff usions and in suspected adhesions in the pleural space...|$|E

However, despite the frequency of measles in children, paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) has only previously been described as a complication on one occasion (Dacie, 1954). The purpose of this report is to describe a second case ofPCH complicat-ing measles and to make some observations on the Donath-Landsteiner red cell auto-antibody involved. Case Report Our patient was a 4 -year-old girl. Her parents were unrelated and well and she had two healthy sibs. There was no family history of haematological or venereal disease. Immunization (oral polio vaccine, triple antigen, and smallpox vaccination) had been carried out with no ill effects and she had previously suffered attacks of mumps and varicella without complications. Seven days before the patient's admission on January 31, 1965, her sister developed a typical measles rash and she herself developed a sore throat, cough, and fever. These symptoms continued despite treatment with aspirin, penicillin, and tetracycline. On the day before admission, when her temperature was 410 C. (1060 F.), she vomited, had a rigor, and complained of backache. She passed a specimen of dark brown urine. There was no history of exposure to excessive cold before this incident, but it was midwinter.
