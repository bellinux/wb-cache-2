5|$|Monument 14 is an eroded Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{dating to}} the Middle Preclassic. It represents a squatting <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> possibly female, wearing a headdress and earspools. Under one arm it grips a jaguar cub, under the other it carries a fawn.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man stands {{close to}} Rackwick Bay {{on the west}} coast of the island of Hoy, in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, and {{can be seen from the}} Scrabster to Stromness ferry. From certain angles it is said to {{resemble}} a <b>human</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions of the <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive {{of the female}} body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|The Altar {{measures}} 25 by 50 cm {{and bears}} designs that include circles, hills, <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> and a deer. The combination of six <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> with the deer {{has been interpreted}} as a Maya calendrical date by Guatemalan anthropologist Lina Barrios.|$|R
50|$|The {{groupings of}} Anthropomorphic forms, or stylized <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> {{together}} with a quadrangular object and a stick or pole bearing an inscription, appear most frequently. Most of the time this particular group of abstract <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> is found alongside objects.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} later Jewish {{illuminated}} manuscripts from the Middle Ages, {{and some other}} works with <b>human</b> <b>figures.</b> The [...] "Birds Head Haggadah" [...] (German, now in Jerusalem) gives all the <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> the heads of birds, presumably {{in an attempt to}} mitigate any breach of the prohibition.|$|R
5|$|The kings also issued {{many types}} of coins for circulation. Several types of coins {{categorized}} as Sethu Bull coins issued from 1284 to 1410 are found in large quantities {{in the northern part}} of Sri Lanka. The obverse of these coins have a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi (bull) symbol, the legend Setu in Tamil with a crescent moon above.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each <b>human</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E

5|$|Māori cloaks {{are made}} of fine flax fibre and {{patterned}} with black, red and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes. Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received {{a reputation for being}} casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic mascot, {{an animal}} or <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> {{representing}} the cultural {{heritage of the}} host country, was introduced in 1968. It has played {{an important part of}} the Games' identity promotion since the 1980 Summer Olympics, when the Russian bear cub Misha reached international stardom. The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} traits {{of the character}} Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), {{and some of her}} traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, Evangelions mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> and the abstract designs of the Angels, also {{had a significant impact on}} the designs of future anime productions.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} reason behind the sexless <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> {{depicted}} in rock carvings from the Bronze Age in Scandinavia, {{to understand why}} they are sexless while others have indicated sex markers, and to investigate which theories about them are the most reliable - are they sexless by purpose, or are they women, men, children or are they a third gender? This interdisciplinary study with archeology and gender research will discuss and analyze <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> with non distinct sex markers from 10 pictures of rock carvings from Scandinavia with the purpose to understand the lack of sex markers such as phallus and long hair. The ambition of this essay is that a study of this kind will deepen the general knowledge of the subject of rock art and possibly contribute to the discussion about the Bronze Age society's view of gender. The result and discussion of this study have shown that several earlier theories about the sexless <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> could be confirmed, for example that small mostly sexless <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> are children but {{that they are not}} a specific indicator of sex and that shamans are depicted in ceremonies, but that not all sexless <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> should be interpreted as shamans. The discussion also contradicted a few of the earlier theories, for example the theory that weapons always indicate male sex and that the lack of it indicates female sex, and that all <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> on ships should be interpreted as male even if they do not have any sex markers. The sexless <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> are still a mystery, but this study have lead to the conclusion that they are sexless by purpose and that sex markers such as phallus and long hair are indicators of masculinity and femininity, not the biological male and female sex...|$|R
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero {{that he thought he}} would be.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E

5|$|The make-up for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO make-up department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> they are called inunnguaq.|$|E
5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

5|$|In the Pasión River {{region of}} Petén, rulers {{began to be}} portrayed as ballplayers on stelae. Seibal was the first site {{in the region to}} depict its rulers thus. Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889, and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, {{including}} a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth. Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a non-Maya site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Stelae at Oxkintok, to the north in the Puuc region of the Yucatán Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female. The representation of the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.|$|E
