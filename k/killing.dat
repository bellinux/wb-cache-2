The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted <b>killing</b> is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted <b>killing</b> as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of <b>killing</b> and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of <b>killing</b> by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of <b>killing</b> is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of <b>killing</b> in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

5000|$|As {{in other}} countries, {{the exact number}} of honour <b>killings</b> is not known. Latest {{official}} data puts the number of women killed in honour <b>killings</b> in 2015 at nearly 1,100, suggesting these types of <b>killings</b> are on the rise (or perhaps are being better reported). Sources disagree as to the exact number by year. In 2011, human rights groups reported 720 honour <b>killings</b> in Pakistan (605 women and 115 men), while Pakistan's Human Rights Commission reported that in 2010 there were 791 honour <b>killings</b> in the country, and Amnesty International cited 960 incidents of women alone who were slain in honour <b>killings</b> that year.|$|R

Later that same evening, he participated in the Gauntlet for the Gold match, but was eliminated by Malice. The following week, <b>Killings</b> lost to Christopher after Marlin and Sadler interfered in their match.

5|$|Gray wolves {{typically}} dominate other canid {{species in}} areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of gray wolves <b>killing</b> coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and <b>killing</b> their pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes <b>killing</b> wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them. Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities. Gray wolves {{are the most important}} predator of raccoon dogs, <b>killing</b> large numbers of them {{in the spring and summer}} periods. Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them. In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent report}} noted {{that one in}} five homicides in Pakistan are {{attributed}} to honour <b>killings.</b> The prevalence of such honour <b>killings</b> that have been reported are around 2,000 <b>killings</b> every four years. Overall, out of all homicides of {{both men and women}} in Pakistan, honour <b>killings</b> of women constitute 21%. Moreover, the perpetrator in most honour <b>killings</b> is the husband. One study found as high as 92% of all honour <b>killings</b> are committed by the spouse. The highest occurring reason in spousal honour <b>killings</b> was alleged extramarital affairs. Much of the data has been collected by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan through newspaper reports, however, it is clear there needs to be more systematic research by a health agency is needed to assess this public health crisis and effectively plan for solutions as many cases go unreported. Another analysis of this research states that a possible explanation of the high rate of honour <b>killings</b> towards married women could be attributed to the generally high statistics of domestic violence in Pakistan.|$|R

Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be its master. Voldemort attempts one final <b>Killing</b> Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, <b>killing</b> Voldemort at last.|$|E

Honor <b>killings</b> have also taken place in immigrant communities in Europe, Canada and the U.S. In some parts of the world, honor <b>killings</b> enjoy considerable public support: in one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan's capital city, Amman, approved of honor <b>killings.</b> A survey in Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.|$|R

Spousal revenge <b>killings</b> are <b>killings</b> of children done to indirectly harm a domestic partner; they do not frequently occur.

5000|$|Data and {{its absence}} are {{difficult}} to interpret. One reason is the reluctance to report honour <b>killings</b> to official bodies. Another reason is that honour <b>killings</b> are occurring in cultural and social contexts which do not recognize the criminality of honour <b>killings.</b> The very nature of honour <b>killings</b> reflects deeply entrenched notions of [...] "honour" [...] and [...] "morality", in which the perpetrator is upholding justice and order when the victim commits deplorable social acts. Honour <b>killings</b> thus inverts the roles of [...] "right" [...] and [...] "wrong". The perpetrator becomes the champion of justice while the victim becomes the perpetrator and accused of the criminal act. Furthermore, human rights advocates are in wide agreement that the reported cases {{do not reflect the}} full extent of the issue, as honour <b>killings</b> have a high level of support in Pakistan's rural society, and thus often go unreported. Frequently, women killed in honour <b>killings</b> are recorded as having committed suicide or died in accidents.|$|R
