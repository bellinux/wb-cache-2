5|$|Heavy rains in {{association}} with thunderstorms on February 4 to February 6, combined with the melting of snow, caused flooding across parts of Illinois, New York, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. Among the areas <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the flooding rivers and streams were the Miami Valley, areas along the Blanchard River in Findlay and parts of northern Indiana between Indianapolis and north of Fort Wayne along the Tippecanoe, St. Marys and Wabash Rivers. Several streets in Fort Wayne were under water, and flooding also occurred between Lafayette and Terre Haute.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} Cook Islands were <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Percy as {{the storm}} left 640people homeless, of which 600 were in Pukapuka, and 40 were in Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing. One person was rescued when his fishing boat stalled during the storm. Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable. Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal.|$|E
5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} in the time affected several cities and parishes in Jamaica and Cuba, along with causing significant rainfall in southern Florida. Jamaica was the area <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the depression, claiming the lives of six people and causing about $1.802 million (1987 USD, $3 million in 2009 USD) in damage. The depression caused floods that washed out villages, roads and bridges and caused dozens of landslides on the island. The island also had several rivers overflow including the Rio Minho and Rio Dogna. The damage caused by the tropical depression was comparable to previous flood in June 1986.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix has {{maintained}} a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, {{as well as being}} the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows {{and against the}} US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national {{economic crisis in}} the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis. This increased popular discontent with the New Order {{and led to}} popular protest across the country. Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998. In 1999, East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia, after a twenty-five-year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the East Timorese.|$|E
25|$|This crisis-driven {{drop into}} a lower income group {{happened}} in other occupations as well. In absolute numbers, the <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> post-famine impoverishment were women and landless agricultural labourers.

In absolute numbers, agricultural labourers faced {{the highest rates}} of both destitution and mortality.|$|E

25|$|Relief was the {{immediate}} {{effort to help}} the one-third {{of the population that}} was <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the depression. Roosevelt expanded Hoover's FERA work relief program, and added the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Public Works Administration (PWA), and starting in 1935 the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In 1935 the Social Security Act (SSA) and unemployment insurance programs were added. Separate programs were set up for relief in rural America, such as the Resettlement Administration and Farm Security Administration.|$|E
25|$|The League of Nations labeled Chile {{the country}} <b>hardest</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the Great Depression because 80% of {{government}} revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, {{which were in}} low demand.
