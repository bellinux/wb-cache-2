25|$|The major {{breeding}} objectives include high grain yield, good quality, {{disease and}} insect resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral, moisture and heat tolerance. The major diseases in temperate environments include the following, {{arranged in a}} rough order of their significance from cooler to warmer climates: eyespot, Stagonospora nodorum blotch (also known as <b>glume</b> blotch), yellow or stripe rust, powdery mildew, Septoria tritici blotch (sometimes known as leaf blotch), brown or leaf rust, Fusarium head blight, tan spot and stem rust. In tropical areas, spot blotch (also known as Helminthosporium leaf blight) is also important.|$|E
25|$|Teosintes {{strongly}} resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are {{distinguished from}} maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing bunches of distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature {{to form a}} two-ranked 'ear' of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a cupule or depression in the rachis and a tough lower <b>glume.</b> This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on teosinte and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. Teosinte seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E

3000|$|The ancestral {{spikelet}} {{structure for}} Ehrhartoideae is a three-flowered spikelet {{in which the}} lower two flowers are sterile; this spikelet structure is uniquely derived (synapomorphic) for the subfamily (Grass Phylogeny Working Group 2001). Members of tribe Ehrharteae exhibit this structure clearly, with two <b>glumes,</b> two proximal sterile lemmas (remnants of the lower two flowers), and a single hermaphrodite floret. The internodes between these structures (rachilla) may {{be more or less}} elongated. Many members of the tribe Oryzeae, including O. sativa itself, retain this same ancestral structure, except that the <b>glumes</b> are minute ("rudimentary glumes" [...] (Bommert et al. 2005)) (Fig.  3). In other members of Oryzeae, the <b>glumes</b> are reduced to a cup-like rim. In addition, the sterile lemmas may be small or missing. In some species in which <b>glumes</b> and/or sterile lemmas are missing, the elongated internode then appears simply as a long stalk, sometimes called a stipe, above the <b>glumes</b> or above the sterile lemmas (Watson and Dallwitz 1992).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the width and length incidence in a single seed fraction of oat [Avena sativa (L.) ] cv. Cristal. The seeds were selected by a mechanical divider and by hand, and their correspondence to radiographic images in seeds with <b>glumes</b> and their caryopses. The width and length of the seeds with <b>glumes</b> and their caryopses were measured with electronic calliper, and their weight, with precision balance. Radiographic images of seeds with <b>glumes</b> were taken with an X-ray experimental equipment. The analyst selected seeds with <b>glumes</b> by the width and by the length previously determined and so with more weight, than that obtained by hand selection was slightly narrower, larger and lighter. The presence of the <b>glumes</b> masked the caryopses real dimensions (width and length), and conduced the analyst to select seeds that differed more by the width than by the length. The radiographic images showed the presence, or not, of caryopses inside the seed and its real dimensions. The mechanical partition method for seeds showed to be more efficient because the analyst subjectivity was not considered when the selection upon its dimensions was done. The X-ray analysis was a useful tool that complements the pure seed fraction selection as another factor of seed quality. 200...|$|R

40|$|Rice grain {{discolouration}} has {{a complex}} etiology and cannot be diagnosed prior to harvest. In Italy, {{the disease was}} thought to be associated with fungal infections, how-ever several studies contradicted this hypothesis. We re-port the distribution of grain discolouration, the most sus-ceptible Italian rice varieties, and the effects of epidemics of brown spot, induced by Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and abiotic factors, such as incidence of grains with open <b>glumes,</b> chemical treatments, nitrogen fertilization, and time of sowing, on disease incidence over three years. Among 39 heavily diseased rice lots, the early cvs Selenio and Loto were the most susceptible. We did not find any significant correlation between incidence of grain dis-colouration and incidence of brown spot. In contrast, in-cidence of discoloured grains was weakly correlated with incidence of grains with open <b>glumes</b> (r = 0. 521 P = 0. 001), while incidence of brown spot was better correlat-ed with incidence of grains with sealed <b>glumes</b> (r = 0. 570, P < 0. 001) than to incidence of grains with open <b>glumes</b> (r = 0. 355, P = 0. 026).

The highest percent of grains with open <b>glumes</b> was found for late-sown rice.
