It was quite obvious that {{they had decided to}} fight the battle out for England and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging.

500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

2500|$|Pipes was a firm {{supporter}} of the Vietnam War, and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration. Pipes had previously considered {{himself to be a}} Democrat, but after anti-war George McGovern gained the 1972 Democratic nomination for President, he switched to the Republican Party. Pipes used to accept being described as a [...] "neoconservative", once saying that [...] "others see me that way, and, you know, maybe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> of them." [...] However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the neoconservative positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a [...] "plain conservative".|$|E

At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one)</b> are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos.

2500|$|On 12 April 2006, Afridi {{announced}} a temporary retirement from Test cricket {{so that he}} could concentrate on ODIs, with a particular focus on the 2007 World Cup, and {{to spend more time with}} his family. He said he would consider reversing his decision after the World Cup. Afridi had played ten Tests since being recalled to the side in January 2005, averaging 47.44 with the bat including four centuries. However, on 27 April he reversed his decision, saying that [...] " [...] told me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> of the main players in the team and squad and that Pakistan really needed me". Before Pakistan toured England in July to September, Afridi played for Ireland as an overseas player in the C Trophy. In six matches, he scored 128runs and took seven wickets. England won the four-match Test series 3–0; Afridi played two matches, scoring 49runs and took three wickets. It was the last Test cricket Afridi played until 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Prayer {{seems to}} me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, {{the rules of the game}} as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the {{challenge}} of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out [...] "how long?" [...] to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It {{seems to me}} that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn, is glory enough for me. I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was, when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun, and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire, and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff of my being is matter, ever changing, ever moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger-rings. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> with the infinite and need no other assurance.|$|E
