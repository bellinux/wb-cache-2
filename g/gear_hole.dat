40|$|The {{purpose of}} modern surface {{hardening}} technology is obtaining reproducible, precisely planned {{parameters of the}} carburized layer, minimizing the negative phenomena that result in dimensional changes after hardening and {{making it possible to}} determine the nature and magnitude of these changes. This concerns mainly the concept of single-piece flow in heat treatment applied for the purposes of mass production, employing a special autonomous 4 D Quenching chamber for high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ). The main components of the 4 D Quenching chamber include a system of cooling nozzles surrounding the processed item and providing a uniform inflow of cooling gas from all directions (3 D) and a table rotating together with the item processed, contributing to uniform cooling (4 D). Within the framework of this paper there was studied the impact of gear wheel quenching in a 4 D Quenching chamber using nitrogen at pressure of 6 and 10 bar on changes in geometry. Geometric measurements of facewidth of <b>gear,</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and outside diameter were performed before and after carburization and quenching. The results obtained allowed us to determine the impact of quenching pressure inside a 4 D Quenching chamber on dimensional changes in gear wheels analyzed. The thermo-chemical treatment resulted in a decrease in outside diameters and hole diameters measured and an increase in facewidth of gears...|$|E
50|$|An {{odometer}} {{for measuring}} distance was first described by Vitruvius around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor {{may have been}} Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC - c. 212 BC). It was based on chariot wheels turning 400 times in one Roman mile. For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel, thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another <b>gear</b> with <b>holes</b> along the circumference, where pebbles (calculus) were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by {{counting the number of}} pebbles.|$|R
50|$|Noted {{for being}} {{promoted}} through TV commercials {{in which a}} box of the cereal would suddenly appear and interrupt some other activity, Clackers was a breakfast cereal whose flavor {{was intended to be}} similar to that of graham crackers. Each individual piece of the cereal was almost large enough to fit onto a teaspoon, and the shape of a typical piece resembled a small <b>gear</b> with a <b>hole</b> in the center.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the skiable terrain in-bounds, there is an even larger area to be explored off-piste (out of bounds). These areas are accessed through marked gates by expert skiers/boarders who are equipped with avalanche safety <b>gear.</b> Jackson <b>Hole's</b> original aerial tram was {{closed to the public}} in the fall of 2006 and replaced with a new tram that opened in 2008. The tram's vertical rise is 4139 ft to an elevation of 10450 ft above sea level. Construction on the new, 100-passenger Doppelmayr CTEC tram began in June 2007 and it began service on December 20, 2008. During the two seasons without a tram, a temporary double chairlift named East Ridge was built to service the runs at the top of Rendezvous Mountain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{odometer}} of Vitruvius {{was based}} on chariot wheels of 4 feet (1.2 m) diameter turning 400 times in one Roman mile (about 1400 m). For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another <b>gear</b> with <b>holes</b> along the circumference, where pebbles (calculus) were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by {{counting the number of}} pebbles. [...] Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. Leonardo da Vinci later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed. However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the Antikythera mechanism. With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring <b>gears,</b> have equidistant <b>holes</b> {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{geothermal}} reservoir development, tracer tests {{can be one of}} the most useful methods for evaluating hydrogeo logical characteristics of the reservoir. Laboratory experimental apparatus of tracer test with vertical two -dimensional porous media of 150 cm length, 60 cm height and 2 cm thickness filled with glass beads of 1 mm diameter was manufactured Wells were simulated by injecting and extracting fluid with <b>gear</b> pumps from <b>holes.</b> Twenty holes were made on the outer plastic wall such that the hole can represent wells pen etrating perpendicularly the porous media. In the experiments, 1. 2 wt% NaCl solution was used as a tracer. Tracer concentration was measured using conductivity sensor at the production well. We conducted four experiments by changing its positions of the wells. Both flowrates of injection and production were kept constant to be 100 ml/min. When the distance between the reinjection and production wells was increased, the peak values of the tracer concentration became lower and its arriving time grew later...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the service life of gears and bearings inside the ranging arm, and increase {{the reliability of the}} shearer, the hydraulic system of the gear pump was installed for forced lubrication and cooling. The ranging arm gearbox was used as an oil tank for the automatic lubrication device. At the other side of shearer ranging arm I, screw pump 1 was mounted. In the gear oil tank, N 320 middle load gear oil was injected. The gear on axial group I drives the gears on the gear pump, and the lubricating oil in the pump, under the action of centrifugal force, was pumped out through the oil tube to filter, which filters out impurities in the oil. After the cooling, the oil was transported by pipeline to the axial group III, axial group IV, axial group V, axial group VI and axial group VII. Each axial group and <b>gear</b> had special <b>holes</b> drilled, and the lubricating oil lubricated the mating surfaces through the <b>hole</b> as the <b>gear</b> turned.|$|R
