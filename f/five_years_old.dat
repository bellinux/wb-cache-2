5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four.

40|$|Beginning in the mid- 1960 s, {{many state}} governments, {{particularly}} in the South and West, began to subsidize kindergartens for the first time. These initiatives generated wide variation across states over time in the supply of seats for <b>five</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> in public schools. This paper uses the staggered timing and age-targeting of these preschool expansions to examine how the provision of universal child care through public schools affects maternal labor supply. I find that single women with <b>five</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds</b> but no younger children {{were more likely to}} be employed once kindergartens were available. The estimated effect is large, implying that three mothers entered the labor force for every ten children enrolled in public school. By contrast, I detect no significant labor supply response among other single women with eligible children or among married mothers of <b>five</b> <b>year</b> <b>olds.</b> These findings complement other research suggesting that preschools targeted toward at-risk populations, such as children in single-parent families, are more cost effective than universal programs. ...|$|R
