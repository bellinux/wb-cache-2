The Secure Electronic <b>Enrollment</b> <b>Kit</b> (SEEK) and a 3 D Wireless Facial Recognition Binoculars prototype were studied to determine if an at-a-distance capability existed and if such a capability would be useful to the tactical user. The SEEK was studied because of its current employment as a biometric collection system. The 3 D binoculars were studied because they claim true at-a-distance capabilities. Experimentation with the SEEK provided no evidence supporting an at-a-distance capability, however, modifications to system configurations enabled the SEEK to transmit data captured on-site, to databases for identification over a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). This finding allowed users to collect and identify individuals on-site; eliminating the need to return to a hardwired location to upload data. The 3 D facial recognition binocular system reviewed in this thesis is designed to enable users to conduct facial recognition at-a-distance to provide a covert, biometric collection method, at-a-distance, without the need for a cooperative subject. This technology could provide the at-a-distance capability needed by a tactical user. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|E

Current methods for sharing biometric data in MIO are unnecessarily slow and do not leverage wireless networks at the tactical edge to maximize information dominance. Field experiments allow students to test wireless MANETs at the tactical edge. Analysis is focused on determining optimal MANET design and implementation. It considers various implementations with varied antenna selection, radio power, and frequency specifications, and two specific methods of integrating Department of Defense biometric collection devices to the wireless MANET, which utilizes a single (WR) MPU 4 802. 11 Wi-Fi access point to connect secure electronic <b>enrollment</b> <b>kit</b> II (SEEK II) biometric devices to the MANET, and tethers each SEEK device to a dedicated WR using a personal Ethernet connection. Biometric data is shared across the tactical network and transmitted to remote servers. Observations and analysis regarding network performance demonstrate that wireless MANETs can be optimized for biometric reach back and integrated with biometric devices to improve biometric data sharing in MIO.

It might {{take the form}} of a publicly funded service delivery platform with certain services being sub-contracted depending on the readiness and advantages of private providers. Other sensitive services such as the maintenance of a unified ID together with a centralized database on beneficiaries and contributors would naturally be kept by the public authorities. An example of a service that might be outsourced is the enrollment of beneficiaries using <b>enrollment</b> <b>kits</b> that rely on biometric IDs. Here sub-contractors could be equipped with portable <b>enrollment</b> <b>kits</b> that provide easy to use biometric identification services to a vast network of sub-contractors. 16 Clearly, this kind of arrangement also needs to set appropriate incentives to maximize enrollment and define benchmarks to assess the performance of the sub-contractors. Moreover, it needs to ensure trust and minimize error, fraud, and corruption.|$|R
