That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, {{but they have been}} used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> not {{suited for}} {{or unwilling to}} undergo surgery, several drugs {{have been found to}} inhibit {{cortisol}} synthesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone) but they are of limited efficacy. Mifepristone is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostatis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing's syndrome. However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an abortifacient. In February 2012, the FDA approved mifepristone to control high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that mifepristone should never be used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
40|$|Selectivity of {{proteinuria}} in congenital {{nephrotic syndrome}} of the Finnish type. The selectivity of proteinuria was determined in 14 patients with congenital (CNF) and 21 patients with acquired nephrotic syndrome by estimating, with quantitative immunological methods, the relative clearance of orosomucoid, transferrin, IgG and α- 2 -macroglobulin. Selectivity was generally as high {{in patients with}} CNF, as it was <b>in</b> <b>those</b> with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome with minimal changes in renal histology. In contrast, selectivity was generally low in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with glomerulonephritic history. However, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> CNF <b>patients</b> who had particularly severe glomerular lesions, selectivity was low over the molecular weight range of orosomucoid to IgG but notably higher for α- 2 -macroglobulin.
