500|$|The {{engine was}} <b>disk</b> <b>shaped</b> and its intake was {{positioned}} in the middle, which meant the engine air intakes {{had to be}} located near {{the middle of the}} wing. In the Ace design, these were located just {{to the front of the}} centre on the top and bottom of the aircraft. The cockpit was positioned over the main bearing, behind the intakes. A [...] "spine" [...] on the top and bottom ran from the cockpit area to the rear edge of the aircraft. Several other versions of the basic layout were also studied, including the [...] "Omega" [...] which was more disk-like as it cut away the rear portions of the delta wing as well.|$|E
500|$|The attitude/thrust {{control system}} {{consisted}} of a large ring situated outside of the main <b>disk,</b> <b>shaped</b> roughly like a rounded triangle with the flat surface on the [...] "inside." [...] Viewing the craft from the side, the control flap is almost invisible, appearing in its neutral position to blend into the profile. The pilot's controls moved the ring {{in relation to the}} rest of the craft, affecting the airflow moving outward from the center of the craft. Vertical lift could be increased by moving the entire ring down, which would produce more airflow over its upper surface, which would then bend down over this surface toward the ground. Tilting the ring resulted in asymmetric thrust for directional control.|$|E
500|$|The {{terminal}} inflorescences {{number four}} or five solitary, roughly circular heads per plant. [...] Peduncles are wispy, with bell-shaped involucres measuring 3 to 7 millimeters, and they range from glabrous to short-haired. [...] Like all of its genus, P.bellidiflora has green phyllaries {{in two to three}} generally equal series, lanceolate to obovate, with margins widely scarious (dry and membranous), and a naked receptacle. [...] The yellow corollas are five-lobed, and each of the 16 to 38 <b>disk</b> <b>shaped</b> florets (per head) has linear, acute style tips. They may be slightly red-tinged underneath. [...] Fruits are 1.5 to 3.0 millimeters in diameter and are generally compressed in an oblong to [...] shape; they are typically covered with small hairs. [...] The plant presents fragile pappuses with five or fewer slender bristles, slightly expanded at the base. [...] Flowering season ranges from late March until late June. From a chromosomal standpoint, the species is diploid, (contains one set of chromosomes from each parent), and has 2n=18.|$|E

Two symmetric valve <b>disk</b> <b>shapes</b> namely- a flat rectangular plate and a mid-plane cross-section of a prototype butterfly valve have been studied in the present research. Results showed that in case with spontaneous condensation, the root mean square of pressure oscillation (induced by shock dynamics) is reduced significantly with those without condensation for both shapes of the valves. Moreover, local aerodynamic moments were reduced in case with condensation which {{is considered to be}} beneficial in torque requirement in case of on/off applications of valves as flow control devices. However, total pressure loss was increased with spontaneous condensation in both the valves. Furthermore, the <b>disk</b> <b>shape</b> of a prototype butterfly valve showed better aerodynamic performances compared to flat rectangular plate profile in respect of total pressure loss and vortex shedding frequency in the wake region...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{networks}} of filamentous actin (F-actin) encapsulated inside phosphatidylcholine liposomes {{are currently being}} used {{in an effort to}} model the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. In this article, unilamellar lipid vesicles consisting of egg yolk-derived phosphatidylcholine encapsulating monomeric actin (G-actin) were made via extrusion in low ionic strength buffer (G-buffer). Vesicle shape and structure in these dispersions was studied using a combination of fluid-tapping atomic force microscopy, and multiangle static light scattering. After subjecting the liposome dispersion to high ionic strength polymerization buffer (F-buffer) containing K+ ions, atomic force microscopy imaging and light scattering of these liposomes indicated the formation of specialized structures, including an overall liposome structure transformation from spherical to torus, disk-shaped geometries and tubular assemblies. Several atomic force microscopy control measurements were made to ascertain that the specialized structures formed were not due to free G-actin and F-actin self-assembling on the sample surface, plain liposomes exposed to G- and F-buffer, or liposomes encapsulating G-actin. Liposomes encapsulating G-actin assumed mostly thin <b>disk</b> <b>shapes</b> and some large irregularly shaped aggregates. In contrast, liposomes encapsulating polymerized actin assumed mostly torus or <b>disk</b> <b>shapes</b> along with some high aspect ratio tubular structures...|$|R
