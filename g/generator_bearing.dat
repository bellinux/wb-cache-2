40|$|Hydropower {{and nuclear}} power are the most {{important}} sources of energy in Sweden. Half of Sweden’s total energy production is produced in the hydropower plants along the Swedish rivers. The size of the hydropower units in these power plants varies. The biggest hydropower unit in Sweden, Harsprånget G 5, has a rotating structure that weighs over 1000 ton and generates almost 500 MW. Hydropower units use the kinetic energy of the falling water and transform it to electrical energy. In a hydropower unit as big as the G 5, approximately 500 m 3 water passes through the turbine each second. The enormous flow of water through the turbine and the enormous mass of the rotating structure results in huge loads on the bearings that supports the rotating structure. The characteristics of generator bearings and the loads acting on it has been analysed in this thesis. A method to determine bearing data from measured loads and displacements in the <b>generator</b> <b>bearing</b> has been developed and evaluated. The loads are measured with a method that allows bearing loads to be measured without disassemble the bearing. Disturbances that affect these measurements has also been analysed. MATLAB were used for mathematical computation and analysis. Data measured at the hydropower units were analysed and some disturbances were found. Most of the measured data were affected by 50 and 100 Hz disturbances. To avoid the influence of these disturbances appropriate filters should be used. Some strange frequency characteristics were also found in the measurements performed with the inductive displacement sensors. The huge magnetic field that surrounds the hydropower unit probably affects the inductive displacement sensors. Inductive displacements sensor should therefore be avoided in displacement measurements near generators at hydropower units. It is possible to calculate the bearing data for the <b>generator</b> <b>bearing</b> if the displacements and loads in the <b>generator</b> <b>bearing</b> are measured correctly. The bearing data for the <b>generator</b> <b>bearing</b> is calculated in the generator axles static position. The static position of the generator axle depends of the load cases that affect the hydropower unit.

40|$|Improving the {{reliability}} of wind turbines (WT) is an essential component in the bid to minimize the cost of energy, especially for offshore wind because of the difficulties associated with access for maintenance. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} WT gearbox and generator failure rates are unacceptably high, particularly given the long downtime incurred per failure. There is evidence that bearing failures of the gearbox high-speed stage (HSS) and generator account for a significant proportion of these failures. However, the root causes of these failure data are not known, and there is therefore a need for fundamental computational studies to support the valuable ‘top down’ reliability analyses. In this paper, a real (proprietary) 2 [*]MW geared WT was modelled to compute the gearbox–generator misalignment and predict the impact of this misalignment upon the gearbox HSS and <b>generator</b> <b>bearings.</b> At rated torque, misalignment between the gearbox and generator of 8500 [*]µm was seen. For the 2 [*]MW WT analysed, the computational data show that the L 10 fatigue lives of the gearbox HSS bearings were not significantly affected by this misalignment but that the L 10 fatigue lives of the <b>generator</b> <b>bearings,</b> particularly the drive-end bearing, could be significantly reduced. It is proposed to apply a nominal offset to the generator to reduce the misalignment under operation, thereby reducing the loading on the gearbox HSS and <b>generator</b> <b>bearings.</b> The value of performing integrated system analyses has been demonstrated, and a robust methodology has been outlined...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{possibility}} of incorporating type-ll superconducting materials into engineering power applications such as motors, <b>generators,</b> <b>bearings</b> and levitation systems has attracted much attention. However, in order to fully develop the potential of using these relatively new materials in such applications, suitable computational modelling is required. The {{aim of the research}} presented in this thesis was to further the development of electrical machines incorporating high temperature superconductors (HTSs) by formulating and then implementing mathematical models. After identifying and justifying necessary assumptions, two such models are developed: the first deriving from the ideas of fluxon motion leading to a finite difference scheme, and the second deriving from more fundamental macroscopic ideas of induced currents leading to a finite element formulation. In both cases, the critical state model of type-ll superconductivity is employed and, because of its intrinsic non-linear properties, computational numerical solution techniques are utilised. After validating the modelling techniques with simple problems, and comparing to approximate analytical solutions when available, the remainder of the thesis concerns the modelling of HTS electrical machines and in particular, hysteresis, reluctance, trapped-field and linear motors. In each case, by evaluating the magnetic field and current distributions inside the machine, the roles of the superconducting materials are clearly revealed. Once this has been achieved, further studies indicate the most desirable parameters which are expected to optimise the performance.

Although all new turbines are now fitted with some form of condition monitoring system (CMS), very few operators make use of the available monitoring information for maintenance purposes because of the volume and the complexity of the data. This Thesis is concerned with the development of advanced automatic fault detection techniques so that high on-line diagnostic accuracy for important WT drive train mechanical and electrical CM signals is achieved. Experimental work on small scale WT test rigs is described. Seeded fault tests were performed to investigate gear tooth damage, rotor electrical asymmetry and <b>generator</b> <b>bearing</b> failures. Test rig data were processed by using commercial WT CMSs. Based on the experimental evidence, three algorithms were proposed to aid in the automatic damage detection and diagnosis during WT non-stationary load and speed operating conditions. Uncertainty involved in analysing CM signals with field fitted equipment was reduced, and enhanced detection sensitivity was achieved, by identifying and collating characteristic fault frequencies in CM signals which could be tracked as the WT speed varies. The performance of the gearbox algorithm was validated against datasets of a full-size WT gearbox, that had sustained gear damage, from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) WT Gearbox Condition Monitoring Round Robin project. The fault detection sensitivity of the proposed algorithms was assessed and quantified leading to conclusions about their applicability to operating WTs. ...|$|E

In addition, a multitude of parameters adversely affects the clarity of predictions and setting alarm thresholds. In the article, the authors evaluate the impact of power generator and bearing rotational speed on the root-mean-square (RMS) value received on the <b>generator</b> <b>bearing.</b> The study was performed in various dynamic states of the bearing: the intact and after discovery of damage.

40|$|Wind energy, the world’s {{fastest growing}} {{renewable}} energy technology, is developing towards a major utility source. Turbines are growing {{in size and}} are located in more remote sites, sometimes even offshore, to benefit from better wind conditions. These developments help to maximize the output per turbine but come with challenges for operation and maintenance (O&M). Unexpected failures result in longer downtimes and consequently higher revenue losses. Hence, maintenance management promises consid-erable cost saving potential and the analysis of data form the turbine inbuilt supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system can effectively support maintenance de-cisions. This thesis aims to investigate possibilities to utilize SCADA data for early failure de-tection in critical wind turbines (WTs). Therefore, a condition monitoring approach is further developed and applied. The method uses artificial neural networks to model tar-get parameters under normal operating conditions and analyzes deviations from the measured values {{with the help of}} statistical tools, such as the Mahalanobis distance (MHD) measure. In order to increase the robustness and accuracy of the approach, the development of several data pre-processing methods is presented. Two different anoma-ly detection philosophies are investigated by building two different models.

Firstly, using wavelet packets decomposed the vibration signals into different frequency bands, so extract energy spectrum as a fault feature vector, then put the fault feature vector into the support vector machine training the SVM; Using MATLAB for simulation experimental, put the test sample into the trained SVM for fault pattern recognition, the results show that the fault diagnosis model can make a 93. 3333 % high precision, can make a fast and effective fault diagnosis for rolling bearings. The conclusion is that the fault diagnosis method can recognition the drive system fault, improve the utilization of wind turbines, and it offer a good guide to the operation of wind farm...|$|R
50|$|The German {{relationship}} with Switzerland {{was the most}} complex of all the neutral countries. Expecting hardship, the Swiss government spent heavily in the years prior to World War II on stockpiling food and buying armaments and, anticipating an invasion, kept its forces constantly mobilised. Following the Nazi conquests of mid 1940, the tiny landlocked nation of seven million people, which had remained resolutely neutral since 1815 found itself {{in a very difficult}} position, with German customs officials controlling all gateways to the outside world. But despite veiled threats and the constantly strained relations between the two nations, Switzerland was of no strategic importance to Germany, and of far more use to her as a workshop. Although Swiss citizens largely rejected the Nazis and subscribed to the Internationalist view expressed by the League of Nations, in order to survive and continue to receive imports, Switzerland {{had little choice but to}} trade with Germany, for which she was paid largely in coal. Well-known companies such as Oerlikon-Bührle provided guns, Autophon A.G. provided transmitting apparatus, and other companies exported coal-gas <b>generators,</b> ball <b>bearings,</b> bomb sights, ammunition, carbon black, timepieces and rayon for parachutes.|$|R
