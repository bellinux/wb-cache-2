5|$|Miller noted there {{appeared}} to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured <b>form</b> <b>with</b> darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish <b>form</b> <b>with</b> paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E

40|$|When {{expanded}} through passage, chondrocytes {{lose their}} ability to produce high-quality cartilaginous matrix. This study attempts to improve the properties of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> expanded chondrocytes through alterations in the expansion protocol and the ratio of primary to expanded chondrocytes used to form carti-lage constructs. A chondrogenically tuned expansion protocol provided similar monolayer growth rates as those obtained using serum-containing medium and enhanced cartilaginous properties of resultant constructs. Various ratios of primary to chondrogenically expanded chondrocytes were then self-assembled to form neo-cartilage. Biochemical analysis showed that constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only expanded cells had twice the GAG per wet weight and collagen II/collagen I ratio compared to constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> primary chondrocytes. Biomechanically, compressive properties of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only passaged cells matched the instan-taneous modulus and exceeded the relaxation modulus of constructs <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> only primary cells. These counterintuitive results show that, by applying proper expansion and three-dimensional culture techniques, the cartilage-forming potential of adult chondrocytes expanded through passage can be enhanced over that of primary cells...|$|R

40|$|Solder dip {{may be used}} as a {{peripheral}} leaded terminal refinishing process to replace the original pure tin finish with eutectic tin-lead finish to mitigate tin-whisker risk. Tin-silver-copper is an option of lead-free terminal finish. Solder dip is the way to obtain tin-silver-copper finish. However, the reliability of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> these refinished terminals may be affected by the refinishing process. The solder joint reliability of refinished components under temperature cycling conditions need to be determined to study the effects of refinishing on the solder joint reliability. Tin-bismuth terminal finish is another tin-whisker mitigation strategy. The reliability of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> tin-bismuth finished terminals also needs to be determined before the implementation. The microstructure and strength of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> refinished terminals were evaluated by comparing with those of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> original pure tin finished terminals. The reliability of solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> original pure tin finished terminals, refinished terminals and original tin-bismuth finished terminals were tested under temperature cycling. Under temperature cycling test, solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder dipped terminals have shorter characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> the original pure tin finished terminals in both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. Solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> eutectic SnPb dipped terminals have equal characteristic life for thin-small-outline-packages, but longer characteristic life for 2512 resistors than those <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> the original pure tin finished terminals when reflowed with eutectic SnPb solder. Solder joints <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> tin-bismuth finished terminals have shorter characteristic life than original pure tin finished terminals for thin-small-outline-packages for both eutectic SnPb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assembly. If a 20 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions is acceptable, then the SAC solder dip process can be a potential choice for refinishing purpose. SnPb solder dip process is a good choice of refinish process without causing degradation to characteristic life under temperature cycling conditions. If a 25 % decrease in characteristic life of solder joints under temperature cycling conditions can be accepted, then SnBi finish can be an alternative finish to tin finish...|$|R
