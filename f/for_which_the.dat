5|$|According to Hindu legend Ramanuja (1017–1137), {{the leading}} expounder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, visited the temple.

Thiruvellarai is the birthplace of Uyyakondar, a disciple of Nathamuni. Swami Engalazhwan is believed to have taught Sri Bhasyam to Nadadhoor Ammal in the temple.|$|E

Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.
