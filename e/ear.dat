5|$|The human <b>ear</b> {{consists}} of three parts—the outer <b>ear,</b> middle <b>ear</b> and inner <b>ear.</b> The <b>ear</b> canal of the outer <b>ear</b> is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle <b>ear</b> by the eardrum. The middle <b>ear</b> contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and {{is connected to the}} throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner <b>ear</b> contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal <b>ear</b> canals and low <b>ear</b> implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The <b>ear</b> canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the <b>ear</b> is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the <b>ear</b> canal, as well as the middle and inner <b>ear.</b> Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer <b>ear</b> is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner <b>ear.</b> Inner <b>ear</b> congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner <b>ear</b> anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external <b>ear.</b> Middle <b>ear</b> anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle <b>ear</b> anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and <b>ear</b> canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the <b>ear</b> and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to <b>ear</b> problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the <b>ear</b> can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the <b>ear</b> canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. <b>Ear</b> mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' <b>ear</b> canals.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the <b>ear</b> develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner <b>ear,</b> the middle <b>ear</b> {{and the outer}} <b>ear.</b> Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer <b>ear,</b> are {{modulated}} by the middle <b>ear,</b> and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner <b>ear.</b> This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ears</b> {{are always}} pricked and {{directed}} straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of <b>ears</b> are variable. Generally, <b>ears</b> of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, <b>ears</b> are medium to long. <b>Ears</b> {{can be set}} high and {{close to each other}} or slightly apart.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To explore {{treatments}} for postirradia-tion otitis media with effusion (OME) {{in patients with}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Study Design: This study is a prospective quasi-randomized clinical trial. Methods: Ninety-six patients (135 <b>ears)</b> with OME after the first course of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma were divided into three groups: simple au-ripuncture plus aspiration, tympanic membrane fenes-tration with cauterization, and myringotomy plus grom-met insertion. Cure rates and incidences of complications were compared. Results: Two deaths occurred. The other 94 pa-tients (132 <b>ears)</b> finished a 2 -year follow-up. In group 1, four <b>ears</b> (8. 9 %) were cured after the first treatment and 17 <b>ears</b> overall (37. 8 %) were cured {{by the end of}} the follow-up. Twenty <b>ears</b> (44. 4 %) had persistent fluid, two <b>ears</b> (4. 4 %) developed chronic suppurative otitis media, and five <b>ears</b> (11. 1 %) developed dry eardrum perforation. In group 2, seven <b>ears</b> (15. 6 %) were cured after the first treatment and 21 <b>ears</b> overall (46. 7 %) were cured {{by the end of the}} follow-up. Fourteen <b>ears</b> (31. 1 %) had persistent fluid, three <b>ears</b> (6. 7 %) developed chronic suppurative otitis media, and seven <b>ears</b> (15. 6 %) developed dry ear-drum perforation. In group 3, eight <b>ears</b> (17. 8 %) were cured after the first treatment and 23 <b>ears</b> overall (51. 1 %) were cured by the end of the follow-up. Seven <b>ears</b> (15. 6 %) had persistent fluid, five <b>ears</b> (11. 1 %) developed chronic suppurative otitis media, three <b>ears</b> (6. 7 %) developed ear-drum perforation with effusion, and five <b>ears</b> (11. 1 %) developed dry eardrum perforation. Conclusion: The methods each have advantages and disadvantages. We believe that a step by step ap-proach should be used when choosing the treatment method for postirradiation OME. That is, first apply auripuncture plus aspiration, and then the other methods if this approach is inadequate. Enhanced local care after grommet insertion can effectively reduce the incidence of complications...|$|R

5|$|The middle <b>ear</b> {{lies between}} the outer <b>ear</b> {{and the inner}} <b>ear.</b> It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner <b>ear.</b> The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle <b>ear</b> also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
500|$|Pugs {{have two}} {{distinct}} shapes for their <b>ears,</b> [...] "rose" [...] and [...] "button".

5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine <b>ear</b> infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The <b>ear</b> canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the <b>ear</b> will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of <b>ear</b> infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the <b>ear</b> afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to <b>ear</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|The outer <b>ear</b> is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} <b>ear</b> and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the <b>ear</b> canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the <b>ear</b> canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the <b>ear</b> canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} <b>ear</b> canal is called the concha. The <b>ear</b> canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the <b>ear</b> canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective <b>ear</b> wax. The <b>ear</b> canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the inner <b>ear</b> to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner <b>ear</b> moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle <b>ear.</b> The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|The severed <b>ear</b> that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing <b>ear.</b> Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the <b>ear</b> canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the <b>ear</b> canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own <b>ear</b> as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} <b>ear</b> to develop is the inner <b>ear,</b> which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner <b>ear</b> derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left <b>ear</b> with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the <b>ear</b> in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The <b>ear</b> was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer <b>ear</b> infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, <b>ear</b> fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter <b>ear</b> cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an <b>ear</b> canal blocked by <b>ear</b> wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle <b>ear</b> inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial <b>ear</b> bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
