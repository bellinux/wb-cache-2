5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is now a}} routine research tool with model organisms. For example, genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function. Many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture, <b>industrial</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> and medicine.|$|E

25|$|White {{biotechnology}}, {{also known}} as <b>industrial</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> is biotechnology applied to industrial processes. An example is the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical. Another example is the using of enzymes as industrial catalysts to either produce valuable chemicals or destroy hazardous/polluting chemicals. White biotechnology tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to produce industrial goods.|$|E

25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>biotechnology</b> (known {{mainly in}} Europe as white biotechnology) is the {{application}} of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including industrial fermentation. It includes the practice of using cells such as micro-organisms, or components of cells like enzymes, to generate industrially useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and biofuels. In doing so, biotechnology uses renewable raw materials and may contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.|$|E
25|$|Most of the world's {{synthetic}} {{supply of}} carotene {{comes from a}} manufacturing complex located in Freeport, Texas and owned by DSM. The other major supplier BASF also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene. Together these suppliers account for about 85% of the β-carotene on the market. In Spain Vitatene produces natural β-carotene from fungus Blakeslea trispora, as does DSM but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation. In Australia, organic β-carotene is produced by Aquacarotene Limited from dried marine algae Dunaliella salina grown in harvesting ponds situated in Karratha, Western Australia. BASF Australia is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in Australia that are the world’s largest algae farms. In Portugal, the <b>industrial</b> <b>biotechnology</b> company Biotrend is producing natural all-trans-β-carotene from a non genetically modified bacteria of the Sphingomonas genus isolated from soil.|$|E

2500|$|Founded in 2006, Algenol Biofuels is a global, <b>industrial</b> <b>biotechnology</b> {{company that}} is commercializing its {{patented}} algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels. [...] Based in Southwest Florida, Algenol's patented technology enables {{the production of the}} four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using proprietary algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and saltwater for around $1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year. Algenol's technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources. The company originally intended on producing commercially by 2014, but was set back when Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill in 2013 eliminating the state's mandate of a minimum of 10% ethanol in commercial gasoline. This caused Algenol CEO Paul Woods to scrap a plan for a US $500 million plant to produce commercial amounts of algae biofuels and pursue other job sites. Currently, Algenol is a partner of the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office, and in 2015 began smaller-scale commercial sales of E15 and E85 ethanol blends to Protec Fuel, a Florida-based fuel distributor.|$|E

The negative influence of mercury on growth dynamics of S. platensis was observed. Detoxification of Cr and Hg by Arthrobacter globiformis 151 B was demonstrated. Microbial synthesis of technologically important silver nanoparticles by the novel actinomycete strain Streptomyces glaucus 71 MD and S. platensis was characterized by a combined use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and epithermal neutron activation analysis (ENAA).
