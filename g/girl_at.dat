5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young <b>girl</b> <b>at</b> the age of 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US {{to have a life}} or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip <b>Girl.</b> <b>At</b> the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White <b>Girl.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>at</b> {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick Cowper, the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation could be given for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. Cowper continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing as the person who had called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from Cowper, accused four local women of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>at</b> a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
