40|$|Case StudySix large radial inflow {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to expand isobutane for two electric power plants in Nevada which use heat from the earth (geothermal energy) as the energy source. <b>Double</b> <b>end</b> <b>face</b> mechanical seals lubricated by oil were selected to stop the isobutane from leaking out of the closed loop system and into the atmosphere. Two of the largest providers of mechanical seals in the world provided reference lists showing that this application was pushing the tip speed limits for existing liquid <b>end</b> <b>face</b> mechanical seals. A vendor was selected and the seals were purchased. The first run of the seals on the test stand seemed successful, until the disassembly of the unit revealed the faces were severely overheated and heat checked. The face design was changed and the second test was successful. A major concern was to maintain a low seal leakage rate, so this was measured and was within the specified range. However, the third test resulted in a catastrophic failure of the rotating faces and collateral damage to the entire seal cartridge. Detailed investigation of the failure revealed several interesting problem areas. All of these were addressed in a new design which was implemented, built, and shipped in only one week! The fourth test was successful, but still showed a problem in which the very high velocity oil in the seal chamber was able to dislodge the stationary face retaining ring. A solution to this final problem was implemented and tested successfully. At {{the time of this}} abstract, the seals appear to be successful. Both plants (all six machines) have been placed on line successfully. Two seals experienced damage in the field due to problems with the lube oil filter housings. These problems will be discussed during the presentation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{research}} and master the effect of surface topography on average film thickness between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for mechanical seals, average film thickness fractal model between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for mechanical seal was established using fractal parameters charactering surface topography characteristics, based on contact fractal model of the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> for mechanical seal, and solving micro-void volume. Effect of surface topography fractal parameters on average film thickness between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for B 104 a- 70 mechanical seal was analyzed by theoretical calculation. The results showed that fractal dimension D and characteristic length scale G of the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> had a great influence on the average film thickness h 0, and h 0 decreased with the increased of D or decreased of G; h 0 decreased rapidly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was coarser, however, it decreased slowly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was smoother. In normal working parameters and surface topography fractal parameters range, average film thickness between <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was {{in the range of}} 0. 27 ~ 1. 7 µm. Studying on the effect of the change of surface topography on average film thickness has an important significance on the predicting of operating characteristics of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> during actual operating and the design of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for contact mechanical seal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> are {{separated}} by a thin fluid film. The thickness of this film must be optimized so as to preventing the serious friction of two <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and minimizing the fluid leakage. The micro scope condition monitoring of <b>end</b> <b>face</b> is of importance to ensure mechanical seals run normally. A method for measuring the film thickness of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and detecting the friction of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> of mechanical seal has been presented in this paper. Eddy current sensors embedded in the stationary ring of mechanical seals are used to directly measure {{the thickness of the}} liquid-lubricated film. The Eddy current signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition into a series of intrinsic mode function. The information reflecting the film thickness is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. Acoustic emission sensor placed on the lateral of stationary ring i...|$|R
