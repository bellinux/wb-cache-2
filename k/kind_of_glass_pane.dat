40|$|<b>Glass</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} common and {{important}} evidence submitted to forensic laboratories for analysis. It is frequently encountered at crime scenes, particularly those involving motor vehicle accidents or burglaries. This study emphasized on the examination of the fracture patterns performed on different types <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> after broken by different type of impact objects, analysis of fracture features to determine direction of force and identifying of refractive index <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> as further analysis. Three types <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> (float, tempered and laminated) and four levels of breaking devices (hammer, bat, golf ball and stone either by throwing or using catapult) were used in the experiment. The results show that almost the whole float <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> were shatters into sharp glass pieces after broken by all type of breaking devices. Then, tempered <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> was broken with the whole <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> shatters into small pieces of blunt granules when only hammer exerted on the glass, meanwhile, for other breaking devices were caused a scratch marks on glass surface. For laminated glass when broken by bat, throwing a stone and using catapult, almost the whole <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> were remains intact on its interlayer film and got some splinters from point of impact were flying out. Meanwhile, fracture patterns on laminated <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> when broken by hammer produced a cone or crater after striking. However, impact objects used to break those types <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are not really reliable to be distinguished. This is because the fracture patterns on <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> obviously differ by its types <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> only. When a <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> is broken by an impact, majority of the broken fragments will fall {{in the direction of the}} force, which is on the side <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> opposite direction <b>of</b> the application of force. A determination of the direction of force in breaking a <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> can be determined by the direction of the rib marks. As the impact occurs, concentric fractures form around the impact and interconnect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. The edge of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that describe the direction of the blow. The refractive index of each type <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> was determined by GRIM 3 equipment which produce results of refractive index for float <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5200; tempered <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5181 and, laminated <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are about 1. 5188...|$|R

40|$|The author {{discusses}} the use <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> as transparent stability elements in vertical faÃ§ade structures subjected to in-plane loads including temperature loads. In the present faÃ§ade architecture, glass is normally used non-structural. The only mechanical requirement is to resist transversal loads, which determines the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Thus, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> {{are not used}} to stabilize the structural system. However, <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> have excellent in-plane stiffness qualities, and providing appropriate connections between glass and the supporting structure, this in-plane stiffness can possibly attribute to the buildingâ€™s stability. Temperature loads on the glass avoid making a totally stiff connection between glass and structure, whereas this would be required for the stability aspect. To investigate this problem, this paper presents two conceptual connection designs between glass and structure. For temperature loads, these connections will be studied using the theory of plates. It is shown that a bond line as connection, having a large stiffness directly leads to a uniformly distribution equal to almost the complete temperature load. If the shear stiffness of the bond line is taken into account, a complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> occurs, even for a geometrical and physical linear approach. Thus, the impact of the temperature loads is significant for all <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> (plate level) and is independent on faÃ§ade size and this in contrast with the collaboration <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> and supporting structure to resist laterally mechanical loads (structure level). Research will continue with experiments to verify the theoretical derived results and with the development of finite element models to study the complex stress pattern in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane,</b> dependent on connection type and load case...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>panes</b> {{structurally}} {{bonded to}} a steel framework {{can be used}} as a stability system for buildings. A system built up <b>of</b> a single <b>glass</b> <b>pane,</b> a steel frame and a glued joint is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three glued joint types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> The applied criteria are the strength <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> is the criterion and is located on the <b>glass</b> <b>pane's</b> surface in the vicinity of the glued joint which anchors the tensile diagonal <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the glued joint (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame. However, the stress distribution in the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> as well as in the glued joint is unfavourable for systems with one-sided rigid joint. The two-sided rigid glued joint is a promising joint type based on the geometric parameters <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> and the good residual capacity after the first cracks as observed in the experiments...|$|R
5000|$|If the {{temperature}} in the building is higher than {{the temperature}} outside, the heat leaks through the elements of construction. Windows are usually the most vulnerable elements of the building in terms of heat losses. The heat loss though window constructions is about 20-25% of total heat loss. Heat insulation of translucent constructions can be improved by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>glasses</b> and chambers <b>of</b> multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes,</b> but will result in increased construction cost and decreased optical transmission. The reasonable alternative is the usage <b>of</b> low-emissivity <b>glass,</b> which is practically the same as ordinary <b>glass</b> in terms <b>of</b> optical transmission, but it also reflects the heat radiation back into the room. The major indicator which characterizes the ability <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> to reflect heat radiation is its emissivity (E) or the [...] "emission factor". The emission factor <b>of</b> ordinary <b>glass</b> is 0.83; the factor for low-emissive glass can reach 0.03, so that more than 90% of accumulated heat will be reflected back into the room. The lower the emission factor is, the more effective is the material to reflect the heat, and the more heat it will accumulate. To compare, the emission factor <b>of</b> a multiple <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> with two chambers, which is made <b>of</b> ordinary <b>glass,</b> {{is the same as the}} emission factor <b>of</b> a multiple <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> with one chamber, which was produced with usage <b>of</b> low-emissive <b>glass.</b> Besides energy-efficient functions in cold seasons of the year, low-emissive glass possesses the ability to reflect the excess of outside heat energy in summer seasons; the optical transmission coefficient is affected insignificantly in this way. The additional factor of reduce of heat transfer <b>of</b> multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> is the usage of low thermal conductivity gases - Ar or Kr - to fill the chambers. In present-day multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> Ar is more often used, which helps to reduce heat losses by 10-20%, though the cost <b>of</b> multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> is insignificantly increased.|$|R
