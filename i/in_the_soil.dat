5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> With adequate zinc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard).

Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke.
