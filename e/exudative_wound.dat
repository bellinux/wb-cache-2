30|$|In our department, we induced NPWT in the {{treatment}} of <b>exudative</b> <b>wound</b> in September 2012 at first time and experienced the dramatic effect. Accumulating a successful experience, we gradually expanded the indications for NPWT. And in November 2013, we applied NPWT from just after the abdominal surgery. Because we could confirm the safety and usefulness of the wound treatment applying negative pressure from just after abdominal surgeries, we decided to induce this method in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the method we {{performed}} {{in this case}} requires frequent foam exchanges and stepwise closure of the wound site. After contaminated abdominal surgery, {{a large amount of}} exudate generates from the wound site with this method, applying NPWT without primary skin closure, and surgeons need to respond promptly to troubles such as obstruction of the foam tube or bleeding. For the wound site is closed with dressing, once the bacteria proliferate in the wound site, the foam and drainage tube easily becomes obstructed and the condition of the wound site gets worse and this method rather promotes infection. In order to avoid complications, surgeons need to observe the wound site carefully and frequently. However, if appropriate countermeasures such as increasing the frequency of foam replacement are taken, these troubles can basically be overcome. In facilities that newly introduce NPWT, it is necessary to experience success cases with treatment for <b>exudative</b> <b>wound</b> and expand the indication gradually.|$|E
40|$|In this research, we {{contributed to}} the search for {{potential}} hydrogel-silver dressings by generating hydrogel-silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) composites prepared by the dipping of the crosslinked hydrogel poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone-co- 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonate sodium) (1 : 1) and poly(acrylamide-co- 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonate sodium) (1 : 1) into an aqueous suspension of citrate-stabilized AgNPs. The composites obtained were evaluated by an antibacterial activity assay on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and subjected to an in vitro cytotoxicity assay for human fibroblasts. The composite formed from the hydrogel poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone-co- 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonate sodium) with 3 mol % N,N-methylene bisacrylamide showed the highest antibacterial activity and the least cytotoxicity among the composites tested; this makes it an excellent alternative as a potential dressing for the treatment of deep and <b>exudative</b> <b>wounds.</b> Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Treatment of wounds using {{conventional}} methods {{is frequently}} limited by inadequate local wound conditions, or by a poor systemic clinical situation. Vacuum system may promote faster granulation tissue formation, remove excessive exudate, increase blood {{flow in the}} wound, and attract {{the borders of the}} wound to the center, reducing its dimension. We present 3 cases of patients with difficult wounds, due to bad local conditions, or poor clinical situation, in whom we used a vacuum system to prepare the wound for the surgical closure. One patient had a pressure ulcer, another had a diabetic foot ulcer, and the third one had an open foot stump. In the 3 cases a significant improvement of the wound conditions was achieved after 7 to 8 days, allowing successful surgical treatment with flap or skin grafts. DESCRIPTORS: Wound. Healing. Vacuum.

40|$|The {{adsorbent}} {{properties of}} important wound fluid proteins and cotton cellulose are reviewed. This review {{focuses on the}} adsorption of albumin to cotton-based wound dressings and some chemically modified derivatives targeted for chronic wounds. Adsorption of elastase {{in the presence of}} albumin was examined as a model to understand the interactive properties of these wound fluid components with cotton fibers. In the chronic non-healing wound, elastase appears to be over-expressed, and it digests tissue and growth factors, interfering with the normal healing process. Albumin is the most prevalent protein in wound fluid, and in highly to moderately <b>exudative</b> <b>wounds,</b> it may bind significantly to the fibers of wound dressings. Thus, the relative binding properties of both elastase and albumin to wound dressing fibers are of interest in the design of more effective wound dressings. The present work examines the binding of albumin to two different derivatives of cotton, and quantifies the elastase binding to the same derivatives following exposure of albumin to the fiber surface. An HPLC adsorption technique was employed coupled with a colorimetric enzyme assay to quantify the relative binding properties of albumin and elastase to cotton. The results of wound protein binding are discussed in relation to the porosity and surface chemistry interactions of cotton and wound proteins. Studies are directed to understanding the implications of protein adsorption phenomena in terms of fiber-protein models that have implications for rationally designing dressings for chronic wounds...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the clinical, pathological and microbiological findings of an uncommon infection in a cat by Nocardia nova. A 3 -year-old male domestic short hair cat with an ulcerated and <b>exudative</b> cutaneous <b>wound</b> was presented for clinical examination. Samples were collected for histopathology and bacteriology diagnosis. Microscopically, the lesion {{was diagnosed as}} pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis with large and irregular colonies of branching filamentous bacterium. Skin bacteriological culture showed gram-positive rods and partially acid-fast branching filaments by gram and kinyoun staining, respectively. The identity of Nocardia nova was confirmed by 16 S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. This is the first case of pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis in a cat caused byNocardia nova reported in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|To {{measure the}} exudative {{cutaneous}} copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) losses in burns, 10 patients, aged 36 +/- 9 years (mean +/- s. d.) with burns covering 33 +/- 10 per {{cent of the}} total body surface area, were studied from the first postburn day (D 1) until D 7. All intakes and losses were analysed for Cu, Zn and nitrogen (N) content. Cutaneous losses were extracted from textiles surrounding the patients. Urinary excretions were 0. 12 +/- 0. 06 mg/ 24 h for Cu, 0. 9 +/- 0. 6 mg/ 24 h for Zn, and 14. 1 +/- 4. 4 g/ 24 h for N. Mean daily <b>exudative</b> losses through <b>wound</b> seepage from D 1 to D 7 were 4. 7 +/- 2. 1 mg/ 24 h for Cu, 27. 1 +/- 14. 4 mg/ 24 h for Zn, and 8. 7 +/- 3. 8 g/ 24 h for N. The cumulated mean losses over 7 days were 37 mg for Cu, and 212 mg for Zn, representing respectively 20 - 40 per cent and 5 - 10 per cent of normal body content. Serum Cu and Zn levels were strongly depressed. The urinary Cu/N ratios correlated with clinical improvement. We conclude that the exudative Cu and Zn losses {{during the first week}} postburn contribute significantly to the increased nutrient requirements in burns...|$|R
