50|$|The {{functional}} group, the spacer and the lipid tail {{components of}} the FSL construct can each be individually designed resulting in FSL constructs with specific biological functions. The functional head group is usually the bioactive component of the construct and the various spacers and lipids influence and effect its presentation, orientation and location on a surface. Critical {{to the definition of}} an FSL construct is the requirement to be <b>dispersible</b> in water, and spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. Other lipid bioconjugates that include components similar to FSLs but do not have these features are not termed as Function-Spacer-Lipid constructs.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic soda (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL {{is a mixture of}} sodium salts of stearoyl lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10-12. SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and <b>dispersible</b> in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.|$|E
5000|$|Although a {{terrorist}} organization might obtain radioactive material through the [...] "black market", {{and there has been}} a steady increase in illicit trafficking of radioactive sources from 1996 to 2004, these recorded trafficking incidents mainly refer to rediscovered orphan sources without any sign of criminal activity, and it has been argued that there is no conclusive evidence for such a market. In addition to the hurdles of obtaining usable radioactive material, there are several conflicting requirements regarding the properties of the material the terrorists need to take into consideration: First, the source should be [...] "sufficiently" [...] radioactive to create direct radiological damage at the explosion or at least to perform societal damage or disruption. Second, the source should be transportable with enough shielding to protect the carrier, but not so much that it will be too heavy to maneuver. Third, the source should be sufficiently <b>dispersible</b> to effectively contaminate the area around the explosion.|$|E
5000|$|The Optimum Water Content of soil is {{the water}} content {{at which a}} maximum dry unit weight can be {{achieved}} after a given compaction effort. A max dry unit weight would have no voids in the soil. If {{you were trying to}} compact a hard dry soil to make it more dense, you might want to get it wet. The OPT is the water content of the soil in which you could compact it the most. If there is too much water you would have too much pore water pressure during compression to compact any further. If there is too little water the soil would naturally resist compaction via shear strength/friction/effective stress. The determination of the OPT is important because if tillage is carried out on fields that are wetter or drier than the OPT many problems can be caused, including soil structural damage, through the production of large clods, and an increase in the content of readily <b>dispersible</b> clay which is indicative of the soil stability.|$|E
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{manufacturers}} make amoxicillin in trihydrate form, for {{oral use}} available as capsules, regular, chewable and <b>dispersible</b> tablets, syrup and pediatric suspension {{for oral use}}, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration. Amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally. The liquid forms are helpful where the patient might {{find it difficult to}} take tablets or capsules.Intravenous form is not sold in USA. In the USA when amoxicillin is needed intravenously, it is usually accomplished by adding amoxicillin powder to bags of Saline Solution. There are small saline bags that have a screw off cap on the top of them to allow the powder to be added, commonly called piggy back bags by medical staff. Powdered Amoxicillin can be mixed with saline solution or sterile water to be used in a syringe, but because of the slow delivery time that is needed to inject the solution (3-4 minutes for solution containing 1g of amoxicillin powder) this method is seldom used.Ampicillin can also be used instead of amoxicillin when person can't swallow and needs antibiotics as it has the same spectrum as amoxicillin.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Ligand exchange=== As-synthesized UCNPs {{are usually}} capped with organic ligands that aid {{in size and}} shape control during preparation. These ligands make their surface {{hydrophobic}} and hence are not <b>dispersible</b> in aqueous solution, preventing their biological applications. One simple method to increase solubility in aqueous solvents is direct ligand exchange. This requires a more favored ligand to replace the initial ones. The hydrophobic native ligand capping the NP during synthesis (usually a long chain molecule like oleic acid) is directly substituted with a more polar hydrophilic one, which are usually multi chelating (e.g. poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-phosphate, poly(acrylic acid)) and hence provides better stabilisation/ binding resulting in their exchange. A shortcoming of this method is the slow kinetics associated with the exchange. Generally the new ligand is also functionalized with a group like thiol that allows for facile binding to the NP surface. The protocol for direct exchange is simple, generally involving mixing {{for an extended period}} of time, but the work-up can be tedious, conditions must be optimized for each system, and aggregation may occur However the two-step process of ligand exchange involves the removal of original ligands followed by coating hydrophilic ones, which is a better method. The ligand removal step here was reported through various ways. A simple way was wash the particles with ethanol under ultrasonic treatment. Reagents like NOBF4 or acids are used to strip the native ligands off of the NP surface to attach favorable ones later on. This method shows less tendency for NP aggregation than the direct exchange, and can be generalized to other types of nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} tablet hardness and homogeneity of different Yinhuang <b>dispersible</b> tablets by near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) technology.
