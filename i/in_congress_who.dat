5|$|The NCTA's November 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report {{included}} {{a proposal for}} an 89-mile (143km), $793 million rail system. The {{total cost of the}} proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> reduced the rail system to only 23-miles (37km) within the District of Columbia. However, that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy's death. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban mass transportation projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a 25-mile (40km) rapid transit system.|$|E

500|$|Some colonies {{held back}} from {{endorsing}} independence. Resistance was {{centered in the}} middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, {{it was believed that}} the others would follow. On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the Pennsylvania Assembly in a special election that had focused on the question of independence. In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and Richard Henry Lee, calling on colonies without a [...] "government sufficient to the [...] of their affairs" [...] to adopt new governments. The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's John Dickinson, the leader of the anti-independence faction <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>who</b> believed that it did not apply to his colony.|$|E
500|$|The defiant Whig Congress {{would not}} raise tariffs {{in a way}} that would affect the {{distribution}} of funds to states. In June 1842 they passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program. Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff, Tyler vetoed both bills, burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs. Congress tried again, combining the two into one bill; Tyler vetoed it again, to the dismay of many <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>who</b> nevertheless failed to override the veto. [...] As some action was necessary, Whigs in Congress, led by the House Ways and Means chairman Millard Fillmore, passed in each house (by one vote) a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program. Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30, pocket vetoing a separate bill to restore distribution.|$|E
500|$|On September 10 in Springfield, Illinois, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} Republican Senator Ralph Smith, Agnew began his campaign, which would be noted for harsh rhetoric and memorable phrases. Agnew attacked the [...] "pusillanimous pussyfooting" [...] of the liberals, including those <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>who</b> Agnew said cared nothing for the blue- and white-collar workers, the [...] "Forgotten Man of American politics". Addressing the California Republican Convention in San Diego, Agnew targeted [...] "the nattering nabobs of negativism.

[...] He warned that candidates of any party who espoused radical views should be voted out, a reference to New York Senator Charles Goodell, who was on the ballot that November, and who opposed the Vietnam War. Believing that the strategy was working, Nixon met with Agnew at the White House on September 24, and urged him to continue.|$|E

The Chillicothe Gazette would salute him for his work on funding for U.S. Route 35, a limited access highway linking Chillicothe to Dayton.

The [...] "Second New Deal" [...] was heavily criticized by the Republicans <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>who</b> likened it to class warfare and socialism.

However, several factors over the next thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the League's aims. Among those Muslims <b>in</b> the <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> did not initially join the League was Jinnah, a prominent statesman and barrister in Bombay.

2500|$|Dean {{began his}} {{campaign}} by emphasizing {{health care and}} fiscal responsibility, and championing grassroots fundraising {{as a way to}} fight lobby groups. However, his opposition to the U.S. plan to invade Iraq (and his forceful criticism of Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> voted to authorize the use of force) quickly eclipsed other issues. By challenging the war in Iraq at a time when mainstream Democratic leaders were either neutral or cautiously supportive, Dean positioned himself to appeal to his party's activist base. Dean often quoted the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone (who had recently died in a plane crash) as saying that he represented [...] "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party." [...] His message resonated among frustrated Democratic primary voters who felt that their party hadn't done enough to oppose the policies of the Republicans. Thus, Dean also succeeded in differentiating himself from his primary opponents.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1914, Representative Charles Creighton Carlin of Virginia {{sponsored}} {{legislation to}} replace Aqueduct Bridge with a new, $1 million structure.

There were some <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> wanted to repair the existing bridge, but a study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in August 1914 showed that the existing structure was inadequate for the amount of traffic and too unstable to be saved.

2500|$|But {{his most}} {{important}} decision came in the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had negotiated contracts eight times, and each time a strike action of varying length had occurred. By the spring of 1994, {{the possibility of a}} strike was rising, as owners and players argued over a salary cap, revenue-sharing (which would [...] "tax" [...] the sport's top money-making teams and redistribute the funds to the weakest teams), and the extent of salary arbitration. The NLRB was closely monitoring the situation, (in no small part because Chairman Gould was an avid baseball fan). On July 28, the MLBPA set a deadline of August 12, 1994, for a new collective bargaining agreement or it would strike. The strike began on August 12, but despite the appointment of former Secretary of Labor William Usery, Jr. as a special mediator on October 13 the World Series was cancelled {{for the first time in}} history. On December 22, the owners unilaterally imposed a salary cap and eliminated salary arbitration. On Christmas Eve, MLB announced it would start spring training with strikebreaker players. Two days later, the owners and the players' association both filed unfair labor practice (ULP) complaints with the NLRB, with each side claiming the other had not negotiated in good faith. Meanwhile, the NLRB had initiated its own investigation into the strike (led by NLRB Regional Director Dan Silverman and NLRB General Counsel Fred Feinstein). The key issue for the board was whether the legal rules of negotiation had been followed. Under American labor law, the employer is permitted to implement its last offer if an impasse had been reached. But the two sides had been negotiating since November, and it was not entirely clear that an impasse had been reached. Congress was considering legislation to make baseball subject to United States antitrust law, and on January 26 President Bill Clinton announced that the two sides would have to make major progress to an agreement by February 6 or the federal government would intervene. On February 3, the owners unilaterally lifted their salary cap. But with no agreement even close, Usery hinted that he would recommend a legislative solution (perhaps removing the antitrust exemption, perhaps imposing binding arbitration) to the President. But Republicans <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> (<b>who</b> had just won control of the House and Senate) signaled they would not enact any such legislation.|$|E
