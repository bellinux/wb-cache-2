40|$|The Internet {{is often}} {{thought to be}} a model of resilience, due to a decentralised, organically-grown architecture. This paper puts this {{perception}} into perspective through the results of a security analysis of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing infrastructure. BGP is a fundamental Internet protocol and its intrinsic fragilities have been highlighted extensively in the literature. A seldom studied aspect is how robust the BGP infrastructure actually is as a result of nearly three decades of perpetual growth. Although global black-outs seem unlikely, local security events raise growing concerns on the robustness of the backbone. In order to better protect this critical infrastructure, it is crucial to understand its topology {{in the context of the}} weaknesses of BGP and to identify possible security scenarios. Firstly, we establish a comprehensive threat model that classifies main attack vectors, including but non limited to BGP vulnerabilities. We then construct maps of the <b>European</b> BGP <b>backbone</b> based on publicly available routing data. We analyse the topology of the backbone and establish several disruption scenarios that highlight the possible consequences of different types of attacks, for different attack capabilities. We also discuss existing mitigation and recovery strategies, and we propose improvements to enhance the robustness and resilience of the backbone. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine a comprehensive threat analysis of BGP infrastructures withadvanced network topology considerations. We find that the BGP infrastructure is at higher risk than already understood, due to topologies that remain vulnerable to certain targeted attacks as a result of organic deployment over the years. Significant parts of the system are still uncharted territory, which warrants further investigation in this direction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ecological {{indicator}} values (EIVs) have a {{long tradition}} in vegetation ecological research in Europe. EIVs characterise the ecological optimum of species along major environmental gradients using ordinal scales. Calculating mean indicator values per plot is an effective way of bioindication. Following first systems in Russia and Central Europe, about two dozen EIV systems have been published for various parts of Europe. Aims: As there was no EIV system available at European scale {{that could be used}} for broad-scale analyses, e. g. in the context of the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), we develop such a system for the first time for the vascular plants of Europe. Location: Europe. Methods: We compiled all national and major regional EIV systems and harmonized their plant nomenclature with a newly developed contemporary <b>European</b> taxonomic <b>backbone</b> (EuroSL 1. 0). Using regression, we rescaled the individual EIV systems for the main parameters to continent-wide quasi-metric scales, ranging from 1 to 99. The data from each individual system were then translated into a probability curve approximated with a normal distribution, weighed with the logarithm of the area represented and summed up across the systems. From the European density curve we extracted then a mean and a variance, which characterise the distribution of this species along this particular ecological gradient. Results and conclusions: Our consensus approach of integrating the expert knowledge of all existing EIV systems allowed deriving the first consistent description of the ecological behaviour for a significant part of the European vascular flora. The resulting Ecological Indicator Values of Europe (EIVE) 1. 0 will be published open access to allow bioindication beyond country borders. Future releases of EIVE might contain more parameters, non-vascular plants and regionalisation or could be re-adjusted and extended to hitherto non-covered species through co-occurrence data from EVA...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} the geographic analysis of the Internet infrastructure and its impacts on the economic development of the city-regions. The starting point for this research is the infrastructural attributes of the Internet which enables it to facilitate the modern – and rapidly expanded – digital economy by transporting its informational goods and services. In order to approach this research subject a wide range of quantitative methods is employed: from network analysis and complex network theory to principal components and cluster analysis as well as panel data analysis and Granger causality test. The empirical research is firstly focused on analysing the urban economic geography of the Internet backbone network in Europe. In order to better understand the geography and the topology of the Internet backbone network, a structural comparison with the aviation networks in Europe also takes place. Secondly, effort is spent in highlighting the determinant geographic and socio-economic factors behind the distribution of this Internet infrastructure across the European city-regions. Thirdly, this study examines the impact of the – unevenly distributed – Internet infrastructure on the economic development of the European city-regions. The above empirical analysis highlighted the unequal distribution of the Internet infrastructure and mostly the Internet capacity across the European cities. Different roles were identified for different cities, but over time the golden diamond of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt appears to be the core of the <b>European</b> Internet <b>backbone</b> network, with London being the dominant hub. However, no clear evidence for scale free attributes was identified. Moreover, the analysis demonstrated that the level of development, the services and the knowledge economy, the spatial structure as well as the physical transport and accessibility level are significant predictors of the distribution of the Internet infrastructure. In addition, the econometric modelling concluded that the Internet infrastructure is a significant predictor of the economic development of the city-regions and that the causality runs from the Internet infrastructure to the regional economic development. Even more interesting is the geographic analysis of the causality direction as an almost north-south pattern emerged, with the northern city-regions in Europe being more efficient in exploiting the installed Internet infrastructure. The latter can be used as an evidence for the inclusion of the Internet infrastructure in the local and regional economic development agenda. However, a set of other framework condition should be also present in order for the Internet infrastructure to {{have a positive impact on}} the regional economic development.

50|$|Although {{the exact}} date of its {{construction}} is still unknown, the Hohenstadt Transmission Tower {{stands on a}} land that has undergone several notable events {{in the history of}} the municipality. The land, about 2 to 3 acres, was originally leased by the U.S. Government in 1950. Abandoned former military facilities surrounding the tower were first utilized by the USAF (United States Air Force) mobile relay equipment units as trucks and vehicle shelters in 1951. In 1954, the 315th Signal Bn (later the 102nd Signal Bn) established a VHF relay on the site and built permanent housing for 6 staff members, including a security fence. Additionally, a diesel generator in a small shed was erected. The relay was part of the USAREUR Multi-channel Radio Telephone Network which provided Class A telephones and teletype services throughout Europe. Two towers, that were 30.48 m in height, were utilized by the military, facing southeast toward Hohenpeißenberg and northwest toward Stuttgart. Additionally, a 53.34-metre-tall antenna tower was erected at that point by the USAF. By 1967, the Army system became obsolete and was thus, replaced by a Tropospheric scatter microwave equipment which was part of the Digital <b>European</b> <b>Backbone</b> system (DEB). Afterwards in the same year, the 102nd Signal Bn abandoned the site and dismantled the two towers, although the DEB and the third antenna tower were maintained by the 69th Signal Bn and utilized a new and more innovative 60.96-metre-tall tower that possesses multiple parabolic reflector antennas. From 1967 up until the present time, numerous military systems and units utilized the location since it was a valuable high-ground location for communication relays. This necessitated three new buildings on the site.|$|E
40|$|Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty on the European Union (February 1992) has {{presented}} the Commission with new responsibilities {{in the field}} of Public Health. In several policy documents evaluating this new mandate the need to coordinate policy and programme development and stimulate collaboration between Member States has been stressed. The importance of consultation and participation mechanisms, using a variety of organisations and networks, is also seen as essential. The actions of the EU will focus on the harmonised collection, evaluation and dissemination of health information, on the mutual exchange of know-how and experience between Member States and, eventually, on the definition of common health policy objectives and strategies. To support these actions a European Public Health Status and Forecast (PHSF) report is proposed, comprising: - a comprehensive, explanatory and comparative analysis of health status in the EU - Public Health forecasts for major health issues, based on demographic extrapolation,trend analysis and dynamic system analysis. This document presents the outline for a such a policy-oriented, comprehensive PHSF report, which must be produced as a collaborative, <b>European,</b> effort. The <b>backbone</b> of the proposed PHSF report is a conceptual model that describes the various components of Public Health and their interrelationships. A systematic line of analysis is devised to arrive at a comparative assessment of major aspects of health status and their determinants in the EU and its Member States. This analysis will produce an appreciation of important trends in major health issues, an estimate of the changing impact of underlying causes and, finally, an appraisal of the future health gains that can be expected to result from a range of policy options. In this approach aggregated health measures, such as health expectancy will be assessed incorporating other data (e. g. on cause-specific mortality, on morbidity and quality of life) and, where possible, linked to determinants of health. The added value of a successful PHSF exercise will be the establishment of a comprehensive, uniform and consistent data structure containing health indicators tailored to the European situation. This will assist Member States in undertaking cooperative ventures {{in the field of}} Public Health. The report will expand on information collected previously in descriptive documents and contribute to regular reporting on Public Health in the EU, a necessity already recognized by the Commission. In a feasibility study following this outline a number of the issues addressed here will be elaborated in more detail. Key institutions and networks active in collecting, analysing and comparing international health data will be identified. Expert collaborators must be involved and data requirements and sources must be specified.

40|$|This {{essay is}} about the “Blue Banana”. Banana is the name given {{subsequently}} by others to a Dorsale européenne (<b>European</b> <b>backbone)</b> identified empirically by Roger Brunet. In a background study to the Communication of the European Commission ‘Europe 2000 ’, Klaus Kunzmann and Michael Wegener put forward the allegedly radical alternative called the “European Bunch of Grapes”. However, the juxtaposition is questionable, and for two reasons. Firstly, Brunet’s frame of reference was France and his point was that, other than how Kunzmann and Wegener present it, his Dorsale barely straddled French territory. It was thus an indictment of the dominant position of Paris and not a comment on European development. Secondly, and importantly, Brunet portrayed the Dorsale as a polycentric urban network with features similar to those which Kunzmann and Wegener ascribe to their Bunch of Grapes. So {{the implications of the}} two concepts for European development are the same: Much like the Bunch of Grapes, the Dorsale celebrates, if not urban networks as such, then the particular network in the Rhineland for forming the basis for its prosperity. If it had been the intention of Brunet to make recommendations applicable at the European scale, arguably he would have done much as Kunzmann and Wegener have: recommend polycentric development.

Physicists are using LHC {{to recreate the}} conditions just after the Big Bang, by colliding two beams of particles and heavy ions head-on at very high energy.

This data is sent out from CERN to eleven Tier 1 academic institutions in Europe, Asia, and North America using a multi-gigabits Optical Private Network (OPN), the LHCOPN. Network monitoring on such complex network architecture to ensure robust and reliable operation is of crucial importance. The chosen approach for monitoring the OPN {{is based on the}} perfSONAR MDM framework ([URL] which is designed for multi-domain monitoring environments. perfSONAR (www. perfsonar. net) is an infrastructure for performance monitoring data exchange between networks, making it easier to solve performance problems occurring between network measurement points interconnected through several network domains. It contains a set of services delivering performance measurements in a multi-domain environment. These services act as an intermediate layer, between the performance measurement tools and the visualization applications. This layer is aimed at exchanging performance measurements between networks, using well defined protocols. perfSONAR is web-service based, modular, and it uses NM-WG OGF standards. perfSONAR MDM is the perfSONAR version built by GÉANT (www. geant. net), the consortium operating the <b>European</b> <b>Backbone</b> for research and education.

40|$|Network {{monitoring}} {{has always}} been a topic of foremost importance for both network operators and researchers for multiple reasons ranging from anomaly detection to tra c classi cation or capacity planning. Nowadays, as networks become more and more complex, tra c increases and security threats reproduce, achieving a deeper understanding of {{what is happening in the}} network has become an essential necessity. In particular, due to the considerable growth of cybercrime, research on the eld of anomaly detection has drawn signi cant attention in recent years and tons of proposals have been made. All the same, when it comes to deploying solutions in real environments, some of them fail to meet some crucial requirements. Taking this into account, this thesis focuses on lling this gap between the research and the non-research world. Prior to the start of this work, we identify several problems. First, there is a clear lack of detailed and updated information on the most common anomalies and their characteristics. Second, unawareness of sampled data is still common although the performance of anomaly detection algorithms is severely a ected. Third, operators currently need to invest many work-hours to manually inspect and also classify detected anomalies to act accordingly and take the appropriate mitigation measures. This is further exacerbated due to the high number of false positives and false negatives and because anomaly detection systems are often perceived as extremely complex black boxes. Analysing an issue is essential to fully comprehend the problem space and to be able to tackle it properly. Accordingly, the rst block of this thesis seeks to obtain detailed and updated real-world information on the most frequent anomalies occurring in backbone networks. It rst reports on the performance of di erent commercial systems for anomaly detection and analyses the types of network nomalies detected. Afterwards, it focuses on further investigating the characteristics of the anomalies found in a backbone network using one of the tools for more than half a year. Among other results, this block con rms the need of applying sampling in an operational environment as well as the unacceptably high number of false positives and false negatives still reported by current commercial tools. On the whole, the presence of ampling in large networks for monitoring purposes has become almost mandatory and, therefore, all anomaly detection algorithms that do not take that into account might report incorrect results. In the second block of this thesis, the dramatic impact of sampling on the performance of well-known anomaly detection techniques is analysed and con rmed. However, we show that the results change signi cantly depending on the sampling technique used and also on the common metric selected to perform the comparison. In particular, we show that, Packet Sampling outperforms Flow Sampling unlike previously reported. Furthermore, we observe that Selective Sampling (SES), a sampling technique that focuses on small ows, obtains much better results than traditional sampling techniques for scan detection. Consequently, we propose Online Selective Sampling, a sampling technique that obtains the same good performance for scan detection than SES but works on a per-packet basis instead of keeping all ows in memory. We validate and evaluate our proposal and show that it can operate online and uses much less resources than SES. Although the literature is plenty of techniques for detecting anomalous events, research on anomaly classi cation and extraction (e. g., to further investigate what happened or to share evidence with third parties involved) is rather marginal. This makes it harder for network operators to analise reported anomalies because they depend solely on their experience to do the job. Furthermore, this task is an extremely time-consuming and error-prone process. The third block of this thesis targets this issue and brings it together with the knowledge acquired in the previous blocks. In particular, it presents a system for automatic anomaly detection, extraction and classi cation with high accuracy and very low false positives. We deploy the system in an operational environment and show its usefulness in practice. The fourth and last block of this thesis presents a generalisation of our system that focuses on analysing all the tra c, not only network anomalies. This new system seeks to further help network operators by summarising the most signi cant tra c patterns in their network. In particular, we generalise our system to deal with big network tra c data. In particular, it deals with src/dst IPs, src/dst ports, protocol, src/dst Autonomous Systems, layer 7 application and src/dst geolocation. We rst deploy a prototype in the <b>European</b> <b>backbone</b> network of G EANT and show that it can process large amounts of data quickly and build highly informative and compact reports that are very useful to help comprehending what is happening in the network. Second, we deploy it in a completely di erent scenario and show how it can also be successfully used in a real-world use case where we analyse the behaviour of highly distributed devices related with a critical infrastructure sector.

En primer lloc, hi ha una clara manca d'informaci o detallada i actualitzada sobre les anomalies m es comuns i les seves caracter stiques. En segona inst ancia, no tenir en compte la possibilitat de treballar amb nom es part de les dades (mostreig de tr ansit) continua sent bastant est es tot i el sever efecte en el rendiment dels algorismes de detecci o d'anomalies. En tercer lloc, els operadors de xarxa actualment han d'invertir moltes hores de feina per classi car i inspeccionar manualment les anomalies detectades per actuar en conseqüencia i prendre les mesures apropiades de mitigaci o. Aquesta situaci o es veu agreujada per l'alt nombre de falsos positius i falsos negatius i perqu e els sistemes de detecci o d'anomalies s on sovint percebuts com caixes negres extremadament complexes. Analitzar un tema es essencial per comprendre plenament l'espai del problema i per poder-hi fer front de forma adequada. Per tant, el primer bloc d'aquesta tesi pret en proporcionar informaci o detallada i actualitzada del m on real sobre les anomalies m es freqüents en una xarxa troncal. Primer es comparen tres eines comercials per a la detecci o d'anomalies i se n'estudien els seus punts forts i febles, aix com els tipus d'anomalies de xarxa detectats. Posteriorment, s'investiguen les caracter stiques de les anomalies que es troben en la mateixa xarxa troncal utilitzant una de les eines durant m es de mig any. Entre d'altres resultats, aquest bloc con rma la necessitat de l'aplicaci o de mostreig de tr ansit en un entorn operacional, aix com el nombre inacceptablement elevat de falsos positius i falsos negatius en eines comercials actuals. En general, el mostreig de tr ansit de dades de xarxa (es a dir, treballar nom es amb una part de les dades) en grans xarxes troncals s'ha convertit en gaireb e obligatori i, per tant, tots els algorismes de detecci o d'anomalies que no ho tenen en compte poden veure seriosament afectats els seus resultats. El segon bloc d'aquesta tesi analitza i confi rma el dram atic impacte de mostreig en el rendiment de t ecniques de detecci o d'anomalies plenament acceptades a l'estat de l'art. No obstant, es mostra que els resultats canvien signi cativament depenent de la t ecnica de mostreig utilitzada i tamb e en funci o de la m etrica usada per a fer la comparativa. Contr ariament als resultats reportats en estudis previs, es mostra que Packet Sampling supera Flow Sampling. A m es, a m es, s'observa que Selective Sampling (SES), una t ecnica de mostreig que se centra en mostrejar fluxes petits, obt e resultats molt millors per a la detecci o d'escanejos que no pas les t ecniques tradicionals de mostreig. En conseqü encia, proposem Online Selective Sampling, una t ecnica de mostreig que obt e el mateix bon rendiment per a la detecci o d'escanejos que SES, per o treballa paquet per paquet enlloc de mantenir tots els fluxes a mem oria. Despr es de validar i evaluar la nostra proposta, demostrem que es capa c de treballar online i utilitza molts menys recursos que SES. Tot i la gran quantitat de tècniques proposades a la literatura per a la detecci o d'esdeveniments an omals, la investigaci o per a la seva posterior classi caci o i extracci o (p. ex., per investigar m es a fons el que va passar o per compartir l'evid encia amb tercers involucrats) es m es aviat marginal. Aix o fa que sigui m es dif cil per als operadors de xarxa analalitzar les anomalies reportades, ja que depenen unicament de la seva experi encia per fer la feina. A m es a m es, aquesta tasca es un proc es extremadament lent i propens a errors. El tercer bloc d'aquesta tesi se centra en aquest tema tenint tamb e en compte els coneixements adquirits en els blocs anteriors. Concretament, presentem un sistema per a la detecci o extracci o i classi caci o autom atica d'anomalies amb una alta precisi o i molt pocs falsos positius. Adicionalment, despleguem el sistema en un entorn operatiu i demostrem la seva utilitat pr actica. El quart i ultim bloc d'aquesta tesi presenta una generalitzaci o del nostre sistema que se centra en l'an alisi de tot el tr ansit, no nom es en les anomalies. Aquest nou sistema pret en ajudar m es als operadors ja que resumeix els patrons de tr ansit m es importants de la seva xarxa. En particular, es generalitza el sistema per fer front al "big data" (una gran quantitat de dades). En particular, el sistema tracta IPs origen i dest i, ports origen i destí, protocol, Sistemes Aut onoms origen i dest, aplicaci o que ha generat el tr ansit i fi nalment, dades de geolocalitzaci o (tamb e per origen i dest). Primer, despleguem un prototip a la xarxa europea per a la recerca i la investigaci o (G EANT) i demostrem que el sistema pot processar grans quantitats de dades r apidament aix com crear informes altament informatius i compactes que s on de gran utilitat per ajudar a comprendre el que est a succeint a la xarxa. En segon lloc, despleguem la nostra eina en un escenari completament diferent i mostrem com tamb e pot ser utilitzat amb exit en un cas d' us en el m on real en el qual s'analitza el comportament de dispositius altament distribuïts.
