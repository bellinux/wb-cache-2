His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> official structures and the king.|$|E

5|$|The Kirtlandian is a North American land-vertebrate faunal {{age of the}} Cretaceous period, {{following}} the Judithian and succeeded by the Edmontonian. It lasted about 2 million years, ca 74.8 to 72.8 Mya and {{is characterized by the}} ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii, which lived throughout the Kirtlandian. It was first named by R.M. Sullivan and S.G. Lucas in 2003 as a faunal age for the Kirtland and Fruitland formations. Previously, only five land-vertebrate ages were identified from the Late Cretaceous. as identified by Loris S. Russell in 1975, they include the Paluxian, Aquilan, Judithian, Edmontonian, and the Lancian. Before the naming of the Kirtlandian, three <b>gaps,</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Paluxian and Aquilan, the Aquilan and the Judithian, and the Judithian and Edmontonian, were identified but not named.|$|E
5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society.

Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

5|$|The town's heyday as a {{seaside resort}} {{was during the}} late Victorian era; the {{population}} nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901. Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion {{was added to the}} landward end of the pier. By 1931, the town's population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of World War II, the army cut two <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure.

5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E

5|$|Just {{days before}} his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern {{sections}} of the 38th parallel by stretching the South Korean forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast. Following his instructions, the ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while the ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, the ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division {{in the aftermath of}} the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between the ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of the US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> understrength South Korean units. Because the South Korean forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four South Korean divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the North Korean forces had been probing the South Korean lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, the KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on the ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front.|$|E
5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for polonium {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope. The electron of the hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E
