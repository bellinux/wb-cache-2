Thirteen patients with <b>gynecologic</b> <b>malignancies</b> were asked, before treatment, to collect serial urine samples voided within 24 hours. Nine of these 13 patients were also asked to save early morning urine for 2 – 3 consecutive days. Their urine was assayed for creatinine and hCG-βC using an immunoradiometric assay. Variation of urine concentration was corrected by using the hCG-βC/creatinine (βC/Cr) ratio expressed in pmolg− 1. Wide fluctuations of βC/Cr ratios were found both in the serial spot urine within 24 hours and in early morning urine within 3 days. Eight per cent of the patients had one or more spot hCG-βC level double or half the median of their own serial urine samples. Neither spot urine nor early morning urine hCG-βC were suitable for use as a tumor marker for continuous monitoring because of the large fluctuation in hCG-βC levels.

40|$|Abstract Background Ovarian {{cancer has}} the highest {{mortality}} rate of all <b>gynecologic</b> <b>malignancy.</b> <b>The</b> receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EGFR, ERBB 2, PDGFR, VEGFR and MET, are activated in subsets of ovarian cancer, suggesting that these kinases might represent novel therapeutic targets. However, clinical trials have not or just partially shown benefit to ovarian cancers treated with EGFR, ERBB 2, or PDGFR inhibitors. Despite multiple RTK activation in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, {{it is unclear whether}} transforming activity is dependent on an individual kinase oncoprotein or the coordinated activity of multiple kinases. We hypothesized that a coordinated network of multi-RTK activation is important for the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancers. Results Herein, we demonstrate co-activation of multiple RTKs (EGFR, ERBB 2, ERBB 4, MET and/or AXL) in individual ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We also show that coordinate inhibition of this multi-kinase signaling has substantially greater effect on ovarian cancer proliferation and survival, compared to inhibition of individual activated kinases. The inhibition of this multi-RTK signaling by HSP 90 suppression results in profound pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects, and is associated with the inactivation of RTK downstream PI 3 -K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MAPK signaling. Conclusion These studies suggest that anti-multiple RTK strategy could be useful in the treatment of ovarian cancer. </p...|$|R
