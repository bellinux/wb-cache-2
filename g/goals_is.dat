5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: neural correlate). Several groups are inspired by these advances.|$|E
5|$|Another {{character}} commonly {{described as}} an archenemy is Venom. Eddie Brock as Venom is commonly described as the mirror version or the evil version of Spider-Man in many ways. Venom's <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> usually depicted as trying to ruin Spider-Man's life and mess with Spider-Man's head {{when it comes to}} targeting enemies. Venom is cited as being {{one of the most popular}} Spider-Man villains. This popularity has led him to be an established iconic character of his own with own comic book stories.|$|E

5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> {{to map the}} Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> to protect, restore {{and create}} areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely}} to benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E

50|$|The term goal {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{structure}} in which <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> scored. The ice hockey <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> rectangular in shape; the front frame of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> made of steel tube painted red (or another color depending on the league) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar. A net {{is attached to the}} back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. The entire <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 72 in wide by 48 in tall, and the footprint of the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 44 in deep.|$|R

5000|$|Using a values {{approach}} to goal pursuit, Heath et al. (1999) assert that proximal <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} result in successful outcomes. [...] When a <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> proximal, value for each step of progress is greater than if the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> distal given diminishing sensitivity. One way to transform a distal goal to a more proximal <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to set subgoals. Therefore, Heath et al. (1999) assert that setting subgoals is an effective strategy to motivate successful goal pursuit.|$|R
500|$|The longer {{boundary}} {{lines are}} touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> placed) <b>are</b> <b>goal</b> lines.

The inner edges of the vertical <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the <b>goal</b> posts must <b>be</b> [...] above the ground.

25|$|A needs assessment, an {{analysis}} of corporate and individual <b>goals,</b> <b>is</b> often undertaken prior {{to the development of}} a training program. In addition, a careful needs analysis is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained. A training needs analysis typically involves a three-step process that includes organizational analysis, task analysis and person analysis.|$|E
25|$|MDG proponents such as McArthur and Sachs {{countered that}} setting <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> still valid despite {{measurement}} difficulties, as {{they provide a}} political and operational framework to efforts.

They asserted that non-health related MDGs were often well measured, and that not all MDGs were made moot by lack of data.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{limitation}} is in digitizing the inputs for the VII system. VII systems will probably continue to sense existing signs and roadway markings {{but one of}} the <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> to eliminate such signs and markings altogether. This would require converting the locations and messages of each item into the VII system's format. Responsibility for this work would probably fall on the highway agencies which nearly all face difficulties in funding, manpower, and available time. Implementing and maintaining VII systems may therefore require support at the national level.|$|E

A multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> presented by Chai and Yang, where a deterministic state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang. A user action discovery model is presented by Yin et al., where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{immediate}} and obvious obstacle to realization of these <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that}} two historic Islamic structures which are 13 centuries old, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, are built on top of the Temple Mount. Israel has undertaken to ensure access to the Temple Mount for peaceful worshippers and visitors, while maintaining public order and security. Any efforts to damage or reduce access to these sites, or to build Jewish structures within, between, beneath, beside, cantilevered on top of, or instead of them, could lead to severe international conflicts, given the association of the Muslim world with these holy places.|$|E
25|$|Adolescents who misuse alcohol {{can benefit}} from {{interventions}} aimed at risk reduction. For more severe cases an intervention involving parents, guardians, and/or a psychotherapist is recommended. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to admission to hospital, e.g. for alcohol poisoning or injury, is manualised brief interventions at the hospital in one to four counseling sessions each lasting 30 to 60 minutes conducted by trained staff. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative short and long-term consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.|$|E
