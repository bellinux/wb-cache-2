I have suffered much lately but you again encourage me.|$|E

As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

5|$|Pam made a brief {{appearance}} in the 12th season premiere, with a different appearance {{as a result of}} plastic surgery (which also doubled as an explanation for Margaret Michaels playing the role, rather than Victoria Principal). She tells her brother Cliff that she is <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> her new life and plans to marry her doctor. Later, after Cliff leaves, her doctor asks why she didn't tell Cliff that she has a terminal disease and only has a year to live. This was the character's final {{appearance in}} the series, although Pam was not immediately declared dead on the show.|$|E
5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming <b>happy.</b> <b>In</b> September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E
5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner {{spent much of the}} day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role in}} selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E

30|$|Layard {{writes about}} 'rampant individualism', but {{research}} shows people are <b>happier</b> <b>in</b> individualistic society (Veenhoven 1999) {{and one of}} the probable reasons is that individualism enhances the chance that one leads a life that fits one's preferences and capacities. How about the modern time stress? Research shows that people tend to be <b>happier</b> <b>in</b> countries where the pace of life is high (Garhammer 2002) {{and one of the}} reasons seems to be that such societies appeal more to the human need for challenge.|$|R

25|$|Witticisms {{were found}} in McCord's writings; not airy wit, as might be {{expected}} from her French training, but Horatian satire. This was also her conversational style. McCord was a conservative. She advocated State sovereignty, favoring secession, and a political confederation founded upon a community of interests. Her vision was of a great Southern confederacy in which the culture of classical learning would continue to flourish, in which an economic independence would be maintained through the cotton industry, in which the Afro-American would be most comfortable and <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> a state of slavery, and in which the white master, with his labor question settled, would be furnished the leisure requisite for the pursuit of science and art.|$|E
25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} was <b>happy</b> <b>in</b> Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.|$|E
