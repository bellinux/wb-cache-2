5|$|In December 2012, Whedon {{stated that}} he had {{completed}} an outline for the film. In February, at the 2013 Jameson Dublin International Film Festival, Whedon said that death would play a theme in the sequel, and in March, he said that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II as inspirations.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{interest}} in Islamic art was sparked {{in his youth}} by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, mystical texts and astrological treatises. While at Harvard in the 1950s, he would make purchases in New York, and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and London. He would bid regularly at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> his friend Stuart Cary Welch, a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E

5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, Burge {{signed with}} National League South club Sutton United on a {{contract}} running until summer 2017. He contributed three goals in five games as the U's won promotion into the National League as champions of the Southern Division in 2015–16. He was forced to miss {{the rest of the}} season after his ankle ligaments were damaged from a heavy challenge he received during a 2–0 win at Wealdstone on 22 March. Burge made his National League debut in a 1–1 draw with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 9 August. On 9 December 2016, Burge was released by Sutton United as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> continue his career nearer to his Cheltenham home.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{joined the}} Canadian junior {{team for the}} 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, playing all seven games for the silver medal winning Canadians. He made his first {{appearance}} with the senior team following his rookie season in the NHL, playing six games in the 2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. His emergence in the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs earned him consideration for Canada's entry at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He {{was named to the}} team by executive director Wayne Gretzky as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> bring a younger team to this tournament than played at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The decision worked, as Regehr and the Canadians won the championship.|$|E

25|$|A {{scramble}} ensued, where Florian gave up {{his back}} twice {{but was unable to}} escape Penn's mount, the second time Penn took his opponent's back, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> trap Florian's arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a rear naked choke at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Ayeni and Wilson v. Layne, {{decided by}} the Supreme Court the year before, as precedents. In the latter case the Court had {{unanimously}} held it was unconstitutional for reporters to accompany federal marshals executing an arrest warrant in a private residence since their presence served no valid law enforcement purpose. Since the two cases involved private homes with a reasonable expectation of privacy, he distinguished Lauro's by noting the perp walk had occurred on a public street and {{sidewalk in front of}} the police station.|$|E
25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers to have trouble against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting {{had a tendency to}} rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> use his feet to come down the wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the off-side.|$|E

25|$|Iulian Dumitraș was Romania's main man. Dumitraș {{was known}} {{to be one of the}} Oaks' most gifted playmakers, with an {{accurate}} kicking boot and a penchant for sparking attacks. Having made his test debut in 2002, he went on to start in every match a Rugby World Cup 2007 in France, bringing plenty of experience to the nation. The then standing 1.88m and weighing in a 110kg, Dumitraș was a punishing runner when he chimes into the line on attack, which <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> do often, and he provided a solid and dependable last obstacle in defence.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{controversial}} nature of the loss, Rahman's ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by Oleg Maskaev in the eighth round of a fight <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting {{his head on the}} floor. Rahman dropped out of The Ring top 10 {{as a result of the}} surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion Oliver McCall and he assumed he was brought in as an easy win. Because of this, he did not train as hard as he should have and was beaten.|$|E
25|$|With William Adelin dead, Henry {{had only}} one other {{legitimate}} child, Matilda, but female rights of inheritance were unclear during this period. Despite Henry taking a second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, it became increasingly unlikely that Henry would have another legitimate son and instead <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> Matilda as his intended heir. Matilda had been married to Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, from which she later claimed the title of empress. Her husband died in 1125 and she was remarried in 1128 to Geoffrey V of Anjou, whose county bordered the Duchy of Normandy. Geoffrey was unpopular with the Anglo-Norman elite: as an Angevin ruler, he was a traditional enemy of the Normans. At the same time, tensions continued to grow {{as a result of}} Henry's domestic policies, in particular the high level of revenue he was raising to pay for his various wars. Conflict was curtailed, however, by the power of the king's personality and reputation.|$|E
