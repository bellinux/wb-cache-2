5|$|A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions but {{is subject to the}} Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> the same state at the same time. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards.

On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> the same world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting this assertion, Ishii has also {{said in an interview}} that Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
5|$|Democratisation {{still left}} open one {{important}} {{distinction between the}} former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government {{the same degree of}} powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, {{at the end of which}} the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> the same way for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> {{the same way they}} had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary in the final two rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed <b>in</b> <b>exactly</b> one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E
