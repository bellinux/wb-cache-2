25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer {{on one side}} and a bucking bar on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
500|$|The ingots {{are then}} heated in a soaking pit and <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> into slabs, billets, or blooms. Slabs are {{hot or cold}} rolled into sheet metal or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. [...] Blooms are hot or cold rolled into {{structural}} steel, such as I-beams and rails. [...] In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line, with ore coming in and finished steel products coming out. Sometimes after a steel's final rolling it is heat treated for strength, however this is relatively rare.|$|E

500|$|Colossus's {{movements}} were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux {{had been unable}} to move athletically due to the platform shoes he had to wear on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking [...] "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at various samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges on the character, which could be moved separately {{from the rest of the}} model to keep them always perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all vendors. His mask is animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics, which helped balance out the [...] "chinwag" [...] caused by Reynolds' acting coming through the bottom of the mask. Replacing Deadpool's head fully was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital instead warped each shot based on facial reference from Reynolds, and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes. This was called an [...] "ingenious 2D-ish solution".|$|E
