Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark.

50|$|The {{friendship}} {{paradox is}} the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine whether adolescents 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of the influences of romantic relationships on the features of same-sex friendships varied with age and sex, and to examine how adolescents 2 ̆ 7 adjustment is related to their conceptions of friendships when one member of the friendship has a romantic relationship. Ninth (n = 198) and eleventh graders (n = 152) completed a questionnaire about their conceptions of friendship features both when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship and when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Students also reported on the features of their best friendship and on their social, psychological, and academic adjustment. The results showed that conceptions of the impact of romantic relationships on friendship varied with age and sex. Ninth and eleventh graders viewed a friendship in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as having less frequent interactions and less self-esteem support and intimacy, but more conflict, rivalry, and disloyalty than a friendship in which neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Moreover, the effect of a romantic relationship on frequency of interaction was greater in the eleventh than the ninth grade. Eleventh graders also viewed friends as engaging in less co-rumination when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic partner, while ninth graders did not. Compared to boys, girls viewed friendships as lower in intimacy and co-rumination and higher in conflict and rivalry when one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship than when neither <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship. Adolescents who were better adjusted academically viewed friendships in which one <b>friend</b> <b>had</b> a romantic relationship as more supportive. Students who perceived themselves as more accepted by their peers had conceptions of such friendships as higher in intimacy. These results imply that with increasing age, romantic relationships have an increasingly negative impact on the closeness of friendships, compared to boys, girls 2 ̆ 7 friendships are more adversely influenced by a <b>friend</b> <b>having</b> a romantic relationship, and adolescents who expect friendships with a <b>friend</b> who <b>has</b> a romantic relationship to be characterized by greater support and intimacy and less conflict and rivalry show better adjustment. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{death of}} Nick Adams {{has been cited}} in {{articles}} and books about Hollywood's unsolved mysteries along with speculation by a few of Adams' acquaintances he was murdered (according to author David Kulczyk, Adams was apparently planning to write a tell-all book revealing many sexual secrets of Hollywood names) and claims no trace of paraldehyde (a liquid sedative often given to alcoholics {{at the time and}} one of two drugs attributed to his death) was ever found in his home. However, Adams' brother Andrew had become a medical doctor and prescribed the sedative to him. Moreover, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported stoppered bottles with prescription labels were found in the medicine cabinet near the upstairs bedroom where Adams' body was discovered. Through the years, Adams' children offered speculation ranging from murder to accidental death, the latter perhaps caused by Roeder while trying to calm the actor's nerves with an unintentionally lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs (although the autopsy found no alcohol in Adams' blood). Actor Robert Conrad, Adams' best <b>friend,</b> <b>has</b> consistently maintained the death was accidental.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship {{is more about}} sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer {{wants to be the}} star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best <b>friend,</b> <b>has</b> now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E

500|$|In 1564 Mercator {{published}} his map of Britain, {{a map of}} greatly improved accuracy which far surpassed any of his previous representations. The circumstances were unusual.

Mercator's reticence shows that he was clearly aware of the political nature of the pro-Catholic map which showed all the Catholic religious foundations and omitted those created by Protestant Henry VIII; moreover it was engraved with text demeaning the history of England and praising that of Catholic Ireland and Scotland. It was invaluable as an accurate guide for the planned Catholic invasion of England by Phillip II of Spain.|$|E
