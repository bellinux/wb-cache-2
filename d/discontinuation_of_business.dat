This included the launch of a subsidiary, Financial Technologies International, to market and license computer software to financial institutions, the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> and real estate lending and the sale of its commercial, industrial and real estate portfolios valued at $275 million. In 1986, U.S. Trust was ranked behind trust competitors in assets under management and trust income. [...] In 1987 it dropped the account minimum from $1-2 million in liquid assets to $250,000. [...] U.S. Trust expanded its geographic presence throughout the 1990s by opening new offices and acquiring others across the continental United States.|$|E
30|$|The <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{signifies the}} point at which {{entrepreneurs}} find it hard and impossible to continue their business ventures. Some circumstances arise which negatively affect businesses. It could either be due to natural disaster or circumstances beyond the entrepreneur’s control, which in law, is described as the act of God. It could also be as a result of poor management practices, unavailability of resources, changes in consumers’ preferences, or change of policies. However, entrepreneurs, who are very resilient and optimistic, decide to start all over again. This signifies the loop-back from the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> to the potential entrepreneur level where new ideas are nursed. It stands for entrepreneurs who were once knocked out of the process, but came back on board.|$|E

40|$|Magister Artium - MAAs {{the title}} indicates, this {{research}} {{is concerned about the}} displacement and resettlement situation in Arada sub-city, Addis Ababa. The City Administration is implementing an urban redevelopment program to improve the poor infrastructural facilities, service provision,sewerage, sanitation, housing quality and supply. The implementation of these projects displaces households from their residential area exposing them to various impoverishment risks. The Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction Model (Cernea, 2000), which is a tool used for managing risk identification, prevention and mitigation, stipulates displaced people could encounter {{one or more of the}} eight potential risks of landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, social disarticulation, marginalization, increased morbidity and mortality, food insecurity and loss of access to common property resources. Thus many development practitioners advocate the importance of democratization of the displacement and resettlement processes to reduce potential risks. The purpose of the research is to investigate how the displacement and resettlement process has been undertaken and to describe the impoverishment risks displaced households faced. This will contribute to the improvement of the program and other similar programs in the future as it is implemented with short, medium and long term plans. Thus it will indicate more constructive ways of implementing the displacement process that reduces risks by informing concerned agencies of more sustainable ways to configure and implement their work. Academically, the research will test the feasibility of the risk variables described by the IRR model to an inner area of urban context. Therefore, the research will answer the following questions: What impoverishment risks do the households face due to displacement and resettlement to the temporary and condominium houses? What coping mechanisms do households employ to adapt to the new circumstances? Was there access to information? Was the displacement and resettlement process participatory? The research noted that the displaced residents are exposed to impoverishment risks of homelessness, marginalization, lack of services, health hazard and economic impacts. The construction of the Condo house is of a much better standard than the temporary shelters. As a result the transfer of households to the Condo house has relieved them from the risks they had faced at the temporary shelter. However, the design of the Condo building, omission of basic facilities like a customary kitchen and the adopted communal neighborhood regulations imposes new type of risks such as the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>business</b> and unsuitability to daily and cultural practices. The <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>business</b> both at the temporary shelter and later at the Condo house severely affected household income generation potential of poor households. These households are afraid that they may end up homeless as they are unable to pay the much more expensive house rental fee. The research concludes the impoverishment risks that displaced households faced could be mitigated by making the displacement and resettlement process participatory, transparent and by coordinating the activities of the implementing agencies. Moreover, this can be achieved by curbing the “demolish and relocate” approach used in the displacement and resettlement process to “relocate and demolish”. This will help to avoid housing the displaced in temporary shelters and associated governance shortcomings from the process which occurred due to the “demolish and relocate” approach...|$|R

40|$|Small-sized food {{processing}} enterprises are {{a vital part}} of the manufacturing sector of Bulgaria. From their startup, all through the transition period and financial crises, until today, these enterprises have originated, grown, and struggled through many challenges. The purpose of the study is to identify, describe, and analyze the growth challenges and their impact on small-sized enterprises in {{food processing}} that have opened and are operating in Bulgaria. Two cases of small, family-run, microenterprizes, from the food processing subsector enterprises, located in the Severoiztochen (North-Eastern) region of Bulgaria were selected for a comparative case study. The biggest challenge for the growth of a small enterprise is the integration of many responsibilities. In small food processing companies, they do not have a different workforce for marketing, operations management, human resources, financial management, and networking. It is done by the same people who started it. The need for finding a proper balance and playing many roles at once makes it very difficult. This requires constant learning, insight, and flexibility. The difficulties cannot be categorized as ‘more or less critical’. Rather they can be grouped into two subcategories: ‘potentially manageable’ and ‘potentially unmanageable’. Growth challenges are correlated and will be considered in their complexities. Case companies are impacted by challenges, both positive and negative. The positive takeaway is that they have been valuable vehicles of managerial learning along the pathway to growth; and the negative is that they have contributed seriously to stalling the rate of growth. Small-sized food processing enterprises, to a large extent, replicate the patterns in other sectors. However, some growth challenges they face are unique; such as those related to food safety. Failure to provide safe food products could translate into <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is a clear}} {{difference}} of opinion amongst researchers on the interrelatedness of the variables trust, commitment, satisfaction, coordination, cooperation and continuity in a business-to-business (B 2 B) environment. The reason is that in previous studies much emphasis {{has been placed on}} creating and testing new theories, and not on providing practical generalities. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how the variable satisfaction is positioned in relation to trust and commitment, and how satisfaction relates to the variables coordination, cooperation and continuity in a South African B 2 B environment. Setting: This study replicates a similar study conducted in 2013 in a B 2 B environment in South Africa and hopes to validate the outcome of that study by determining the relationship between the constructs postulated in the current study. The relationships between the different constructs in the proposed model will, therefore, provide a longitudinal perspective which is unique in terms of B 2 B research in South Africa. Methods: Both the original and replication studies followed a quantitative approach and targeted large companies in South Africa. In the original study, data were collected from 500 large South African companies, while in the replication study data were collected from 250 large companies. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. Results: The findings specifically point to the need for organisations to direct resources towards the establishment of relationships that are founded on trust and commitment. Doing so will help ensure increased satisfaction, which, in turn, will result in greater coordination and cooperation in B 2 B relationships as well as long-term continuation of the relationship. Conclusion: The foundation for strong B 2 B relationships is to secure customer satisfaction. Business managers ought to understand that when business customers are dissatisfied, it can result in the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> relationship...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} long term {{tolerance}} of parenteral gold and subsequent drug treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including prediction of outcome and 'survival' of sequential treatments. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 376 patients was made, including a detailed screening of 237 patients treated in 1989. Reasons for discontinuing treatment were analysed in life table analyses, which were used to compare patients receiving parenteral gold treatment in 1985 and 1989, and two groups of patients receiving disease modifying antirheumatic drugs after parenteral gold treatment. The causes <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> were followed in sequential treatments. RESULTS: The estimated probability <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> parenteral gold treatment was 29 % after six months and 42 %, 55 %, 74 %, and 92 % after 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Mucocutaneous side effects were the main cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> parenteral gold treatment {{during the first three}} years, while the probability <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> because <b>of</b> inefficacy dominated after four years. Side effects also constituted the main cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> treatments given after parenteral gold treatment during {{the first three years of}} follow up. No significant differences were found when comparing the termination rates between the first and the second and subsequent treatments after parenteral gold treatment. The main reasons for discontinuing one treatment could not predict the cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> the next treatment. CONCLUSION: Mucocutaneous side effects dominated initially, while inefficacy was the dominating cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> long term parenteral gold treatment. No serious side effects were registered. The cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> one treatment did not predict the cause <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> the following drug. Drug 'survival' was the same in both treatments after parenteral gold treatment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Psychiatric {{hospitalization}} {{can increase}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> pharmacotherapy, which may negatively influence patients' health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between psychiatric hospitalization and <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> somatic medication. METHODS: A retrospective crossover study was performed in patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital (index date), who had got somatic medication dispensed during the 3 months prior to hospitalization. <b>Discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> somatic medication was investigated at the following time points: index date and 3, 6, and 9 months before the index date. Relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) of discontinuing somatic medication at the index date versus the time points before the index date were estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: In all, 471 hospitalized patients {{were included in the}} study; 38. 9 % of the patients were discontinuers on the index date. RR for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> ≥ 1 somatic medication was 1. 88 (95 % CI= 1. 55 - 2. 27) at the index date compared with the other time points and highest for patients< 45 years (RR= 2. 83; 95 % CI= 1. 92 - 4. 18). CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric hospitalization was associated with an almost doubled risk <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> somatic medication.

40|$|Clinical and {{laboratory}} factors influencing the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> second-line antirheumatic drugs were prospectively studied using survival analysis in a consecutive series of 245 patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. A statistically significant influence of age, sex, serum IgA and HLA-DR 3 on the <b>discontinuation</b> rate <b>of</b> chrysotherapy because of toxicity was observed. The <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> sulfasalazine was increased by advanced age and high rank order of prescription. With respect to efficacy, high initial disease activity appeared to predispose to treatment termination of hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and penicillamine. Furthermore, an {{influence of the}} rank order <b>of</b> prescription on <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> sulfasalazine therapy {{because of lack of}} efficacy was found. Of interest is that <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> hydroxychloroquine therapy because of lack of efficacy occurred less frequently in HLA-DR 3 -positive than in HLA-DR 3 -negative patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the incidence and determinants for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> initial {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). DESIGN: In this retrospective follow-up study from hospital files and pharmacy dispensing data, a standard dataset was collected including patient characteristics, therapy characteristics, and HIV-monitoring parameters (e. g., CD 4 + lymphocyte counts, viral load determinations). Kaplan-Meier {{estimates of the}} cumulative probability <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> initial HAART were calculated. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify determinants for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> initial HAART. PATIENTS: All patients starting HAART (n = 99) during June 1996 to February 1997 at our regional AIDS center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and determinants for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> HAART. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up of 450 +/- 10 days, 27 patients switched initial HAART, 3 patients stopped any antiretroviral therapy. Reasons for switching were increasing viral load (18 x), insufficient decrease of viral load (3 x), and adverse events (6 x). Nonnaivete for antiretroviral therapy and a lower CD 4 + lymphocyte count at start were identified as determinants for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> initial HAART. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence density for <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> initial HAART was 25 per 100 patients/year. The main reason for switching was an increasing viral load.

40|$|Background: Trends of {{prevalence}} contraceptive {{rates is}} increasing {{in the last}} few years. However, the <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives prevalence is still stagnant. Goals: To obtain factors influencing <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives in couples of childbearing age 10 – 49 years. Methods: Population this research are women of childbearing age 10 – 49 years who are married. Sample in this research are all couples of childbearing age of 10 – 49 years who had ever used contraception and using contraception. The data was analysed using statistic test of logistic regression multivariate use SPSS version 15 nd STATA version 10. The analysed used primary sampling unit and weight to adjust based on survey design. Result: Proportion <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives in women of childbearing age 10 – 49 years is 32 %. In comparison between regions, the highest prevalence <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives is on outer Jawa Bali II (33. 6 %) than outer Jawa Bali I (32. 9 %) and Jawa Bali (30. 5 %). The most frequent reason <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives are do not need contraceptives (31 %), want to have child (26 %), fear of side effects (14 %) and do not want anymore (10 %). Based on the multivariate analysis show odds ratio <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives is twice as higher among married women age above 35 years compare to the younger group (OR adjusted 2. 150; 95 % CI = 2. 041 – 2. 265). The odds ratio <b>of</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives is also higher among couples who have less children (0 - 1 child) compare to those who has 3 or more children (OR adjusted 1. 486; 95 % CI = 1. 373 – 1. 568).
