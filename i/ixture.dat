The effect of varying j et Reynolds number and O 2 concentration on temperature and key species OH and CH 2 O was analysed. Temperature {{was measured using}} polarised/ depolarised (P/D) Rayleigh scattering and the OH/ CH 2 O species using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF), collec ted simultaneously. ‘Traditional Rayleigh’ requires a constant Rayleigh cross - section throughout the combustion process, which is impossible in high temperature oxy - fuel flames due to thermal decomposition leading to inaccuracy. However, a carefully - chosen combination of fuel and oxidiser can be exploited so the relative signal difference of P/D can be utilised. M <b>ixture</b> fraction can thereby be determined and temperature accurately recovered. This joint measurement enables combustion evolution in preheat (re presented by CH 2 O) and oxidation (represented by OH) zones to be analysed.

40|$|With a {{decrease}} of classic pollution of water ecosystems the importance of PPCP (pharmaceutics and personal care products) increases. Their amount is increasing due to human consumption and thus the input into municipal wastewater and consequently into the surface water, eventually into the ground water increases as well. This bachelor work is a review of scientific literature {{in the field of}} PPCP water load. The goal is resuming the results of the studies of the influence of these substances on freshwater aquatic communities. In the beginning the sources of the variability (in time and space) of the concentrations of these substances in rivers are resumed. But the rate of affection of the aquatic communities depends even on the length of exposure, which is longterm with regard to the continuous flow of substances from wastewater treatment plants. That is why the effect of long-term incidence on aquatic communities is intensively studied. The emphasis is put on the incidence of endocrine disruptors (substances disrupting the endocrine system), which affect e. g. the oestral cycle of some kind of exposed populations. There are observed changes in the way of perception of a predator by his prey whereas the escape reactions of the prey happen to be affected. The additive effect of <b>ixtures</b> of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We report {{classical}} atomistic {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of four structurally diverse model asphaltenes, a model resin, {{and their respective}} mixtures in toluene or heptane at ambient conditions. Relatively large systems (~ 50, 000 atoms) and long timescales (> 80 ns) are explored. Where ever possible, comparisons are made to available experimental observations asserting {{the validity of the}} models. W hen the asphaltenes are dissolved in toluene, a continuous distribut ion of cluster sizes is observed with average aggregation number ranging between 3. 6 and 5. 6, monomers and dimers being the predominant species. As expected for mixtures in heptane the asphaltene molecules tend to aggregate to form a segregated phase. There is no evidence of a distinct formation of nanoaggregates, the distributions of clusters is found to be continuous in character. The analysis of the shape of the clusters of asphaltenes suggests that they are generally spherical in character, with the archipelago models favouring longer prolate structures and the continental model tending towards oblate structures. The aggregates are seen to be diffuse in nature, containing at least 50 % solvent on average, being denser in heptane than in toluene. M <b>ixtures</b> of asphaltenes with different architecture are found to have cluster properties that are intermediate between those of the individual components. The presence of resins in the mixture does not appear to a lter the shape of the asphaltene aggregate s, their size or density when toluene is the solvent; on the other hand the resins lead to an increase in the density of the resulting aggregates in heptane. Quantification of these observations is made from the hi stograms of cluster distributions, the p otential of mean force calculations, and an analysis of the shape factors. We illustrate how the time scales for complete aggregation of molecules in heptane are larger than the longest of the simulations reported in the open literature and as an example report a long simulation (0. 5 μs) which fails to reach an equilibrium state, suggesting that acceleration techniques, for example, using coarse grained models, are needed to appropriately explore these phenomena...|$|R

Samples o f different strains, or isolates, of the compound under stud y are used, typically with some replication.

For some simple time trend models, fittin g using a generalized estimating equation approach leads to a surpri singly simple modification of the multinomial fit and casts li ght on the behaviour in more complex models.

40|$|The axial {{resistivity}} {{profiles of}} the silicon crystals were quite level. It appears then that he evapora-tion of arsenic atoms from the liquid is nearly in equilibrium {{with the number of}} atoms rejected by the freezing solid. Figure 4 shows some typical plots of resistivity vs. the percentage crystal pulled for crystals grown by the vapor-phase technique and doped with arsenic trichloride. A few experiments using higher arsenic tri-chloride-supply rates and longer buildup periods of arsenic in the melt, produced crystals with re-sistivities not lower than 0. 0009 ohm-cm. It appears that saturation of arsenic in the melt occurs after 45 - 60 min, limiting the carrier concentration of arsenic in the crystal to a maximum value of 3 x 101 ~ atoms/cm'. Summary Arsenic-doped, melt-grown silicon crystals with level resistivity profiles, ranging from 1 x 104 to 5 x 10 - ~ ohm-cm, were obtained by passing an arsenic trichloride-helium <b>ixture</b> into a silicon crystal grower. The desired resistivity could be obtained by varying the arsenic trichloride supply rate and/or by varying the arsenic buildup period in the melt. Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank J. M.

The present study was aimed to study the analgesic effect of Persian Gulf Conus textile and its comparison with morphine in mouse model.

40|$|Soot {{production}} in gas turbine combustors is not desirable {{since it is}} the major source of exhaust smoke emission and its thermal radiation to the combustor liner deteriorates the liner durability. Soot formation involves comparatively slow chemistry and equilibrium can not be applied to soot modelling in the combustor flow field.. The exact sooting process in the combustor is poorly understood given both the complexity and the limited experimental data available. The work reported in this thesis seeks to first develop in-situ techniques for retrieving spatially-resolved soot properties, mainly soot particle volume fraction, from within the combustor and also to apply the measured results to comparisons with predicted soot concentrations. Two probing methods have been demonstrated which also incorporate a laser absorption technique. The sight probe proves to be more reliable in the present measurements. The evaluation of the physical probing techniques in sooty laboratory flames reveals that the flame structure will not be substantially distorted by the probe. The disturbance caused by the probe is localised, a feature which is evident in the reported water flow visualization test. The necessary inert gas purge can be minimised to reduce the local aerodynamic perturbation. The measured soot volume fraction distributions are comparable with sooting levels reported in flame studies in the literature. The peak soot volume fractions are located off-axis, characteristic of the fuel atornization. The measurementsin the primary zone are restricted by the multi-phase character of the flow, where soot absorption can not be readily discriminated from fuel droplet scattering. Measurements are reported over a range of air-fuel ratios, inlet pressures and temperatures.
