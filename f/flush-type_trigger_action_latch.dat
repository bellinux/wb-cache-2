30|$|Thus, CSS use {{context to}} direct actions and {{behaviors}} to support communication between systems and their users (Vieira et al. 2011). To provide this support {{can be used}} (Chalmers 2002): Contextual sensing, Contextual augmentation, Contextual resource discovery, Context <b>triggered</b> <b>actions,</b> and Contextual mediation. In our work, we {{are concerned with the}} last two cases Context <b>triggered</b> <b>actions</b> and Contextual mediation. They are two types of Contextual adaptation (Chalmers 2002) that are responsible for changing the sequence of actions, the style of interactions and the type of information provided to users in order to adapt to the user’s current needs or requirements failure (Vieira et al. 2011).|$|R

50|$|In network management, systems management, {{application}} management and service management, people usually refer instead to event correlation. As CEP engines, event correlation engines (event correlators) analyze {{a mass of}} events, pinpoint the most significant ones, and <b>trigger</b> <b>actions.</b> However, {{most of them do}} not produce new inferred events. Instead, they relate high-level events with low-level events.|$|R
