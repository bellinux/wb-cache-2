40|$|Introduction. Experimental {{research}} activity has recently {{focused on a}} promising new method for low-energy defibrillation. Called far-field defibrillation, the method imposes electric field pulses that engage {{the bulk of the}} heart tissue, in contrast to other methods that deliver electrical energy locally through implanted electrodes. The effectiveness of this method can potentially depend on the timing of the delivery of the pulses. Here we describe a new mechanism by which these electric field pulses might terminate reentrant waves that operates independently of shock timing. Methods. A three-dimensional finite-difference inonodomain computer simulation, which includes a full ion channel model and resistive gap junction coupling, is run in rectangular domains of different widths, designed to represent heart walls of varying thicknesses. Once a reentrant action potential scroll wave is established in the system, an electric field stimulus is delivered with varying field vector orientations through the imposition of its effect on the domain boundary conditions. Results. We find that, once the surface perpendicular to the scroll wave filament is depolarized by the electric <b>field,</b> <b>termination</b> of the scroll wave always results. Termination is nearly immediate in the case of thin walls (0. 5 cm). In thicker walls (e. g., 2. 0 cm), interaction of the induced wave with the scroll wave results in an L-shaped filament, which then shrinks and disappears by the same mechanism by which scroll wave rings terminate. Termination thus occurs independently of wall thickness, timing, and electric field orientation, as long as the latter has a normal component sufficient (about 1 V/cm) to elicit a wave. This new mechanism will likely operate alongside other mechanisms, and thus has the potential to lower the defibrillation threshold...|$|E
40|$|Chrysoptharta agricola (Chapuis) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Paropsini) spends 6 − 7 {{months of}} its {{lifecycle}} {{as an adult}} in reproductive diapause sheltering in leaf litter. Beetles emerge in October - November to feed, mate and oviposit. We {{examined the effects of}} photoperiod and temperature on the induction and termination of reproductive diapause in the laboratory, and conducted field studies to validate results. Although usually univoltine, new adults may oviposit in summer before overwintering, with bivoltine years resulting in significantly more plantation damage. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that a critical photoperiod over 12 and under 16 hours of light was required to initiate diapause, although at 16 hours light 55 % of beetles entered diapause in response to low temperature (9 C) alone. High temperature subverted diapause in about 20 % of adults at short photoperiods. Field observations and dissections of field-collected females indicated that the critical photoperiod is around 14 hours 40 minutes of daylight: adults emerging after this period entered diapause without producing eggs. Voltinism in C. agricola is thus a seasonally plastic trait that is dependent on emergence time of teneral adults. There was no difference in the length of time that males and females took to enter diapause in laboratory experiments, or in the <b>field.</b> <b>Termination</b> of diapause was primarily influenced by temperature, although photoperiod had an effect at low temperatures. The threshold temperature for time to initiate feeding was calculated as 5. 4 C (83. 6 DD), while the threshold for oviposition was 7. 4 C (82. 2 DD after feeding).

In addition to providing excellent structural images, the dense sampling of 2 D and 3 D survey can sometimes make it possible to map reservoir quality and the distribution of hydrocarbon with well-marked limitations. Here we use 2 D and 3 D seismic data to map and interpret basic structures and fault lines to construct 2 D and 3 D base fault models of the Gullfaks field, while avoiding common pitfalls. This work also highlights important concepts and principles that allow selection, interpretation and simulation of particular areas containing hydrocarbon traps through the comparison of different maps such as time structure, amplitude and coherence. The field covers an area of approximately 50  km 2 entirely confined within block 34 / 10 in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The area of the seismic lines extends to 4875  m laterally and vertically up to 4.5  s. Based on all the selected horizons, constructed maps and dominant fault construction models (2 D and 3 D), we show the presence of a major fault that cuts five horizons of the area of interest. The structural features include antiform and a set of extensional faults with master, antithetic and synthetic faults with opposite sense of shear (dip direction and angle ~ 60 °). Ductile deformation at the bottom of seismic lines shows the fluctuation of amplitude of acoustic signals in seismic lines. Our results demonstrate uplift along the major fault during extension indicated by chaotic distortion at the bottom, which reveals a gas trap. In the Gullfaks <b>field,</b> <b>termination</b> of fault movement and subsequent deformation appears to have occurred for a long period of time.

40|$|Abstract. Termination {{analysis}} tools strive to find proofs of termination for as wide {{a class of}} (terminating) programs as possible. Though several tools exist which are able to prove termination of non-trivial programs, when one tries to apply them to realistic programs, {{there are still a}} number of open problems. In the case of Java-like languages, one of such problems is to find a practical solution to prove termination when the termination behaviour of loops is affected by numeric fields. We have performed statistics on the Java libraries to see how often this happens in practice and we found that in 12. 95 % of cases, the number of iterations of loops (and therefore termination) explicitly depends on values stored in fields and, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, such fields are numeric. Inspired by the examples found in the libraries, this paper identifies a series of difficulties that need to be solved in order to deal with numeric <b>fields</b> in <b>termination</b> and propose some ideas towards a lightweight analysis which is able to prove termination of sequential Java-like program...|$|R

The retinal projection areas in adult-operated animals were not {{different from those of}} unoperated controls, but aberrant pathways were found in the infant group. Following removal of striate cortex there was a small aberrant pathway to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP) and possibly to the pretectum. After removal of the superior colliculus there was a conspicuous aberrant projection to LP, which was even more prominent after combined removal of striate cortex and superior colliculus. The results support the proposal that when the normal <b>field</b> of <b>termination</b> is damaged, either directly by a tectal lesion or indirectly by a cortical lesion, axons grow and innervate LP, which has been partly deafferented by the lesion and which consequently possesses vacant synaptic space. Although the different consequences of early and late lesions may indicate that only infantile damaged terminals can redistribute themselves an alternative is that in infants many axons have not yet reached their normal terminal sites at the time of operation and that only those axons have the ability to continue growing and to form an aberrant pathways.

40|$|The compartmental {{organization}} of corticostriatal projections from the fronto-orbito-insular cortex was {{studied in the}} cat. Cortical areas in this field {{were found to have}} a highly organized projection to the striatum, selectively innervating striosomes dorsally and predominantly avoiding them ventrally within their striatal <b>fields</b> of <b>termination.</b> These observations have two important implications for striatal processing. First, some cortical areas preferentially terminate in different compartments {{in different parts of the}} striatum. Therefore, the sources of input to striosomes and matrix are not categorical but switch according to the striatal region considered. Second, three properties of the bicompartmental termination pattern [...] one-dimensionality, common polarization, and multiple positions at which the pattern switched from "fills" to "avoids" [...] allowed us to order the corticostriatal projections with respect to one another. This ordering of the striatal projections of cortical areas implies an ordering of the cortical areas themselves, one that is independent of transcortical connections. For the corticostriatal projections described in this report, the ordering is [parietal, dorsomedial prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, insular, rostral temporal] cortex. Our analysis suggests that a major function of striatal compartmentalization is to segregate and then bring together inputs from cortical areas at different positions in this ordering. The ordering may also serve as a simple format for specifying corticostriatal connections in development...|$|R

Early cotton defoliation {{is an integral part}} of short- season cotton production because it facilitates the mechanical harvesting of cotton and helps reduce insect population in late summer. Effectiveness of the chemical defoliants depends upon the environmental conditions at the time of application. Research was conducted to access the impact of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and water stress at time of defoliation on effectiveness of thidiazuron (Dropp) a chemical defoliant to defoliate cotton grown under field and growth chamber conditions. Humidity was increased by spraying a fine mist over the cotton canopy. Plant moisture stress was achieved by terminating irrigation of cotton at selected times before defoliation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of fractures on fluid flow in reservoir is nowadays a fundamental theme of interest to the oil industry. In the case of carbonate rocks, the study of the contribution of fractures on reservoir efficiency becomes more complex due to the reactive nature of these rocks to circulating fluid and the high tendency to form karst. The fractures act as agents that focus fluid percolation and exert structural control on the formation of karst. For the oil industry, this scenario can be favorable became of the increasing of porosity and permeability of secondary fractures, but also poses risks to the operation. This article investigates, under the geomechanical point of view, how the presence of fractures influence the development of karst observed in carbonate rocks. The Jandaíra Formation was selected as an analogue geomaterial to fractured carbonate reservoirs in marginal basins of Brazil. The methodology adopted for this study included: (i) the use of satellite images, an UAV; (ii) Numeral modeling of the {{effect of the}} current tensions on the flagstone structures.

The {{purpose of these}} studies was to evaluate the seed production capability of woolly cupgrass, seed dormancy factors, and {{the factors that influence}} the germination and emergence of woolly cupgrass. Planting of woolly cupgrass later than the month of May greatly reduced woolly cupgrass yield by reducing the production of tillers, panicles, seed numbers/panicle, the number of seeds/raceme, and plant dry weight;The rate of imbibition between dormant and nondormant seeds was the same. Dehulling promoted the germination of dormant seeds by 60 %. Oxygen levels above atmospheric concentration completely terminated the dormancy of partly dehulled seeds. The oxygen uptake of dehulled dormant and intact nondormant seeds was significantly greater than that of intact dormant woolly cupgrass seeds. Seed leaching did not promote the germination of intact dormant seeds. Leachate from dormant seeds did not inhibit the germination of nondormant seeds.

Prechilling dehulled seeds for 2 weeks and intact dormant seeds for 6 weeks at 5 C, completely terminated the dormancy of woolly cupgrass.

However, receptor density decreases at the anode-facing pole, indicating that elevated AChR density does not initiate receptor aggregation.

The rate at which neuraminidase- and trypsin- treated cells approach steady-state distributions indicates a receptor diffusion constant of ≈ 1. 2 x 10 ^(- 9) cm^ 2 /sec, consistent with a diffusion trap mechanism of receptor aggregation. These results are the first conclusive demonstration that the local concentration of receptors is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce receptor clustering.

The second is to show the independence of Markov's principle from type theory. In the first part we study Newton [...] Puiseux algorithm from a constructive point of view. This is the algorithm used for computing the Puiseux expansions of a plane algebraic curve defined by an affine equation over an algebraically closed <b>field.</b> The <b>termination</b> of this algorithm is usually justified by non-constructive means. By adding a separability condition we obtain {{a variant of the}} algorithm, the termination of which is justified constructively in characteristic $ 0 $. To eliminate the assumption of an algebraically closed base field we present a constructive interpretation of the existence of the separable algebraic closure of a field by building, in a constructive metatheory, a suitable sheaf model where there is such separable algebraic closure. Consequently, one can use this interpretation to extract computational content from proofs involving this assumption. The theorem of Newton [...] Puiseux is one example. We then can find Puiseux expansions of an algebraic curve defined over a non-algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $ 0 $. The expansions are given as a fractional power series over a finite dimensional $K$-algebra. In the second part we show that Markov's principle is independent from type theory. The underlying idea is that Markov's principle does not hold in the topos of sheaves over Cantor space. The presentation in this part is purely syntactical. We build an extension of type theory where the judgments are indexed by basic compact opens of Cantor space. We give an interpretation for this extension of type theory by way of computability predicate and relation. We can then show that Markov's principle is not derivable in this extension and consequently not derivable in type theory...|$|R

Using intracellular recordings combined with fine neuroanatomical techniques, we provide evidence that the female homolog of the male B-glomerulus also acts as a sex pheromone-specific detector. Whereas ordinary glomeruli that process normal environmental odors are innervated by single PNs, the B-glomerulus in both sexes is innervated by multiple PNs, one of which possesses a thicker axon, termed here B-PN.

50|$|The road's {{southern}} end is at North Field Street near the Victory Park neighborhood {{just north of}} Downtown Dallas. It travels northeast for two blocks, turning directly north at Akard Street while also becoming one-way northbound for two blocks past this. At Olive Street, it becomes two-way again, and leaves the downtown area for Uptown Dallas. It then passes under the Katy Trail, over Turtle Creek, and Turtle Creek Boulevard joins it about a block north from there. The two streets run multiplexed for two blocks {{on the west side}} of the creek, then split. Turtle Creek Boulevard continues north-northeast, while Cedar Springs Road turns northwest at Bowen Street. From here, the road runs through one of the financial cores of Dallas, and intersects with Oak Lawn Avenue. The road then cuts through the Oak Lawn neighborhood, and intersects with Wycliff Avenue. The road then crosses over the Dallas North Tollway. Farther northwest, the road intersects with Inwood Road and a few shopping centers. The road finally intersects with Mockingbird Lane and widens to six lanes, where it approaches the terminal at Dallas Love <b>Field</b> and its <b>termination</b> point.|$|R
40|$|Termination {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} undecidable problems in computer science. At the same time, the problem whether a given program terminates for all inputs is sufficiently important for the area of program verification to spur decades-long efforts in developing sufficient criteria for concluding termination. In the last decade, the focus of this research has been on automation, giving rise to several powerful fully automatic termination provers. However, the search problems that arise during the synthesis of a successful termination proof are typically NP-complete. To tackle these algorithmic challenges, over the last years a two-stage process has turned out to be extremely successful in practice: First encode the arising problem instance to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic (SAT), and then invoke a state-of-the-art SAT solver on this SAT instance. The solution found by the SAT solver is then used in the termination proof. While in the worst case still prohibitive due to NP-completeness of SAT, this approach has increased performance on practical problem instances for existing termination techniques by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the approach has also made new automated techniques possible that were out of reach before. This thesis contributes efficient SAT-based automation both for several existing termination techniques and also for new techniques that we have developed in the dependency pair framework for termination analysis of term rewriting. The usefulness of SAT encodings goes beyond the <b>field</b> of <b>termination</b> analysis. We have transferred the approach used for termination techniques to the - at first glance - quite distinct application domain of circuit synthesis, allowing us to obtain a provably optimal implementation of a part of the Advanced Encryption Standard. The contributions of this thesis are implemented within our fully automated termination prover AProVE. The significance of our results is demonstrated also by AProVE reaching the highest scores in the annual International Termination Competitions of 2007 - 2011. At these competitions, the leading automated termination analysis tools try to prove or disprove termination of programs originating from various areas of computer science...|$|R
40|$|Solar energy {{conversion}} using semiconductors to fabricate photovoltaic devices relies on efficient light absorption, charge separation of electron–hole pair carriers or excitons, and fast transport and charge extraction to counter recombination processes. Ferroelectric materials {{are able to}} host a permanent electrical polarization which provides control over electrical field distribution in bulk and interfacial regions. In this review, we provide a critical overview of the physical principles and mechanisms of solar {{energy conversion}} using ferroelectric semiconductors and contact layers, {{as well as the}} main achievements reported so far. In a ferroelectric semiconductor film with ideal contacts, the polarization charge would be totally screened by the metal layers and no charge collection field would exist. However, real materials show a depolarization <b>field,</b> smooth <b>termination</b> of polarization, and interfacial energy barriers that do provide the control of interface and bulk electric field by switchable spontaneous polarization. We explore different phenomena as the polarization-modulated Schottky-like barriers at metal/ferroelectric interfaces, depolarization fields, vacancy migration, and the switchable rectifying behavior of ferroelectric thin films. Using a basic physical model of a solar cell, our analysis provides a general picture of the influence of ferroelectric effects on the actual power conversion efficiency of the solar cell device, and we are able to assess whether these effects or their combinations are beneficial or counterproductive. We describe in detail the bulk photovoltaic effect and the contact layers that modify the built-in field and the charge injection and separation in bulk heterojunction organic cells as well as in photocatalytic and water splitting devices. We also review the dominant families of ferroelectric materials that have been most extensively investigated and have provided the best photovoltaic performance.

40|$|Most of the {{rotational}} luminosity of a pulsar {{is carried}} away by a relativistic magnetised wind in which the matter energy flux is negligible compared to the Poynting flux. Near the equatorial plane of an obliquely rotating pulsar magnetosphere, the magnetic field reverses polarity with the pulsar period, forming a wind with oppositely directed field lines. This structure is called a striped wind; dissipation of alternating fields in the striped wind {{is the object of}} our study. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the conditions required for magnetic energy release at the termination shock of the striped pulsar wind. Magnetic reconnection is considered via analytical methods and 1 D relativistic PIC simulations. An analytical condition on the upstream parameters for partial and full magnetic reconnection is derived from the conservation laws of energy, momentum and particle number density across the relativistic shock. Furthermore, by using a 1 D relativistic PIC code, we study in detail the reconnection process at the termination shock. We found a very simple criterion for dissipation of alternating <b>fields</b> at the <b>termination</b> shock, depending on the upstream parameters of the flow. 1 D relativistic PIC simulations are in agreement with our criterion. Thus, alternating magnetic fields annihilate easily at relativistic highly magnetised shocks. Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|R
40|$|Voyager and Pioneer {{empirical}} {{results show}} that the IMF inside the termination shock behaves much as expected, which is not surprising since the field is essentially passively advected in this region. In contrast, MHD and kinematic models imply the field {{plays a major role in}} the dynamics in some regions of the heliosheath. However, of the many physical ingredients that constitute the outer heliosphere, the magnetic field poses some of the most interesting and difficult problems when being incorporated into 3 D numerical models. Presently, only a few results have been published and much remains to be done. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to press forward with the MHD models. For example, the detailed nature of the field may be important in determining how galactic cosmic rays gain access to the heliosheath. Here I will briefly review the expected behavior of the magnetic <b>field</b> near the <b>termination</b> shock and in the heliosheath and summarize some of the modeling results. I will also review what I believe to be important modeling objectives. Finally, I will speculate on what might be happening with the magnetic field near the nose of the heliosphere and how this might influence plasma transfer across the heliopause...|$|R
