5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of <b>demyelination</b> (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to <b>demyelination</b> of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human <b>demyelination</b> encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of <b>demyelination</b> in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of <b>demyelination</b> but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases {{the risk of developing}} clinical definite MS.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, {{it was found that}} the cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann cells and that the lack of PrP proteins caused <b>demyelination</b> in those cells.|$|E
5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological <b>demyelination</b> can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause <b>demyelination.</b> The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of <b>demyelination,</b> but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E
25|$|In {{multiple}} sclerosis {{there is an}} inflammatory condition together with a neurodegenerative condition. Clinical trials with humanized molecular antibodies {{have shown that the}} inflammation produces the relapses and the <b>demyelination,</b> and an independent neurodegeneration (axonal transection) produces the accumulative disability. Degeneration has been shown to advance even when inflammation and <b>demyelination</b> are detained.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{propose a}} primary {{neurodegenerative}} factor. Maybe the strongest argument supporting this theory {{comes from the}} comparison with NMO. Though autoimmune <b>demyelination</b> is strong, axons are preserved, showing that the standard model of a primary <b>demyelination</b> cannot be hold. The theory of the trans-synaptic degeneration, is compatible with other models based in the CSF biochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{an inflammatory}} disorder {{that results in}} <b>demyelination</b> throughout the central nervous system. The relationship between the location of <b>demyelination</b> and cognitive impairment has not been consistently identified. Retrospective memory has been studied heavily and {{is known to be}} affected negatively by multiple sclerosis. However, a study by Rendell et al. (2006) showed that prospective memory failure is not entirely due to the failure of retrospective memory, and that multiple sclerosis can lead to generalized prospective memory difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immunological demyelinating polyneuropathy. As {{a result}} of increased paranodal capacitance from <b>demyelination,</b> patients experience increased stimulation threshold, shorter strength-duration time constant, and increased rheobase.|$|E
25|$|The scleroses {{that define}} the disease are the {{remainders}} of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient (encephalomyelitis) showing special characteristics, like for example confluent instead of perivenous <b>demyelination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{allergic}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) is {{an animal}} model of CNS inflammation and <b>demyelination</b> frequently used to investigate potential MS treatments. An acute monophasic illness, EAE {{is far more}} similar to ADEM than MS.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) causes <b>demyelination</b> of {{the central}} nervous system. One study found that individuals with MS displayed impaired metamemory for tasks that required high monitoring, but metamemory for easier tasks was not impaired.|$|E
25|$|After barrier {{breakdown}} symptoms may appear, such as swelling. Activation of macrophages and lymphocytes {{and their}} migration across the barrier {{may result in}} direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic <b>demyelination</b> event observed in MS. After <b>demyelination</b> has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as myelin basic proteins and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteins, are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity.|$|E
25|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{also known}} as Devic's disease or Devic's syndrome, is a {{heterogeneous}} condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and <b>demyelination</b> of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). It can be monophasic or recurrent.|$|E
25|$|The {{hallmark}} {{feature of}} diabetic polyneuropathy is {{a blend of}} axonal and demyelinating damage, which results from mechanical <b>demyelination</b> and channel/pump dysfunctions. Diabetic patients have been found to experience a significantly shorter strength-duration time constant and a much higher rheobase than normal patients.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the strength-duration time {{constant}} are observed when this conductance is activated by depolarization, or by hyperventilation. However, <b>demyelination,</b> which exposes internodal membrane {{with a higher}} membrane {{time constant}} {{than that of the}} original node, can also increase strength-duration time constant.|$|E
25|$|While ADEM and MS both involve {{autoimmune}} <b>demyelination,</b> {{they differ}} in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects. Some authors consider MS and its borderline forms {{to constitute a}} spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course, while others consider them discretely different diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Demyelination</b> is {{the act of}} demyelinating, or {{the loss}} of the myelin sheath {{insulating}} the nerves. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, HIV-1-infected {{patients}} often {{suffer from}} myelin degeneration {{in the central}} nervous system. These patients have elevated levels of sulfatide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and anti-sulfatide antibodies in the serum. Elevated levels of anti-sulfatide antibodies can cause <b>demyelination.</b> This {{is caused by the}} binding of the anti-sulfatide antibodies {{to the surface of the}} myelin sheath and/or the surface of Schwann Cells, which then activates a complete cascade of <b>demyelination.</b> Also, advanced stage AIDS patients can develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Guillain–Barré syndrome is classified as an acute autoimmune polyneuropathy, which specifically affects the peripheral nervous system of the infected patient. Experimentation has shown that anti-sulfatide autoimmune antibodies may contribute to the development of Guillain–Barré syndrome in AIDS patients as well as the development of peripheral nervous system injury in HIV-1 infected patients.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the myelin. Myelin acts as an insulating sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and increases the speed at which impulses are conducted. When sulfatide is not distributed properly, it can affect the normal physiological conduction of electrical impulses between nerve cells. This then results in <b>demyelination</b> because of the buildup of sulfatide and is the main cause of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity {{also affects}} {{sulfatide}} levels. When an enhanced antibody response against myelin lipids occurs, including sulfatide {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis, the <b>demyelination</b> process is increased significantly. When sulfatide and gangliosides are present, the proliferation or production of Natural Killer-T cells that produce cytokines are activated. However, when CD1d deficient-mice are tested for their response to sulfatide, the same response is not seen, which indicates that in myelin, sulfatide is a glycolipid that possesses immunodominance.|$|E
25|$|NOGO –The protein family Nogo, {{particularly}} Nogo-A, {{has been}} identified as an inhibitor of remyelination in the CNS, especially in autoimmune mediated <b>demyelination,</b> such as found in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Nogo A functions via either its amino-Nogo terminus through an unknown receptor, or by its Nogo-66 terminus through NgR1, p75, TROY or LINGO1. Antagonising this inhibitor results in improved remyelination, as it is involved in the RhoA pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of alcoholic polyneuropathy {{is an area}} {{of current}} research. Damage to the nervous system takes place before symptoms appear in individuals, beginning with segmental thinning and loss of myelin on the peripheral ends of the longest nerves. Segmental thinning is the <b>demyelination</b> of axons in small sections at a time. This occurrence increases leakage of an action potential current down the axon, so it is weakest at the peripheral end. Decrease in current causes further thinning of myelin.|$|E
25|$|However, how {{sulfatide}} buildup causes <b>demyelination</b> and neural degeneration {{is still}} mostly unknown. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy results in neurological manifestations that are {{centered on the}} impairment of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system, including the following: seizures, progressive coordination and speech problems, and behavioral disturbances. Treatment is still being studied and evaluated, but mice studies indicate that treatments, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies using oligodendrocyte progenitors cells, enzyme replacement therapy, or adeno-associated viral and lentiviral mediated gene therapy may prove to be effective in reducing the effects of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is {{the most}} common form of {{hereditary}} neuropathy and can be further subdivided into two types: Type 1: demyelinating, and Type 2: axonal. Measurement of chronaxie and rheobase for these diseased nerves has concluded that electrophysiologically, a patient with demyelinating (Type I) CMT demonstrates slow nerve conduction velocity, frequently accompanied by reduced amplitudes of motor and sensory action potentials; moreover, axonal (Type II) CMT can be attributed to impaired interaction between Schwann cells and axons. Changes in excitability measures are typically universal and vary little between patients, and this is likely due to the diffuse distribution of <b>demyelination,</b> suggesting changed cable properties associated with short internodes.|$|E
25|$|Rheobase is {{influenced}} by excitability of the nodal membrane, which increases with hyperpolarization and decreases with depolarization. Its voltage-dependence follows the behavior of persistent sodium channels that are active near threshold and have rapidly activating, slowly inactivating channel properties. Depolarization increases the Na+ current through the persistent channels, resulting in a lower rheobase; hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. The strength-duration time constant increases with <b>demyelination,</b> as the exposed membrane is enlarged by inclusion of paranodal and internodal membrane. The function of the latter of these is to maintain resting membrane potential, so internodal dysfunction significantly affects excitability in a diseased nerve. Such implications are further discussed in Clinical Significance.|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of the nodal membrane largely determine the axon's strength-duration properties, and these will change with changes in membrane potential, with temperature, and with <b>demyelination</b> as the exposed membrane is effectively enlarged by the inclusion of paranodal and intermodal membrane. Thus, the strength-duration time constant {{is a reflection of}} persistent Na+ channel function, and is furthermore influenced by membrane potential and passive membrane properties. As such, many aspects of nerve excitability testing depend on sodium channel functions: namely, the strength-duration time constant, the recovery cycle, the stimulus-response curve, and the current-threshold relationship. Measuring responses in nerve that are related to nodal function (including strength-duration time constant and rheobase) and internodal function has allowed insight into normal axon physiology as well as normal fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Thin neurons and axons {{require less}} {{metabolic}} expense {{to produce and}} carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in {{the central nervous system}} and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from <b>demyelination</b> of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. <b>Demyelination</b> (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and <b>demyelination</b> will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is subacute combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and <b>demyelination</b> were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.|$|E
25|$|The main {{occupational}} risks {{posed by}} this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, {{although there is}} a risk of subsequent pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent. In the United States, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1mg/m3: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show <b>demyelination,</b> loss of axons and gliosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental <b>demyelination</b> extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in resting potential, such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial <b>demyelination</b> (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of conduction velocity and amplitudes of compound motor (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength duration time constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the recovery cycle after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E
