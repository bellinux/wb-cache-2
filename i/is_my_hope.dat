500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E

It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope,</b> President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

2500|$|Ibárruri {{offered a}} string of speeches, some of them radio {{broadcasts}} from Madrid: [...] "Danger! To arms!" [...] (July 19), [...] "Our fighters must lack for nothing!"

[...] (September 3), [...] "A salute to our militiawomen on the front line" [...] (September 4), [...] "Our battle cry has been heard by the whole world" [...] (September 15). It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied {{to the side of the}} Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, [...] "You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock.
