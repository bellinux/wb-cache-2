40|$|How are {{eco-label}} strategies {{affected by}} consumer confusion {{arising from the}} profusion of eco-labels? This article provides a theoretical insight into this issue using a double differentiation framework. We assume that consumers perceive a label {{as a sign of}} quality compared to an unlabeled product, but that they can't distinguish the environmental quality associated with each label. They only perceive each label as a particular variety of the product. We deduce preferences for two types of label: a <b>health</b> <b>label</b> and an eco-label. We analyze pricing strategies of three firms each providing one product: a <b>health</b> <b>labeled,</b> eco-labeled or an unlabeled product. We infer lessons for eco-labeling policies, through effects of ecolabeling on welfare components, according to the identity of the certifying organization: the regulator, who aims at enhancing welfare, an NGO, which attempts to enhance the quality of the environment, and the firms, which seek to maximize their profits. We show that the firm supplying the eco-labeled product is weakened by consumer confusion while the firms selling the unlabeled product suffers from strict labels, to the benefit of the firm supplying the <b>health</b> <b>labeled</b> product. All label policies imply, whatever the certifying organization, high identical environmental quality of the labeled products, which leads to a reduction in the market share of the unlabeled product or even to its extinction...|$|R

40|$|Objective : To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} front-of-pack labels on taste perception and use of table salt for currently available and sodium-reduced soups. Design : Within-subject design. Setting : Sensory laboratory. Subjects : Participants (n 50, mean age 34 · 8 (sd 13 · 6) years) were randomly served nine soups (250 ml each) across 3 d. Servings differed in: (i) <b>health</b> <b>label</b> (i. e. no <b>health</b> <b>label,</b> reduced-salt label or Heart Foundation Tick); and (ii) sodium reduction (no reduction – benchmark, 15 % less sodium or 30 % less sodium). Before tasting, participants rated their expected salt intensity and liking. After tasting, participants rated their perceived salt intensity and liking, after which they could add salt to the soup {{to make it more}} palatable. Results : Reduced-salt labels generated a negative taste expectation and actual taste experience in terms of liking (P < 0 · 05) and perceived saltiness (P < 0 · 05). Perceived saltiness of sodium-reduced soups decreased more (P < 0 · 05), and consumers added more salt (P < 0 · 05), when soups carried the reduced-salt label. The tick logo and soups without <b>health</b> <b>labels</b> had no such influence on taste perception. Conclusions : Emphasizing salt reduction by means of a front-of-pack label can {{have a negative effect on}} taste perception and salt use, especially when consumers are able to taste differences between their regular soup and the sodium-reduced soup. Overall health logos which do not emphasize the reduction in salt are less likely to affect perceived salt intensity and therefore are viable solutions to indicate the healthiness of sodium-reduced products...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{credence}} {{nature of}} functional food attributes labelling {{plays a key}} role in allowing consumers to make informed choices about foods with enhanced health attributes. The degree to which a particular jurisdiction permits health claims for food products and the type of allowable health claim influence the information set available to consumers. In Canada the regulatory environment governing health claims for functional food products is somewhat more restrictive than in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Food manufacturers therefore also use visual imagery to suggest a health benefit, such as the picture of a red heart to imply that a product has heart health benefits. The paper characterizes these labelling strategies as “partial labelling”, while “full labelling’’ refers to formal health claims on food labels, ranging from general (structure-function) claims, to risk reduction claims, to disease prevention claims. This paper explores the effect of labelling (full and partial) on consumers’ functional food choices. How might different types of labelling information and the verification of health claims by different agencies affect consumers’ preferences for functional foods? Using data from an online survey of 740 Canadians conducted in summer 2009 the paper uses discrete choice modelling to examine the responses of Canadian consumers to different product labelling strategies for milk enhanced with Omega- 3. Conditional Logit and Latent Class models are estimated. Preliminary results suggest that full labelling is preferred over partial labelling, but primarily for risk reduction claims. There is no significant difference between a function claim, such as “good for your heart” and partial labelling in the form of a red heart symbol. The choice experiment included verification of health claims by a government agency (Health Canada) or by a third party (Heart and Stroke Foundation). The preliminary results suggest that consumers on average respond positively to verification of health claims, however, the latent class model reveals considerable heterogeneity in consumer attitudes toward the source of verification. Interactions between key-socio-demographic and attitudinal variables and the main effects variables in the choice experiment provide further insights into consumer responses.

40|$|The Government {{welcomes the}} opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice on minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol products, which was {{published}} this morning, and is encouraged by some aspects. The Minister for Health stated: “I am encouraged by {{the opinion of}} the Advocate General which indicates that minimum unit pricing may be compatible with EU law if it can be shown to be more effective than other alternative measures. Therefore, I will be asking my officials to study his opinion and its implications as we wait for the final judgment of the Court which is expected {{towards the end of the}} year,” Minister Varadkar said. “In the meantime, the publication of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill remains a priority. This Bill is now at an advanced stage and I look forward to publishing the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the coming weeks. ” The Bill includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, structural separation, <b>health</b> <b>labelling</b> on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol, the regulation of sports sponsorship and restrictions on certain promotional activities. The proposed Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 is part of a suite of measures designed to reduce alcohol consumption and limit the damage to the nation’s health, society and economy. ENDS Additional brief Advocate General Opinion The Advocate General stated: “A Member State can, in order to pursue the objective of combating alcohol abuse, which forms part of the objective of the protection of public health, choose rules that impose a minimum retail price of alcoholic beverages that restrict trade within the European Union and distorts competition, rather than increased taxation of those products, only on condition that it shows that the measure chosen has additional advantages or fewer disadvantages than the alternative measure”. Minimum Unit Pricing Addressing the price of alcohol is an important component of any long-term strategic approach to tackling alcohol misuse. The price of alcohol is directly linked to consumption levels and levels of alcohol related harms and costs i. e. as the price increases, consumption rates and harms decrease. The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price. Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol. The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product. The sale price of the alcohol product, in both the on and off trade sector, could not be below this minimum unit price. MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices. MUP will target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink. Alcohol products which are strong and cheap are those favoured by the heaviest drinkers, who are most at risk of alcohol-related illness and death and young people who have the least disposable income. The University of Sheffield study (Model-Based Appraisal of Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in the Republic of Ireland, 2013 (2014) noted that MUP would only have a small impact on alcohol consumption for low risk drinkers. Somewhat larger impacts would be experienced by increasing risk drinkers, with the most substantial effects being experienced by high risk drinkers. MUP is not expected to affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade. The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i. e. supermarkets and off-licences. The price will be set when the Bill is published and will be at a level that the evidence shows will reduce the burden of harm from alcohol. Discussion on the commencement of this measure is ongoing with our colleagues in Northern Ireland...|$|E

It is important to evaluate the efficacy of information communicated to consumers. The experimental study among 209 Dutch consumers compared the effect of <b>health</b> and hedonic <b>labels</b> on consumer scepticism toward the labels and consumer responses to food products (apple juice and a chocolate cookie) under three presentation conditions (visual, visual–tactile and multisensory). The results demonstrated that consumers were more sceptical toward the hedonic label than toward the <b>health</b> <b>label.</b> The influence of consumer scepticism on product experience, product evaluation and purchase intention varied for different product categories. For a hedonic product (a chocolate cookie), the hedonic label had a more positive effect on consumer responses compared to the <b>health</b> <b>label.</b> The results also showed that the multisensory presentation reduced scepticism and enhanced product evaluation for the hedonic product compared to the visual and tactile presentations. The results suggest that multisensory experience may alter consumer scepticism toward food labels and thus product evaluation and consumer choice. Our findings can be useful for food manufacturers and policy makers in evaluating the efficacy of food labels and information presented on food packages...|$|R

Participants ranging from 19 to 67. years of age (28 females, 18 males, mean age 45. 3 ± 13. 7. years) were invited to come to a central location to taste a variety of soups. Consumers tasted the same soup with different labels (e. g. now reduced in salt, healthy choices-tick logo) in a within-subjects design. Before and after consumers tasted the soup, they were asked to rate liking, saltiness, and desire to consume the soup. The results suggest that consumers expected the salt taste intensity (P< 0. 001) to be lower when the label stated "now reduced in salt", compared to the soup without such label. Furthermore, consumers expected the soup with the tick logo to be more liked than the same soup with the tick logo and the "now reduced salt" label (P= 0. 1). After consumers tasted the soups, no differences in liking or desire were found between the soups with the different labels. This study suggests that labels which notify consumers of a reduction in salt may have an adverse effect on consumers 2 ̆ 7 expectation and potentially on the actual perceived taste of products...|$|R
