5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Rhytismataceae. A {{widespread}} species, particularly in temperate areas, it colonizes the dead <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> of vascular plants, particularly oak and chestnut. The fungus apothecia, which form in the epidermal layer of the leaf host, resemble dark hexagonal spots scattered on a multi-colored mosaic pattern bounded by thin black lines. When mature, the apothecia open by triangular flaps to release spores. The anamorph form of C.dentatus is Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. Lookalike species can be distinguished by {{the shape of the}} apothecia, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. It is a common and {{abundant}} species in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> and acorns of various oak species. First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E

5|$|Hollyleaf's Story was {{released}} on 3 March 2012. It details Hollyleaf's experiences beginning from when she is buried {{in a set of}} tunnels at the conclusion of Sunrise until she goes to the tunnels beneath ThunderClan territory to find Ivypool and Dovewing spying on Sol and a group of WindClan cats (in The Forgotten Warrior). When she first goes into the cave, she is saved by <b>Fallen</b> <b>Leaves,</b> the spirit of an ancient cat who died in the tunnels, and lives with him for the remainder of her time in the caves. The novella describes various ways in which she continues to help ThunderClan during her absence.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>leaves</b> are biodegraded and {{composted}} {{naturally in}} forests {{but they are}} wastes for urban areas. Moreover, they are widely available cellulose sources but have limited applications. Alkaline peroxide treatment of bioresources {{is one of the}} most widely studied clean methods for both delignification and hemicellulose removal but there is no study about application of that method on <b>fall</b> <b>leaves</b> at room temperature. In this study, the effect of alkaline peroxide treatment of <b>fall</b> <b>leaves</b> at room temperature on hemicellulose recovery and cellulose delignification were investigated. <b>Fall</b> <b>leaves</b> (FL) were treated with 0. 3 3. 0 M NaOH + 0 3 M H 2 O 2 at room temperature. Hemicellulose recovery and cellulose delignification values were analyzed. Hemicellulose recovery and cellulose delignification increased and yield decreased by increasing NaOH and H 2 O 2 concentrations. Hemicellulose recovery and cellulose delignification reached the maximum levels, 99. 5 % and 81. 6 % respectively, at 3 M NaOH + 3 M H 2 O 2 treatment condition. The end products were confirmed by analytically, spectrally and morphologically. Wasted <b>fall</b> <b>leaves</b> were turned into useful hemicellulose and cellulose products by using clean alkaline peroxide treatment at room temperature. The products can be further processed by known methods into other industrial products...|$|R

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves,</b> so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E

5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of <b>fallen</b> <b>leaves</b> or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E

30|$|As an {{important}} autumn feature, scenes {{with large numbers}} of <b>falling</b> <b>leaves</b> are common in movies and games. However, it is a challenge for computer graphics to simulate such scenes in an authentic and efficient manner. This paper proposes a GPU based approach for simulating the falling motion of many leaves in real time. Firstly, we use a motionsynthesis based method to analyze the falling motion of the leaves, which enables us to describe complex falling trajectories using low-dimensional features. Secondly, we transmit a primitive-motion trajectory dataset together with the low-dimensional features of the <b>falling</b> <b>leaves</b> to video memory, allowing us to execute the appropriate calculations on the GPU.|$|R
