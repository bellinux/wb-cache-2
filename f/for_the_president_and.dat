25|$|The premier is {{selected}} by the president {{without the need for}} approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated {{in the office of the}} president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.|$|E

25|$|In modern practice, {{each state}} chooses its electors in popular elections. Once chosen, the electors meet in their {{respective}} states to cast ballots <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Vice President. Originally, each elector cast two votes for President; {{at least one of}} the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The individual with the majority of votes became President, and the runner-up became Vice President. In case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors, the House of Representatives would choose one of the tied candidates; if no person received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a President. If second-place candidates were tied, then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum in the House consisted of at least one member from two-thirds of the state delegations; there was no special quorum for the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a deadlock in the House.|$|E
