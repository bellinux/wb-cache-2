25|$|Production {{capacity}} in Britain and the United States was improved by {{the invention of}} the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude <b>ginning</b> machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a Middle-Eastern country that had an {{advanced}} economy in the early 19th century was Ottoman Egypt, which had a highly productive industrial manufacturing sector, and per-capita income that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as France and {{higher than that of}} Japan and Eastern Europe. Other parts of the Ottoman Empire, particularly Syria and southeastern Anatolia, also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century. In 1819, Egypt under Muhammad Ali began programs of state-sponsored industrialization, which included setting up factories for weapons production, an iron foundry, large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for <b>ginning,</b> spinning and weaving of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing. By the early 1830s, Egypt had 30 cotton mills, employing about 30,000 workers. In the early 19th century, Egypt had the world's fifth most productive cotton industry, {{in terms of the number}} of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. While steam power had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in 1551, when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine, it was under Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing. Boilers were manufactured and installed in Egyptian industries such as ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills, and hulling mills. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the Nile. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{crushing}} of the riots of 1964, {{a power struggle}} started within the Military Committee between Minister of Defence Muhammad Umran, and Salah Jadid. Umran, the committee's most senior member, wanted reconciliation with the rioters {{and an end to}} confrontation with the middle class, in contrast, Jadid believed the solution was to coerce and repress the protesters so as to save the 8th of March Revolution. This was the first open schism within the Military Committee, and would prove decisive in coming events. With Hafez al-Assad's support, the Military Committee initiated a violent counter-attack on the rioters This decision led to Umran's downfall. He responded by revealing the Military Committee's plan of taking over the Ba'ath Party to the party's National Command. Aflaq, the Secretary General of the National Command, responded to the information by ordering the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Command. He was forced to withdraw his request because the party's [...] rose in protest. When an old guard Ba'athist tauntingly asked Aflaq [...] "how big a role his party still played in government", Aflaq replied [...] "About one-thousandth of one percent". Umran's revelations to the National Command led to his exile, and with the National Command impotent, the Military Committee, through its control of the Syrian Regional Command, initiated an attack on the bourgeoisie and initiated a nationalisation drive which extended state ownership to electricity generation, oil distribution, cotton <b>ginning,</b> and to an estimated 70 percent of foreign trade.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gin</b> 4, a Nim 1 -related kinase, is {{required}} in budding yeast for localization of the septins and for proper control of daughter cell growth during G 2 /M. <b>Gin</b> 4 becomes hyperphosphorylated when cells enter mitosis, leading to activation of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity. In this study, we have used immunoaffinity chromatography to identify proteins that associate with <b>Gin</b> 4 during mitosis, {{with the goal of}} finding targets of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity and proteins that play a role in <b>Gin</b> 4 activation. We show that during mitosis <b>Gin</b> 4 is assembled into a multiprotein complex that includes Nap 1, Bni 5, the septins, and at least two molecules of <b>Gin</b> 4. The associated <b>Gin</b> 4 molecules present in this complex phosphorylate each other, leading to <b>Gin</b> 4 hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, the Shs 1 septin present in the complex undergoes <b>Gin</b> 4 -dependent phosphorylation during mitosis and appears to be a substrate of <b>Gin</b> 4 in vitro, suggesting that it is a target of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity in vivo. Genetic data support the idea that Shs 1 is an important target of <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase activity. Association of <b>Gin</b> 4 with the septins during mitosis requires Shs 1, Nap 1, Cla 4, Elm 1, and the kinase activities of <b>Gin</b> 4 and Cdc 28. Self-association of <b>Gin</b> 4 molecules requires Shs 1 but not Cla 4 or Nap 1. Previous work has suggested that the septins function together as a tight complex, and we found {{that the majority of the}} Shs 1 in the cell is tightly bound to the other septins Cdc 3, Cdc 10, Cdc 11, and Cdc 12. Interestingly, however, Shs 1 can bind to <b>Gin</b> 4 and induce <b>Gin</b> 4 oligomerization under conditions in which the Cdc 11 septin does not bind to <b>Gin</b> 4, suggesting that Shs 1 can function independently of the other septins. Taken together, these findings suggest that highly regulated protein-binding events ensure that the <b>Gin</b> 4 kinase is activated only during mitosis and only in association with Shs 1, a likely in vivo substrate of <b>Gin</b> 4. In addition, these results provide clues to how <b>Gin</b> 4 may regulate the localization or function of the septins...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was at this}} point, probably, {{where the}} first idea of a [...] "Freedman's Bureau" [...] took its origin. Orders of the {{government}} prohibited the expulsion of the negroes from {{the protection of the}} army, when they came in voluntarily. Humanity forbade allowing them to starve. With such an army of them, of all ages and both sexes, as had congregated about Grand Junction, amounting to many thousands, it was impossible to advance. There was no special authority for feeding them unless they were employed as teamsters, cooks and pioneers with the army; but only able-bodied young men were suitable for such work. This labor would support but a very limited percentage of them. The plantations were all deserted; the cotton and corn were ripe: men, women and children above ten years of age could be employed in saving these crops. To do this work with contrabands, or to have it done, organization under a competent chief was necessary. On inquiring for such a man Chaplain Eaton, now and for many years the very able United States Commissioner of Education, was suggested. He proved as efficient in that field as he has since done in his present one. I gave him all the assistants and guards he called for. We together fixed the prices to be paid for the negro labor, whether rendered to the government or to individuals. The cotton was to be picked from abandoned plantations, the laborers to receive the stipulated price (my recollection is twelve and a half cents per pound for picking and <b>ginning)</b> from the quartermaster, he shipping the cotton north to be sold {{for the benefit of the}} government. Citizens remaining on their plantations were allowed the privilege of having their crops saved by freedmen on the same terms.|$|E
