40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{the use of}} unequally {{protected}} key {{pictures to}} prevent temporal error propagation in error-prone video communications. The <b>key</b> <b>picture</b> may either be an intra-coded picture or a picture using a long-term motion compensation reference picture through reference picture selection. The inter-coded <b>key</b> <b>picture</b> uses previous key pictures as motion compensation reference. Key pictures are better protected than other pictures using forward error correction in either source or transport coding. Simulation results show significantly improved error resiliency performance of the proposed technique compared to conventional methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Much debate exists about postbureaucratic {{organizational}} {{forms that}} are sometimes felt {{to strengthen the}} polarization between good and bad jobs. Small firms provide one test in that they lack bureaucracy. Such firms from two contrasting sectors, food manufacture and the media, are used to assess, respectively, the models of good and bad jobs. Data from 66 firms and 203 employees show a mixed picture: Food jobs are bad for pay but relatively good for autonomy. Media jobs offer autonomy, but this is constrained by tight performance demands and low pay. These results help to explain why national surveys find no polarization in terms of autonomy and are explained by the economic contingencies of the two sectors. Ordinariness rather than stark polarization is the <b>key</b> <b>picture...</b>|$|E

40|$|Packet-based {{fidelity}} scalability (PFS) is {{a desirable}} feature in many video coding or transmission applications. Any realization of PFS in a hybrid video coding approach, however, requires suitable concepts for controlling drift and for generating sufficiently small increments in bit rate {{in order to}} allow progressive refinements of perceptual quality relative to a given base layer quality. This paper addresses those problems {{in the context of the}} scalable video coding (SVC) extension of H. 264 /AVC. We present an algorithmically simple but yet remarkably wellperforming method for packet-based fidelity scalability that is maximally consistent with the existing entropy coding design of H. 264 /AVC, allows sufficiently small increments in bit rate, and has been adopted as a normative element of SVC. We also discuss the benefits of the <b>key</b> <b>picture</b> concept of SVC in view of our proposed PFS approach. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for a few selected SVC conforming encoder configurations.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Key-Frame-Free (KFF) {{prediction}} method for the medium-grain scalable (MGS) coding of H. 264 /SVC, {{in which the}} key pictures can be completely avoided to reduce the memory complexity and improve the coding efficiency. In our proposed method, the encoder employs a joint rate-distortion model to decide which quality layer is reconstructed and used for prediction of base quality macroblocks in the coarsest temporal layer, while the remaining macroblocks always predict and reconstruct from the highest quality layer. The proposed method requires no change to the H. 264 /SVC standard and experimental results show that compared with the MGS key-picture control method the proposed scheme significantly improves the scalable coding efficiency from 0. 8 to 1. 5 dB at higher bit rates while maintains similar drift error as MGS with key pictures at lower bit rates. Our proposed method can also coexist with SVC-to-AVC rewrite function which is conflict with the <b>key</b> <b>picture</b> of MGS. Index Terms — MGS, H. 264 /SVC, key-frame, scalable coding 1...|$|E

The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by an experimental analysis of temporal versus inter-view prediction in terms of the Lagrange cost function. The results show that prediction with temporal reference pictures is highly efficient, but for 20 % of a picture's blocks on average prediction with reference pictures; from adjacent views is more efficient.

As Schlüsselbild (<b>key</b> <b>picture),</b> a photographic image with national, cultural and political symbolic characteristic, these photographs play as Bilderakte (image acts) play a crucial and active part in the designing and representing history for future interpretation, based remembering of the World War Two and the collapse of the Third Reich and the national reconstruction of post- 1945 identity and narrative. This thesis analyzes the compositional appeal of this particular photographic sequence, consisting of several icon key pictures, which have been reproduced in schoolbooks, films, exhibitions and historiography, among other publication platforms. In an examination of documentation of this particular event and its rhetoric importance and the functioning of photography in visualizing and co-design/co-influence the discourse of future representation of the event, the national narrative and myth creation, this thesis addresses beside the compositional appeal and classification of the photographs as Schlüsselbild or Schlagbild (pictorial slogan) on the traditional function of such victory images, it explores the function of such photographs in context of war and to allocate ‘pre-images’ of visualizing epochal changeovers or beginning of new political time periods. The specificity and functionality of ‘documenting’ visually historical changeovers from the perspective of politics, shows secondly in a case study of two reproductions of the Reichstag icon in the context of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the formative power of photography in the political argumentation process of the ‘liberation’ myth the function of image between the ‘documentary’ evidence and the ‘symbolic’ political message that is argued by the elites of the GDR. The analysis examines one of the possible interpretation of the photographs in the post- 1945 political context and the construction of the mythological national narrative and collective memory. Taking the example of the official GDR’s official functionalization and interpretation of the iconic Reichstag sequence, this thesis is an attempt to demonstrate one example of the long pictorial tradition of visually capturing history in order to actively shape and co-determine the reception of the past event influence the future national identity construction and political argumentation communicated and generated by historical key images...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The newly adopted {{scalable}} {{extension of}} H. 264 /AVC video coding standard (SVC) demonstrates {{significant improvements in}} coding efficiency {{in addition to an}} increased degree of supported scalability relative to the scalable profiles of prior video coding standards. Due to the complicated hierarchical prediction structure of the SVC and the concept of <b>key</b> <b>pictures,</b> content-aware rate adaptation of SVC bit streams to intermediate bit rates is a nontrivial task. The concept of quality layers has been introduced {{in the design of the}} SVC to allow for fast content-aware prioritized rate adaptation. However, existing quality layer assignment methods are suboptimal and do not consider all network abstraction layer (NAL) units from different layers for the optimization. In this paper, we first propose a technique to accurately and efficiently estimate the quality degradation resulting from discarding an arbitrary number of NAL units from multiple layers of a bitstream by properly taking drift into account. Then, we utilize this distortion estimation technique to assign quality layers to NAL units for a more efficient extraction. Experimental results show that a significant gain can be achieved by the proposed scheme. I...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{encoding}} and indexing of audiovisual {{documents are}} two key aspects for enhancing the multimedia user experience. In this {{paper we propose}} the embedding of low-level content descriptors into a scalable video coding bit-stream by jointly optimizing encoding and indexing performance. This approach provides {{a new type of}} bit-stream where part of the information is used for both content encoding and content description, allowing the so called ”Midstream Content Access”. To support this concept, a novel technique based on the appropriate combination of Vector Quantization and Scalable Video Coding has been developed and evaluated. More specifically, the key-pictures of each video GOP are encoded at a first draft level by using an optimal visual-codebook, while the residual errors are encoded using a conventional approach. The same visual-codebook is also used to encode all the <b>key</b> <b>pictures</b> of a video shot, which boundaries are dynamically estimated. In this way, the visual-codebook is freely available as an efficient visual descriptor of the considered video shot.

[...] In his monograph, The Cinema of Loneliness: Penn, Stone, Kubrick, Scorsese, Spielberg, Altman, Robert Kolker writes, [...] "Night Moves was Penn's point of turning, his last carefully structured work, a strong and bitter film, whose bitterness emerges from an anxiety and from a loneliness that exists as a given, rather than a loneliness fought against, a fight that marks most of Penn's best work. Night Moves is a film of impotence and despair, and it {{marks the end of}} a cycle of films." [...] Dennis Schwartz characterizes the film as [...] "a seminal modern noir work from the 1970s" [...] and adds, [...] "This is arguably the best film that Arthur Penn has ever done."
