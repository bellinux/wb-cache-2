5|$|Both <b>ixodid</b> and argasid ticks {{have four}} {{lifecycle}} stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult.|$|E
5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both <b>ixodid</b> and argasid ticks {{by a combination of}} a projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, leathery skin. Other distinguish characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{have four}} stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. <b>Ixodid</b> ticks have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their lifecycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans and other animals.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), <b>ixodid</b> ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike <b>ixodid</b> ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, <b>ixodid</b> ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ixodid</b> ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven <b>ixodid</b> tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although <b>ixodid</b> ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>ixodid</b> ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
25|$|Guided by the palps, the chelicerae {{cut into}} the skin with their {{horizontal}} cutting action. These rip and tear at the epidermal layers and a small pool of blood is formed. The hypostome is inserted and this provides the initial attachment strength. In the case of Ixodes holocyclus the hypostome is inserted very deep into the dermis. The palps remain spread apart on the surface. The process by which <b>Ixodid</b> and Argasid ticks feed is termed telmophagy (= pool feeding). (This contrasts {{with the process of}} solenophagy, used by mosquitos, in which feeding is direct from a small venule.) The resultant pool expands {{as a result of the}} anticoagulants released from the salivary glands. In some <b>Ixodid</b> ticks a cementum is secreted into the wound within 5–30 minutes of cutting into the skin. This material hardens quickly into a latex-like covering around the mouthparts but excluding the palps that remain flattened out on the skin surface. Ixodes holocyclus, however, is one of the <b>Ixodid</b> ticks which does not produce cementum.|$|E
25|$|For hard (<b>Ixodid)</b> ticks it is {{virtually}} impossible for mechanical transmission to occur on its own (i.e. without some replication), as they tend to not take multiple blood meals from different hosts in the one stage. Passing an organism between tick stages (trans-stadial transmission) seemingly requires that an organism can also replicate within the tick.|$|E
25|$|Blood meal {{digestion}} in ticks {{is similar}} in all species. The digestive system in both <b>Ixodid</b> and argasid ticks is histologically divided into foregut, midgut and hindgut. The foregut comprises the sucking pharynx and the oesophagus. The midgut contains a ventriculus with a valve, a variable number of blind diverticula (caeca), and a rectal tube. The hindgut is divided into a rectal bulb and the rectum itself.|$|E
2500|$|Ticks {{generally}} are obligate blood feeders. All active stages (larvae, nymphs and adults) require blood {{as a source}} of nutrition (except for a few Argasid genera in which the adult mouthparts are non-functional, i.e. Antricola, Otobius and Nothoaspis). Adults also require the blood for sperm or egg production. The feeding process of <b>Ixodid</b> ticks has first a slow phase for several days followed by a fast phase in the last 12–24 hours before detachment. There may be a tenfold increase in fed: unfed weights {{by the end of the}} slow phase, but there is an additional tenfold increase by the end of the final fast phase. Leaving the full engorgement as late as possible reduces the chances of detection and removal by the host. The process of feeding is called engorging. The hypostome has a groove along its dorsal surface forming a food canal (also known as the preoral canal) through which blood is drawn from the host and passed on to the mouth and pharynx. During blood feeding by <b>Ixodid</b> ticks, the liquid portion of the meal is first concentrated by removal of water and excess ions, which move across the gut epithelium and enter the ticks body cavity (hemocoele). These components are then taken up by the salivary glands which produce a watery saliva that is injected back into the host ...|$|E
