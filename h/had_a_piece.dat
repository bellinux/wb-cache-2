5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as {{every single one of}} the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost a third of the crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E

These issues were attended to while the ship was refurnished with items borrowed from the Cunard vessels Transylvania and Carmania.|$|E
25|$|Casas {{was born}} in Barcelona. His father had made a fortune in Matanzas, Cuba; his mother was from a well-off Catalan family. In 1877 he {{abandoned}} the regular course of schooling to study art in the studio of Joan Vicens. In 1881, still in his teens, he was a co-founder of the magazine L'Avenç; the 9 October 1881 issue included his sketch of the cloister of Sant Benet in Bages. That same month, accompanied by his cousin Miquel Carbó i Carbó, a medical student, he began his first stay in Paris, where he studied that winter at the Carolus Duran Academy and later at the Gervex Academy, and functioned as a Paris correspondent for L'Avenç. The next year he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> exhibited in Barcelona at the Sala Parés, and in 1883 in Paris the Salon des Champs Elysées exhibited his portrait of himself dressed as a flamenco dancer; the piece won him an invitation {{as a member of}} the salon of the Societé d'artistes françaises.|$|E

500|$|The 1860s were Offenbach's most {{successful}} decade. At {{the beginning of}} 1860, he was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon III, and the following year he was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur; this appointment scandalised those haughty and exclusive members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera. Offenbach began the decade with his only stand-alone ballet, Le papillon ("The Butterfly"), produced at the Opéra in 1860. It achieved {{what was then a}} successful run of 42 performances, without, as the biographer Andrew Lamb says, [...] "giving him any greater acceptance in more respectable circles." [...] Among other operettas in the same year, he finally <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> presented by the Opéra-Comique, the three-act Barkouf. It was not a success; its plot revolved around a dog, and Offenbach attempted canine imitations in his music. Neither the public nor the critics were impressed, and the piece survived for only seven performances.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Zhou Dynasty, {{a formal}} system of court and {{ceremonial}} music later termed yayue (meaning [...] "elegant music") was established.

The word [...] "dance" [...] (舞) similarly also refers to music, and every dance would have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of music associated with it. [...] The most important set of music of the period was the Six-dynasty Music Dance (六代樂舞) performed in rituals in the royal court. Music in the Zhou Dynasty was conceived as a cosmological manifestation of the sound of nature integrated into the binary universal order of yin and yang, and this concept has enduring influence later Chinese thinking on music. [...] "Correct" [...] music according to Zhou concept would involve instruments correlating to the five elements of nature and would bring harmony to nature.

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs.
