Any would-be predators that pass by after a worm has lost its crown will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the worm has died; this protects the animal from further attack. The crown typically reappears after about two weeks. When it does reappear, it is initially smaller in size, but it eventually grows back to its former size and color.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is a {{rotating}} reference frame. To solve classical mechanics problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, {{but they can be}} detected under careful conditions. For example, LÃ©on Foucault was able to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If the Earth were to maintain its current shape but rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel--those in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, the last {{chief of the}} Natchez arrived at the Tunica village with a hundred men, and {{an unknown number of}} women and children. They also {{concealed}} Chickasaw and Koroa in the canebrake around the village. Cahura-Joligo informed them that he could not receive them unless they gave up their arms. They replied that this was their intention, but asked if they could keep them awhile longer so their women did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> their unarmed men were prisoners. He consented to their request and proceeded to distribute food to his new guests. A celebratory dance was held till after midnight, when the Tunica retired to their cabins, thinking that the Natchez would do the same. The Natchez, Chicasaw and Koroa, attacked their hosts in their cabins, and killed all they managed to surprise while asleep. Cahura-Joligo killed four Natchez during the fighting, but was eventually killed along with twelve of his warriors. His war-chief Brides les Boeufs (Buffalo Tamer), with a dozen of his warriors, repulsed the attack and retook the Head Chief's cabin. He rallied his remaining warriors and, after fighting for five days and nights without interruption, regained control of the village. Twenty Tunica were killed and as many wounded in the fighting. They had killed 33 Natchez warriors and took three prisoners. Later they burned them in ritual punishment for the attack.|$|E

[...] Dan Iverson of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode positively, noting that the episode [...] "would make even the most anti-Family Guy television viewers out there laugh pretty hard." [...] Iverson went on to comment, however, that [...] "it probably won't be remembered as fondly as some {{of the episode}}s from the first few seasons." [...] For him, the [...] "funniest aspect of the episode" [...] was the radio scene, in which [...] "we <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> [...] are immature, simple-minded idiots." [...] Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode slightly more negatively, stating that [...] "the whole Peter story just didn't do much for me." [...] Love did find that the [...] "Stewie and Brian stuff was {{the best part of the}} episode," [...] but went on to proclaim that [...] "there are 20 more episodes to get it right."

[...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal with what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E

Pitchfork stated that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about Glass Swords is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks" [...] and that [...] "there's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a [...] "greatest bits" [...] collage."

500|$|Murad's force {{contained}} approximately 80,000 men and two cannons, {{which could}} fire [...] balls. His army contained a fresh corps of Janissaries, and 3,000 debtors and bankrupts fighting {{to regain their}} freedom. The Count of Gurrica persuaded Skanderbeg to incorporate a scorched earth strategy, by destroying all supplies that might {{be used by the}} Ottoman army. The Ottoman force paraded around the fortress and offered 300,000 aspras (Turkish currency) to those who would open the gate and let the Ottoman army in the fortress without a fight. The heralds proposing these offers went into the fortress at night time and the garrison commanders gave them a splendid dinner, so that they would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the enemy was well prepared for a lengthy siege. After the dinner their offers were rejected and they were sent back to the Sultan. The size of the Ottoman army troubled Skanderbeg because of the effects it could have on the morale of his soldiers and on the local population which supported the princes. Skanderbeg thus moved from village to village, disguised as a common soldier, and invoked the fighting spirit of the population. As a result of this activity, the local chieftains agreed to fight the Ottomans and persuaded Skanderbeg to draw up his plans in concert with theirs.|$|E
500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995).

Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E

2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, was {{favourable}} of 'Gotta Be You', {{referring to}} Austin as [...] " [...] clearly knows where Sugababes' strengths lie", further stating [...] " [...] adds a light, but nonetheless thrilling dusting of monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking to 'Gotta Be You'." [...] He was less favourable about their cover of 'Obsession', stating, [...] "sadly, Sugababes' version sands off the edges rather than amps up the lunacy: what's left is like 1980s night at karaoke". He also remarks that [...] "you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> {{they would be}} happier making R". In conclusion, however, he states that [...] "the album's strike rate is far higher than you might expect from a manufactured pop act's fourth album; it avoids the obvious pitfalls and its highpoints are genuinely high", giving the album 3 out of 5 stars.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss {{stated that}} [...] "No Mercy is largely {{consumed}} with penitence and a looming penitentiary sentence".

I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> {{he could still}} absolutely rip a track to shreds if he could only get himself excited about the prospect. And every so often, No Mercy crackles to life, and we hear flashes of the rap hero Tip could still be". Giving it a 4 out of 10 rating, David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "While peaks and valleys {{can be used in}} a positive sense, the way Tip's offering here dips in and out of quality seems much too violent for most longtime followers to keep up with. There are references to making terrible choices personally, which is fine, but as a musician one assumes a certain responsibility to avoid those professional pitfalls as well". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen cited it as T.I.'s desire for redemption takes on gospel overtones and [...] "Make no mistake, T.I. still knows how to throw a party. No Mercy is a sleek pop-rap record: 14 taut, catchy songs with beats from big-name producers and an array of top-flight guests. No Mercy suggests that, among A-list rappers, T.I. is the one with the most well-honed pop sensibility".|$|E
