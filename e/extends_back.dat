5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E

Since {{the start of the}} Atlantic hurricane database in 1851, there were only eight years in which no tropical cyclone affected the state. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida resulted in at least 6,504 fatalities and monetary damage of over $90million (2008USD). At least 109 boats or ships were either driven ashore, wrecked, or damaged due to the storms.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E

5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that <b>extends</b> <b>back,</b> and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E
5|$|Written {{records of}} premastication {{have been found}} in Ancient Egypt, though the {{practice}} likely <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> into prehistoric times to non-human ancestors. For instance, in the Ancient Egyptian Ebers medical papyrus, a mother was instructed to give a medical remedy to a child through premastication. In the fifth century A.D. Roman culture, premastication of infants' food by caretakers was also common, though the lack of sanitation along with the practice contributed to infant mortality. Infants in Medieval Europe were fed an assortment of mashed, premasticated food or bread softened with liquids.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{the islands}} possibly <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean, which are only found here. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There {{are known to be}} 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably <b>extends</b> <b>back</b> into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E

The reconstructions are based on historical pilot balloon data as well as hourly sea-level pressure (SLP) data from Jakarta, Indonesia. The latter were used to extract the signal of the solar semi-diurnal tide in the middle atmosphere, which is modulated by the QBO. The reconstructions are in good agreement with the QBO signal extracted from historical total ozone data <b>extending</b> <b>back</b> to 1924. Further analyses suggest that the maximum phases of the QBO are captured relatively well after about 1910...|$|R
