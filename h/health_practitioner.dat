40|$|Background: Professional {{collaboration}} between traditional and allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in South Africa is {{proposed in the}} Traditional <b>Health</b> <b>Practitioners</b> Act and could benefit and complement healthcare delivery. Objectives: To explore and describe the collaborative relationship between allopathic and traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> regarding the legalisation of traditional healing, and these health practitioners’ views of their collaborative and professional relationship, as role-players in the healthcare delivery landscape in South Africa. Methods: A qualitative design was followed. The research population comprised 28 participants representing three groups: allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (n = 10), traditionalhealers (n = 14), and traditional healers who are also allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (n = 4). Purposive and snowball sampling was used. Data collection involved unstructured interviews, a focus group interview and modified participant observation. Results: Results indicate both allopathic and traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> experienced negative attitudes towards each other. Mutual understanding (in the form of changing attitudes and communication) was considered crucial to effective {{collaboration between}} these two health systems. Participants made suggestions regarding capacity building. Conclusions: Considering realities of staff shortages and the disease burden in South Africa, facilitating collaboration between allopathic and traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> is recommended. Recommendations {{could be used to}} develop strategies for facilitating professional collaboration between traditional and allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in order to complement healthcare delivery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: People {{who have}} {{limited access to}} dental care may present to non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> for dental {{treatment}} and advice. This review synthesised the available evidence {{regarding the use of}} non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> for oral <b>health</b> problems and the services provided by non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> to manage such presentations. Methods: PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched using key search terms to identify all relevant quantitative and qualitative English-language studies published between 1990 and March 2014. Snowballing techniques were then applied whereby the reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for other relevant citations. Grey literature was searched via Google using the same search terms to identify unpublished work and government reports. Results: Of the 43 papers which met the review criteria, 25 papers reported on the use of non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> for oral <b>health</b> problems and 18 on dental care education and training for non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Four reports were located from the grey literature on the involvement of non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the management of oral health care. Conclusions: The review of literature showed that both children and adults utilise non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> for oral <b>health</b> problems. Despite this, Emergency Department medical staff, medical practitioners and pharmacists generally lacked training and knowledge in the management of oral health. Services from non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> mainly focussed on children. The literature on education and training for non-dental <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> was limited. T.

The objective {{of this research was}} to analyze the correlation between behavior factors of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners,</b> visitation frequency of PMO and case detection rate of TBC. Research was conducted at Karangasem District, Bali. The cacthment area of 12 Health Centers were use as unit analysis of this study. Interview were carried out to 72 private practitioners (doctors, midwives, and nurses) and 12 PMOs of 12 Health Center. Dependent variable was number of case detection rate of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and independent variables were knowledge, attitude, motivation, and visitation frequency of Overseer for Intake of Medication to private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The results show that there were correlation between case detection rate of TBC and good knowledge of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (r = 0. 66), good attitude of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (r = 0. 69), high motivation of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (r = 0. 56), number of private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (r = 0. 13), knowledge of PMO (r = 0. 79), visitation frequency of PMO to private <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> (r = 0, 22).

The study examined the perceptions and experiences of allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> on collaboration with traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in post-apartheid South Africa. Methods: Qualitative descriptive research methodology was used to collect data from allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> employed by Limpopo’s Department of Health.

The title [...] "medical practitioner" [...] is restricted for use by registered medical practitioners, while the title [...] "doctor" [...] is not restricted by law. Despite this, the Medical Board of Australia advises that practitioners who are not medical practitioners who choose to use the title 'Doctor' (or 'Dr') should clearly state their profession in advertisements, even if they hold a PhD or another doctoral degree, e.g. 'Dr Smith (Dentist)' or 'Dr Jones (Chiropodist)'. The Psychology Board of Australia prohibits psychologists from using the title, to avoid confusion with psychiatrists, unless they hold a doctoral degree, in which case they must {{make it clear that}} they are not a medical practitioner or psychiatrist, e.g. by putting '(Psychologist)' after their name. The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) defines doctoral degrees as being at Level 10 of the framework; it specifies that: [...] "Individuals who have been awarded a Doctoral Degree at Level 10 on the AQF are entitled to use the title 'Doctor'. The title 'Doctor' will not be used by those who hold an honorary award."

Participatory action research design was used. The study was conducted in three phases following the decision taken by the stakeholders during the consultative meetings. The first phase involved the training of 437 traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> on HIV/AIDS and TB diseases, and also assessed their knowledge levels, beliefs and practices about the HIV/AIDS and TB. The HIV/AIDS and TB training workshops prepared the traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> for group discussions with number of allopathic <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the second phase. The second phase explored their perceptions and experiences of collaboration in the management of HIV/AIDS and TB patients, identified strategies for collaboration. The findings confirmed that collaboration was long overdue, and it created an opportunity to build relationship to address challenges of patients secrecy, treatment overdose and abandonment of ARV treatment. They explored how they could work together in the fight against HIV/AIDS and TB infections. Change of mindset through the decolonization process was decided as the best suitable approach moving forward. Based on the findings of phases one and two, the third phase, which is a COHORT model for collaboration between allopathic and traditional <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the management of HIV/AIDS and TB patients was developed and described.
