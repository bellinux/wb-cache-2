This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common yellowthroat were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E

25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
50|$|This species appears remarkably big-headed, {{especially}} if it puffs up the small crest. Its plumage is gray-brown above. It has a white throat, dirty gray breast and buffish underparts which become whiter during the breeding season. Two indistinct buff bars are present on each wing. Its lack of an eye ring and wingbars, and its all dark bill distinguish it from other North American tyrant flycatchers, and it pumps its tail {{up and down like}} other phoebes when perching on a branch. The <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe's</b> call is a sharp chip, and the song, from which it gets its name, is fee-bee.|$|R

50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> (Sayornis phoebe) is similar, {{particularly}} in the worn plumage after breeding. It always lacks clearly defined wingbars, however, and bobs its tail frequently. It has a shorter primary projection. The <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> is also present on the breeding grounds by March, while eastern wood pewees don't arrive until very late April and early May. The songs (fee-bee, fee-bee) and calls (chip) are quite different.|$|E
50|$|Eight {{species of}} birds live in the {{vicinity}} of Sechler Run. These species are broad-winged hawk, northern flicker, red-winged blackbird, American goldfinch, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> song sparrow, gray catbird, and house wren.|$|E
50|$|Rare {{and unusual}} birds {{that have been}} seen in the area include: {{northern}} parula (fall 2012), red-naped and red-breasted hybrid sapsucker (fall 2012), <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> (fall 2012), summer tanagers (November 2012).|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> is open woodland, farmland and suburbs, often near water. This phoebe is insectivorous, and often perches conspicuously when seeking food items. It also eats {{fruits and berries}} in cooler weather.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the more}} rare species which have {{been seen in the}} Preserve include black hawk, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> green kingfisher, Harris's hawk, Lawrence's goldfinch, {{magnolia}} warbler, Mississippi kite, pyrrholuxia, rufous-backed robin, winter wren, yellow-billed cuckoo, and zone-tailed hawk.|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is similar}} to the <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe.</b> It sallies from a perch to catch insects in mid-air. It also hovers American kestrel-like and dips its tail while perched. The Say's phoebe also likes to feed just above the water's surface. They eat insects almost exclusively, but have been known to eat berries.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> (Sayornis phoebe) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. The genus name Sayornis {{is constructed}} from the specific part of Charles Lucien Bonaparte's name for Say's phoebe, Muscicapa saya, and Ancient Greek ornis, [...] "bird". Phoebe is an alternative name for the Roman moon-goddess Diana, {{but it may also}} have been chosen to imitate the bird's call.|$|E
50|$|The eastern wood pewee (Contopus virens) is {{extremely}} similar in appearance. It lacks the buff hue usually {{present on the}} lighter parts of the eastern phoebe's plumage, and thus has always clearly defined and contrasting wing-bars. It also does not bob its tail habitually, and appears on the breeding grounds much later though it leaves for winter quarters {{at about the same}} time as the <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe.</b>|$|E
50|$|It often nests {{on human}} {{structures}} such as bridges and buildings. Nesting activity may start {{as early as the}} first days of April. The nest is an open cup with a mud base and lined with moss and grass, built in crevice in a rock or man-made site; two to six eggs are laid. Both parents feed the young and usually raise two broods per year. The <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> is occasionally host to the nest-parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater).|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} birds have been {{observed}} nesting in the park including prothonotary warbler, bluebird, Cooper's hawk, red-shouldered hawk, American robin, mourning dove, black-capped chickadee, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> red-headed woodpecker, Canada goose, yellow-crowned night heron, indigo bunting, and cliff swallow, among others. In 2011, an American bald eagle attempted to nest at the park but was unsuccessful and relocated to an unknown location. Prothonotary warblers nest along the Shoal Creek corridor and monitoring takes place though annual counts. Annual bird counts are held {{in the spring and}} winter to document numbers and types of bird species located in the area.|$|E

50|$|It is migratory, {{wintering}} in {{the southernmost}} United States and Central America. It {{is a very}} rare vagrant to western Europe. This {{is one of the}} first birds to return to the breeding grounds in spring and one of the last to leave in the fall. They arrive for breeding in mid-late March, but they return to winter quarters around the same time when other migrant songbirds do, in September and early October; migration times have stayed the same in the last 100 years. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a western range expansion of the <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> as well as range expansions of many other species of birds.|$|E
50|$|Over 200 {{species of}} both migratory and {{non-migratory}} birds {{have been identified}} in the marsh. It serves as a wintering ground and stop-over point for migrating waterfowl, which gather in numbers as high as 4,000 in the fall. These waterfowl include American black ducks, wood ducks, and mallards. Constitution Marsh is also used by migrating pied-billed grebes, ospreys, northern harriers, and peregrine falcons; at least 2 and as many as 30 bald eagles can be found there in the winter. Autumn concentrations of swallows once peaked at 100,000, but have dwindled since the mid-1990s. Over 50 different bird species are known to breed within the wildlife sanctuary, including the least bittern, worm-eating warbler, Virginia rail, Louisiana waterthrush, northern cardinal, spotted sandpiper, gray catbird, common yellowthroat, marsh wren, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> swamp sparrow, and willow flycatcher, as well as the wood thrush, which breeds in the forest near the swamp. The marsh was included in bird habitat studies in 1986-1987 and again in 2005. The results revealed that the diversity of breeding bird species is steadily decreasing as the red-winged blackbird becomes dominant.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{species of}} birds {{can be found on}} Gildersleeve mountain. Barred owls are common year round {{residents}} and can be found by listening and watching carefully. They will often sit close to the trials in clear view but hidden {{in the shadows of the}} branches. Most visitors are oblivious to their presence. Cooper's hawks, red-shouldered hawks, broad-winged hawks and red-tailed hawks also nest on the slopes. Wild turkey nests here. The spectacular pileated woodpecker, as well as hairy, downy, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common year round. Great creasted flycatcher, <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> eastern wood pewee and Acadian flycatcher are common nesters. Eastern bluebird is common in the more open areas, wood thrush is found nesting wherever trees create a canopy overhead. Black-capped chickadees, tufted titmice, white-breasted nuthatch are common residents and red-breasted nuthatch is sometimes found. Red-eyed vireos are common tree top nesters. Hooded warbler and American redstart are common nesters in the forest under story. Ovenbird, nests on the forest floor and Louisiana waterthrush nest is the ravines and creek beds. Eastern towhee is found in the underbrush. Scarlet tanager, rose-breasted grosbeak, American goldfinch, house finch, and song sparrow are also common nesters ...|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} lack {{of trees}} in the Great Plains acted {{as a barrier to}} the range expansion and recent increases in forests broke down this barrier. Increases in forest distribution along the Missouri River and its tributaries provided barred owls with sufficient foraging habitat, protection from the weather, and concealment from avian predators to allow barred owls to move westward. Decades later, increases in forests in the northern Great Plains allowed them to connect their eastern and western distributions across southern Canada. These increases in forests were caused by European-American settlers via their exclusion of fires historically set by Native Americans, by their suppression of accidental fires and by increased tree-planting; to a lesser degree this regional net forest increase was also caused by these settlers' extirpating bison (Bison bison) and by overhunting elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus spp.) and, in some areas, by extirpating beaver (Castor canadensis) and replacing native ungulates with livestock. Increase in trees in the Great Plains from fire suppression or tree planting is considered a main cause of the range expansions of many other species of birds including western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis), <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe</b> (Sayornis phoebe), eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchus).|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{strategies}} in birds {{are much more}} complex than previously imagined. In this study, I examined three different aspects of reproduction in a migrant passerine, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> (Sayornis phoebe). I investigated the temporal and energetic variation in reproductive effort (clutch size) and nesting success (numbers of eggs hatched, numbers of young fledged, and proportions of young fledged) according to female nesting type and brood number, the level of breeding site (territory and nest) fidelity and mate fidelity within and between years, and the presence and frequency of extra-pair young in first and second brood nests. I also developed a suite of 5 <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> microsatellite loci for use in molecular genetic analyses. ^ Eastern Phoebes in this study had extremely high nesting success. Although clutch size ranged from 2 to 6 eggs, little variation was observed and 93 % of all nests had complete clutches of 4 or 5 eggs. Nests initiated in the early season had significantly larger clutches and fledged more young than nests initiated in the late season. Late-season, 1 -brooded females laid the smallest mean first brood clutch of all female types. Declines in clutch size and numbers of young fledged {{were found between the}} first and second broods of 2 -brooded females but not between consecutive clutches laid by renest females. Breeding site (i. e. territory and nest) and mate fidelity were extremely high both within and between years. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> adults rarely dispersed to new territories, but after an initial nest failure, they were more likely to change nests within a territory for their second breeding attempt. Males were more likely to change territories between years; however, the distance dispersed between territories did not differ between the sexes. Divorce was uncommon and not influenced by gender or previous reproductive success. Although the majority of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> pairs were both socially and genetically monogamous within a breeding season, 17. 2 % of all families had extra-pair young in at least one brood and I found 2 instances of apparent intraspecific brood parasitism. I also discovered that second broods were more likely to contain EPY than first broods. ...|$|E

40|$|Vocal {{learning}} has evolved {{in only a}} few groups of mammals and birds. The key neuroanatomical and behavioural links bridging vocal learners and non-learners are still unknown. Here we show that a non-vocal-learning suboscine, the <b>eastern</b> <b>phoebe,</b> expresses neural and behavioural substrates that are associated with vocal learning in closely related oscine songbirds. In phoebes, a specialized forebrain region in the intermediate arcopallium seems homologous to the oscine song nucleus RA (robust nucleus of arcopallium) by its neural connections, expression of glutamate receptors and singing-dependent immediate-early gene expression. Lesion of this RA-like region induces subtle but consistent song changes. Moreover, the unlearned phoebe song unexpectedly develops through a protracted ontogeny. These features provide the first evidence of forebrain vocal-motor control in suboscines, which has not been encountered in other avian non-vocal-learners, and offer a potential configuration of brain and behaviour from which vocal learning might have evolved...|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} southern Indiana <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> (Sayornis phoebe) reproductive {{responses to}} the emergence of Brood X of the 17 -year periodical cicada (Magicada septendecim, M. cassini, and M. septendcula) in 2004 (cicada year) and compared results with a period of more typical food abundance in 2005 (non-cicada year). A periodical cicada emergence produces a superabundant pulse of protein-rich, highly palatable prey with limited predator avoidance tactics. Typically double-brooded, phoebes often lay smaller late-season clutches about 2 -weeks after the fledging of early-season broods. The unlimited prey base was available during the early-season nestling and fledgling phases, and throughout late-season egg laying, incubation, and brood rearing in 2004. During the cicada emergence, phoebes more rapidly initiated late-season clutches (intra-clutch interval: 44 ± 2 days vs. 50 ± 4 days; p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Late-season clutches in the cicada year were larger than typical (4. 85 eggs vs. 4. 45; p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), and resulted in more young fledging than in the non-cicada year (3. 66 fledglings vs. 3. 14; p = 0. 0291).

40|$|In theory, obligate brood {{parasitic}} {{birds are}} freed from {{several of the}} temporal and spatial constraints of parental care for dependent young. Yet, similar to parental bird species, adults in several avian brood parasites show a territorial spacing system while breeding, including site fidelity within and across years. Banding-based capture and sighting studies are also suggestive of non-parasite-like lower levels of natal philopatry in avian brood parasites. We analyzed the potential correlation of physical distance with genetic structure of a Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater population, sampling parasitic chicks from nests across different temporal and spatial scales of its common host, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Phoebe</b> Sayornis phoebe, near Ithaca, New York, USA. In support of extensive breeding but not historical patterns of natal philopatry, we detected no significant covariation of genetic similarity by distance of nestling parasites at the scale beyond that of individual host nest sites. These results contribute towards a baseline for future behavioral and genetic comparisons of whether and how parasitic versus parental reproductive strategies impact patterns of avian population genetic structure across space and time.
