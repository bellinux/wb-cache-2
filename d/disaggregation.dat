5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender <b>disaggregation,</b> the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, {{and the creation of a}} two-sector system.|$|E
5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender <b>disaggregation</b> strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2007 Dos Santos e Pires (2007, henceforth DS&P) reported estimates close to minus one for the (gross, aggregate, long run) tax rate semi elasticity of Brazilian private investment in the post-Real Plan period. This paper has two basic goals, i. e. i) to revise DS&P´s data and econometric estimates {{in light of the}} newest official national accounts data (which were made available in March, 28, 2007); and, given that there are good reasons to suspect that different kinds of taxes affect private decisions differently, ii) to extend DS&P´s analysis investigating also the impact of different <b>disaggregations</b> of the gross aggregate tax rate on the Brazilian private investment in the 1995 - 2006 period. The main results reported here are that the new data do not seem compatible with DS&P´s previous finding and that precise new estimates are difficult to obtain in light of the evidence of strong structural breaks within our sample and of the existence of two cointegrating relationships (and, hence, of the difficulties associated with identifying cointegrating vectors). Compatible results were obtained also {{with the use of the}} three most important <b>disaggregations</b> of the gross tax rate. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to formalize, within a broad range of {{theories}} of imprecise probabilities, the notion of a total, aggregate measure of uncertainty and its various <b>disaggregations</b> into measures of nonspecificity and conflict. As a framework for facilitating this aim, we introduce a system of well-justified axiomatic requirements for such measures. It is shown that these requirements can be equivalently defined for belief functions and credal sets. Some important consequences are then derived within this framework, which clarify the role of various uncertainty measures proposed in the literature. Moreover, some well-defined new open problems for future research also emerge from the introduced framework...|$|R

One refers to the breakdown into price indexes corresponding to big groups of markets throughout the European countries and another considers the HICP by countries. Both <b>disaggregations</b> are of interest because in each one, the component prices are not fully cointegrated, having more than one common factor in their trends. The paper shows that the breakdown by group of markets improves the European inflation forecasts and constitutes a framework in which general and specific indicators can be introduced for further improvement...|$|R

This paper estimates an industrial energy demand model for the province of Ontario using a linear-logit specification for fuel type equations which are embedded in an aggregate energy demand equation. Short term, long-term, own- and cross-price elasticities are estimated for electricity, natural gas, oil and coal. Own- and cross-price elasticities are disaggregated to show the overall price elasticities and the "energy-constant" price elasticities when aggregate energy use is held unchanged. These <b>disaggregations</b> suggest that a substantial part of energy conservation comes from the higher aggregate price of energy and not from interfuel substitution. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{outlines}} the steps undertaken {{to develop a}} dynamic land use transport model. The model is based around an existing transport modelling suite, called START, which {{has been applied to}} many urban areas in the UK and abroad. However, its integration with an explicit land use model (called DELTA) was new, and this paper describes the first implementation of the combined dynamic land use transport model for the study area of Fife and Lothian region. The model was used in a PhD thesis and an EPSRC ‘Sustainable Cities’ research project at the Institute for Transport Studies. The paper discusses the processes involved in the full implementation of this model, involving both software development, modification to existing software, and implementation. However, it focuses in particular upon the data requirements and calibration of the various submodels in DELTA. In general the model dataset has been generated using existing study area data from past START applications, plus data from the 1991 Census of population and employment. Not all the <b>disaggregations</b> of data required by the model were available from published, or on-line, sources, and so several <b>disaggregations</b> were undertaken. A feature of the model is that the calibration is undertaken for each submodel individually. In general, the model made use of past research into the relationships that it represents, combined with the judgement of the model developers where no other data was available. The implementation of the location model is discussed in detail, including the use of environmental variables in location choice. This fulfils the main aim of this paper; to provide the technical background for the research projects that make use of this model implementation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to test the Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) {{productivity}} (TFP) catch-up framework on European regions. Differences in the stock of human capital across regions are hypothesized to {{be the cause of}} differences in the speed by which follower regions converge and catch-up with the technology frontier. We find robust empirical evidence for this hypothesis. Also, we find evidence of complementarities between R&D expenditures and human capital accumulation for which R&D impacts TFP growth as long as a critical mass for the stock of human capital is reached. The results are robust to sectoral <b>disaggregations</b> and to the choice of a country or sectoral specific leader in the TFP gap computation and to control for spatial dependence across European regions. ...|$|R

This method, in contrast to most current approaches, pays due regards both to potential output and to the productivity of capital. From an initial OCM benchmark estimate, we produce series for the net capital stock, via a perpetual inventory method (PIM), for all China and some useful regional <b>disaggregations</b> over the 45 -year period 1960 - 2005. As a by-product, we also make available the optimal productivities of incremental or "marginal" capital, corresponding to the net accumulated GFCF over 5 -year sub-periods from 1960 onwards. We then attempt some structural analysis, showing that the quantity of resources rather than their quality appears to be largely behind growth rates, especially since the 1990 s.

40|$|The basic {{question}} we raise {{in this paper}} is whether the 2013 Discussion Paper (DP 2013) on the Conceptual Framework provides adequate principles for reporting an entity’s performance and what improvements could be made in light of both user needs and evidence from academic literature. DP 2013 proposes to continue applying a balance sheet approach to financial accounting, whereby the income statement serves as a statement explaining changes in an entity’s financial position. Performance is reduced {{to a discussion of}} possible approaches to defining other comprehensive income (OCI) items and recycling. We conclude that the literature supports a more refined approach to communicating relevant attributes of performance, defining performance independently from assets and liabilities and taking into account various relevant <b>disaggregations</b> within profit or loss. We therefore propose a more balanced approach to financial reporting whereby the balance sheet and income statement are treated as equally important and the income statement gives more information about various relevant attributes of performance...|$|R

In particular, in the median product, the share of the top five firms in total exports is 91 %. In panel (b), we define products at the chapter level. Since products are much more aggregated in this classification, the share of the top five firms in total exports is reduced significantly. In the median chapter, the share of the top five firms is 38 %. We also observe a larger heterogeneity across chapters. For example, the share of chapters where the top five firms account for between 10 and 20 % of exports is similar to the share of chapters where the top five firms account for between 40 and 50 % of exports. The concentration is even lower for sections (panel (c)), where the top five firms account for 25 % of exports in the median section.|$|R
