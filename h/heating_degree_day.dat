40|$|This study {{investigates the}} urban heat island {{characteristics}} of four major areas of Hong Kong. The {{areas of study}} include a densely populated and well-developed commercial area (i. e., Tsim Sha Tsui) and three suburban areas (i. e., Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Sha Tin) with differing degrees of development. The weather station data of respective areas were acquired from the Hong Kong Observatory. The urban heat island intensity, determined as the air-temperature difference between the selected urban/suburban area and the reference rural area (i. e., Ta Kuw Ling) with thin population and lush vegetation, {{was used for the}} analysis. Results showed stronger heat island effect during winter and nighttime than during summer and daytime. An investigation of the cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> indicate that all areas have observed higher number of cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days.</b> However, the cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> were the maximum while <b>heating</b> <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> were the minimum in the urban area (i. e., Tsim Sha Tsui).

50|$|The {{industry}} has recognized {{that in many}} circumstances it may be impractical to design and build building assemblies which never get wet. Good design and practice involve controlling the wetting of building assemblies from both the exterior and interior. So, the use of vapor barrier {{should be taken into}} consideration. Their use has already been legislated within the building code of some countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland & Wales). How, where, and whether a vapor barrier (vapor diffusion retarder) should be used depends on the climate. Typically, the number of heating degree days (HDD) in an area is used to help make these determinations. A <b>heating</b> <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> is a unit that measures how often outdoor daily dry-bulb temperatures fall below an assumed base, normally 18°C (65°F). For building in most parts of North America, where winter heating conditions predominate, vapor barrier are placed toward the interior, heated side of insulation in the assembly. In humid regions where warm-weather cooling predominates within buildings, the vapor barrier should be located toward the exterior side of insulation. In relatively mild or balanced climates, or where assemblies are designed to minimize condensation conditions, a vapor barrier may not be necessary at all.|$|E

40|$|Purpose–The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{feasible}} model for the daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, in order to price temperature-based weather derivatives; also to derive analytical approximation formulas for the sensitivities of these contracts. Design/methodology/approach–This study proposes a seasonal volatility model that estimates daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen using the mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It then uses the analytical approximation and Monte Carlo methods to price <b>heating</b> <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> and cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> options for these cities. In addition, it derives and calculates the option sensitivities on the basis of an analytical approximation formula. Findings–There exists a strong seasonality in the volatility of daily average temperatures of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. To model the seasonality Fourier approximation is applied to the squared volatility of daily temperatures. The analytical approximation formulas and Monte Carlo simulation produce very similar prices for heating/cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> options in Beijing and Shanghai, a result that also verifies the convergence of the Monte Carlo and approximation estimators.

40|$|This article reviews six {{different}} temperature forecasting models {{proposed by the}} prior literature for pricing weather derivatives. Simulation of these models is used to estimate daily temperature and, as a consequence, the metrics used for pricing temperature derivatives. The models that rely on an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) process exhibit a better goodness-of-fit than those that are established under Monte Carlo simulations. However, the superiority of ARMA-type models is not reflected over the forecast horizon. Over that period, the models which rely on Monte Carlo simulations exhibit a tendency to over-forecast the monthly-accumulated <b>Heating</b> <b>Degree</b> <b>Day</b> (AccHDD) index and to under-forecast the monthly-accumulated Cooling Degree Day (AccCDD) index. Alternatively, models established under the ARMA approach both under-forecast and overforecast the monthly accumulated indices. All models consistently over-forecast the average daily temperature. The most appropriate pricing model varies between cities and months. Finally, the models {{examined in this study}} generate a more accurate AccHDD futures price than the price traded on the market. However, the ability of these models to estimate the AccCDD futures price is significantly poorer than that of the market. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, many tools have been {{developed}} to support design decisions related to energy efficient buildings. However, these energy simulation tools are complex and require too detailed input data to be appropriate for use in the sketch design stage.

This paper proposes a simple tool to estimate the energy consumption in the sketch design stage which can, in a later design stage, be linked to a dynamic simulation tool. Furthermore, this study proposes the use of visualisation methods by architects to improve the integration of energy simulations in the sketch design stage. The proposed simple energy estimation tool is based on the " dynamic Equivalent <b>Heating</b> <b>Degree</b> <b>Day</b> Method (dynamic EHDD) ". Relevant sketch design parameters identified are thermal compactness, insulation level, effective use of direct and indirect solar gains, internal gains including occupant presence and activities, and ventilation strategies.

25|$|This {{approach}} requires building {{a model of}} the underlying index, i.e. the one upon which the derivative value is determined (for example monthly/seasonal cumulative <b>heating</b> <b>degree</b> <b>days).</b> The simplest way to model the index is just to model the distribution of historical index outcomes.

The predictive power of such a model is rather limited. A better result can be obtained by modelling the index generating process on a finer scale. In the case of temperature contracts, {{a model of the}} daily average (or min and max) temperature time series can be built. The daily temperature (or rain, snow, wind, etc.) model can be built using common statistical time series models (i.e. ARMA or Fourier transform in the frequency domain) purely based only on the features displayed in the historical time series of the index.
