40|$|Objective: Nitrogen {{losses from}} manure, {{especially}} from cattle slurry, significantly {{contribute to the}} eutrophication problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to minimize the nitrogen losses from cattle slurry used as a fertilizer of winter wheat. Investigation programme: In multi-factorial field experiments and accompanying laboratory studies techniques for the careful incorporation of slurry were tested together with slurry separation and slurry additives. Results, possible applications: A rapid pH increase due to CO_ 2 volatilization following slurry application is the cause of the high initial NH_ 3 emission rates. To conserve slurry nitrogen, the slurry-borne bases have to be buffered by the acid content of the soil. Only the combination of slurry separation and incorporation (<b>flexible</b> <b>harrow,</b> injector) provides sufficient contact between slurry and soil to reduce NH_ 3 losses to less than 30 % of the ammoniacal slurry nitrogen in all the weather and soil conditions investigated. Banded application of slurry to growing crops (winter wheat) by trail hoses with subsequent careful incorporation by a <b>flexible</b> <b>harrow</b> seems to be the best way to use the slurry as a fertilizer in cereal production. The use of trail hoses allone is not sufficient. Viscous slurry with a high dry matter content may only be used in a N-conserving manner after it has been dry matter-reduced by separation. Possibly the addition of ground gypsum to slurry previous to the application can further reduce the NH_ 3 losses. (orig.)

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} actions of weeding with a spring-tine harrow at different tine settings {{is necessary to}} achieve optimal weed control. The mechanical actions of a tine harrow in two different soils at two different locations on the harrow were investigated, pointing out the effects of varied implement settings and operational conditions on the tine weeding performance. A commercially available <b>flexible</b> <b>harrow</b> tine was investigated in sandy and sandy clay loam soils. The tine was pulled in soil bins without plants {{in order to avoid}} biological variances. Tine movements and forces acting on the tine were measured with strain gauges and analysed as the mean backward and upward tine torsion, the variation of the tine location around the mean position in sideward and upward direction and the properties of the vibrational frequency in sideward and upward direction during working. In addition, a high-speed camera was used to provide visible description of tine mechanical actions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} action of a <b>flexible</b> weed <b>harrow</b> spring-tine during post-emergence selective treatment was evaluated in different soil textures and properties, and for different tine locations. The tine movements and forces {{acting on the}} tine were measured with strain gauges and analysed as mean tine torsion in the soil, the flexural variation of the tine top position and {{the properties of the}} vibration frequency during cultivation. In addition. a high-speed camera provided a visible description of the tine penetrating the soil. Experiments were conducted indoors in soil bins to reduce external influences. No plants were involved in the experiments in order to avoid biological variances. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The false seedbed {{technique}} {{reduces the}} weed seed {{bank in the}} topsoil and, as a result, significantly reduces competition of annual weeds in the succeeding crop. 	 •	Prepare a regular seedbed 2 to 4 weeks before the planned seeding date of the next crop. •	Let the weeds germinate and grow to the 2 - to 4 -leaf stage, the most effective stage for weed control. •	Uproot the weeds {{to a depth of}} 3 to 5 cm using a harrow comb or a <b>flexible</b> or chain <b>harrow.</b> •	If (a) weed density is high, (b) if you have 7 to 10 days available for sowing the crop, or if (c) weed competition in the following crop is very critical, repeat the procedure a second time before sowing the crop as usual. Notes •	Weed seed germination is highest in humid soil with a fine tilth. If the seedbed is too dry or cloddy, germination is reduced and the impact of the method is limited. •	Effectiveness of the method can be limited at soil temperatures below 10 °C. •	Preferably use a power take-off or friction-driven machines to avoid soil structure damages...|$|R
