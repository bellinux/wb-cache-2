40|$|An {{algorithm}} is developed {{to control a}} pulsed {Delta}V thruster on a small satellite {{to allow it to}} fly in formation with a host satellite undergoing time dependent atmospheric drag deceleration. The algorithm uses four short thrusts per orbit to correct for differences in the average radii of the satellites due to differences in drag and one thrust to symmetrize the orbits. The radial difference between the orbits is the only input to the algorithm. The algorithm automatically stabilizes the orbits after ejection and includes provisions to allow azimuthal positional changes by modifying the drag compensation pulses. The algorithm gives radial and azimuthal <b>deadbands</b> of 50 cm and 3 m for a radial measurement accuracy of {+-} 5 cm and {+-} 60 % period variation in the drag coefficient of the host. Approaches to further reduce the <b>deadbands</b> are described. The methodology of establishing a stable orbit after ejection is illustrated in an appendix. The results show the optimum ejection angle to minimize stabilization thrust is upward at 86 {sup o} from the orbital velocity. At this angle the stabilization velocity that must be supplied by the thruster is half the ejection velocity. An ejection velocity of 0. 02 m/sat 86 {sup o} gives an azimuthal separation after ejection and orbit stabilization of 187 m. A description of liquid based gas thrusters suitable for the satellite control is included in an appendix...|$|R
50|$|In most {{applications}} of on-off feedback control, some consideration {{needs to be}} given to other costs, such as wear and tear of control valves and perhaps other start-up costs when power is reapplied each time the PV drops. Therefore, practical on-off control systems are designed to include hysteresis which acts as a <b>deadband,</b> a region around the setpoint value in which no control action occurs. The width of <b>deadband</b> may be adjustable or programmable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deadband</b> is {{different}} from hysteresis. With hysteresis there is no dead zone, and so the output is always in one direction or another.

Especially for compression applications, the dead-zone may be given a different width than that for the other steps.

5000|$|External {{pitch control}} does not {{pass through the}} glide circuit, nor is it {{presented}} to the VCF tracking switches [...] - [...] the external inputs were not designed for external keyboard control. The lowest note played on the keyboard determines the pitch, a condition that {{is referred to as}} low-note priority. The envelope generators do not re-trigger unless all notes are lifted before the next note is played, an important characteristic which allows phrasing. The modulation and pitch-bending wheels were an innovation that many instrumentalists found to be extremely playable. The pitch-bend wheel is on the left of the modulation wheel. It is normally kept in the centered position. It is not spring-loaded; the player must return it to the centered position to play in tune. There is a delicate detent mechanism to help the player find the center position tactually. In sharp contrast to later synthesizers that also have pitch-bend wheels, there is no <b>deadband</b> {{near the center of the}} wheel's travel; the wheel produces minute changes in pitch no matter how slightly it is moved in either direction. The wheel can therefore be used to introduce slight vibrato or nuance, as well as accurate pitch changes. However, Moog later recommended adding a <b>deadband</b> mod and published this mod in their factory service notes. The detent mechanism can be adjusted somewhat in its strength.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{feedback}} {{around a}} discontinuous (but piecewise continuous) nonlinearity (e.g., an amplifier with saturation, or an element with <b>deadband</b> effects) cascaded {{with a slow}} stable linear system. Depending on the amplitude of {{the output of the}} linear system, the feedback presented to the nonlinearity will be in a different continuous region. As the output of the linear system decays, the nonlinearity may move into a different continuous region. This switching from one continuous region to another can generate periodic oscillations. The describing function method attempts to predict characteristics of those oscillations (e.g., their fundamental frequency) by assuming that the slow system acts like a low-pass or bandpass filter that concentrates all energy around a single frequency. Even if the output waveform has several modes, the method can still provide intuition about properties like frequency and possibly amplitude; in this case, the describing function method {{can be thought of as}} describing the sliding mode of the feedback system.|$|E
40|$|Recent entry {{guidance}} algorithm development 123 {{has tended}} to focus on numerical integration of trajectories onboard in order to evaluate candidate bank profiles. Such methods enjoy benefits such as flexibility to varying mission profiles and improved robustness to large dispersions. A common element across many of these modern entry guidance algorithms is a reliance upon the concept of Apollo heritage lateral error (or azimuth error) <b>deadbands</b> in which the number of bank reversals to be performed is non-deterministic. This paper presents a closed-loop bank reversal method that operates with a fixed number of bank reversals defined prior to flight. However, this number of bank reversals can be modified at any point, including in flight, based on contingencies such as fuel leaks where propellant usage must be minimized...|$|R

5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, backlash, {{sometimes called}} lash or play, is a clearance or lost motion in a mechanism caused by {{gaps between the}} parts. It {{can be defined as}} [...] "the maximum distance or angle through which any part of a mechanical system may be moved in one direction without applying appreciable force or motion to the next part in mechanical sequence",p. 1-8 and is a mechanical form of <b>deadband.</b> An example, in the context of gears and gear trains, is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth. It can be seen when the direction of movement is reversed and the slack or lost motion is taken up before the reversal of motion is complete. It can be heard from the railway couplings when a train reverses direction. Another example is in a valve train with mechanical tappets, where a certain range of lash is necessary for the valves to work properly.|$|E

Relationship between network status and NCS status is solved with a TCP-friendly transport flow control protocol and the <b>deadband</b> concept, relating <b>deadband</b> value and transmission throughput.

40|$|The 2050 targets {{established}} by the EU will foster both larger penetration of renewable energy, especially wind power, and more cross–border interconnections. Moreover, this new framework requires the non-conventional power sources and power converter-based systems {{to be responsible for}} the duties traditionally carried out by conventional synchronous generators as frequency support.

40|$|A {{computer}} program implements a thrust impulse measurement (TIM) filter, which processes data {{on changes in}} velocity and attitude of a spacecraft to estimate the small impulsive forces and torques exerted by the thrusters of the spacecraft reaction control system (RCS). The velocity-change data are obtained from line-of-sight-velocity data from Doppler measurements made from the Earth. The attitude-change data are the telemetered from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) aboard the spacecraft. The TIM filter estimates the threeaxis thrust vector for each RCS thruster, thereby enabling reduction of cumulative navigation error attributable to inaccurate prediction of thrust vectors. The filter has been augmented with a simple mathematical model to compensate for large temperature fluctuations in the spacecraft thruster catalyst bed in order to estimate thrust more accurately at <b>deadbanding</b> cold-firing levels. Also, rigorous consider-covariance estimation is applied in the TIM {{to account for the}} expected uncertainty in the moment of inertia and the location of the center of gravity of the spacecraft. The TIM filter was built with, and depends upon, a sigma-point consider-filter algorithm implemented in a Python-language {{computer program}}...|$|R
40|$|A generic {{model of}} a turbopump, {{simplified}} to bring out these effects is examined. This model demonstrates that bearing <b>deadbands</b> which are of the same order of magnitude or larger than the center-of-mass offset of a rotor due to mass imbalances cause significantly different dynamic behavior than would be expected of a linear, dynamical system. This fundamentally nonlinear behavior yields altered stability characteristics and altered bearing loading tendencies. It is shown that side forces can enhance system stability in the small, i. e., {{as long as the}} mass imbalance does not exceed some thresholds value or as long as no large, impulsive disturbances cause the motion to depart significantly from the region of stability. Limit cycles are investigated in this report and techniques for determining these limit cycles are developed. These limit cycles are the major source of bearing loading and appear in both synchronous and nonsynchronous forms. The synchronous limit cycles are driven by rotor imbalances. The nonsynchronous limit cycles (also called subsynchronous whirls) are self-excited and are the sources of instability...|$|R
