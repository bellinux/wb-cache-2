25|$|Le Corbusier was {{commissioned}} by Philips to present a pavilion at the 1958 World Fair and insisted (against the sponsors' resistance) on working with Varèse, who developed his Poème <b>électronique</b> for the venue, where it was heard by an estimated two million people. Using 400 speakers separated throughout the interior, Varèse created a sound and space installation geared towards experiencing sound as it moves through space. Received with mixed reviews, this piece challenged audience expectations and traditional means of composing, breathing life into electronic synthesis and presentation.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Cologne {{he began to}} write electronic music alongside Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig at the electronic studio of West German Radio (WDR). He completed only two works in this medium, however—the pieces Glissandi (1957) and Artikulation (1958)—before returning to instrumental music. A third work, originally entitled Atmosphères but later known as Pièce <b>électronique</b> Nr. 3, was planned, but the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely. It was finally realised in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the Institute of Sonology.|$|E

Subjects for which the Brevet de Technicien may be offered include Batiment (Building Construction), <b>Electronique</b> (Electronics), Electrotechnique (Electrotechnics), Frabication Mechanique (Maintenance and Production Mechanics), and Mecanique Automobile (Automobile Mechanics). The Brevet de Technicien is the Diploma qualification offered by the Lycée Polytechnique in Mauritius.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1957, Kid Baltan (Dick Raaymakers) and Tom Dissevelt {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Song Of The Second Moon, recorded at the Philips studio. The public remained {{interested in the}} new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Varèse's Poème <b>électronique,</b> which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 Brussels World Fair. That same year, Mauricio Kagel, an Argentine composer, composed Transición II. The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on a piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.|$|E
500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 1950s, Farmer {{featured}} in recordings by leading arrangers of the day, including George Russell, Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson, being in demand because of his reputation for being able to play anything. The wide range of styles these arrangers represented was extended when Farmer took part in a series of experimental sessions with composer Edgard Varèse in 1957. Varèse used approximate notation and wanted the musicians to improvise within its structure; {{at least some of the}} seasoned jazz musicians present regarded this process of creation as similar to their own familiar creations of spontaneously produced head arrangements, but their efforts influenced Varèse's composition, Poème <b>électronique.</b> Farmer's playing around this time is summarized by critic Whitney Balliett, commenting on his performance on Hal McKusick's 1957 album Hal McKusick Quintet: [...] "Farmer has become one of the few genuinely individual modern trumpeters. (Nine out of ten modern trumpeters are true copies of Dizzy Gillespie or Miles Davis.)" [...] Farmer was one of 57 jazz musicians to appear in the 1958 photograph [...] "A Great Day in Harlem" [...] and was later interviewed for the 1994 documentary of the same title.|$|E

500|$|George Martin, {{along with}} Brian Wilson, is {{generally}} credited with helping to popularise {{the idea of}} the recording studio as a musical instrument which could then be used to aid the process of composition. In MacFarlane's opinion, Sgt. Pepper most important musical innovation is its [...] "integration of recording technology into the compositional process". He credits Edgard Varèse's Poème <b>électronique</b> as the piece of music that made this advance feasible, by [...] "expand the definition of sound recording from archival documentation to the reification of the musical canvass"; he identifies [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] as the Sgt. Pepper track that best exemplifies this approach. Although early analogue synthesisers were available – Robert Moog was working on the second generation of the first commercially available keyboard around {{the same time as the}} Sgt. Pepper recording sessions – none were used during the album's recording, which relied solely on electric and acoustic instruments and field recordings that were available at Abbey Road Studios. The musician and producer Alan Parsons believes that with Sgt. Pepper [...] "people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{year later}} in 1952, Cage applied his aleatoric methods to tape-based composition. Also in 1952, Karlheinz Stockhausen {{completed}} a modest musique concrète student piece entitled Etude. Cage's work resulted {{in his famous}} work Williams Mix, which {{was made up of}} some six hundred tape fragments arranged according {{to the demands of the}} I Ching. Cage's early radical phase reached its height that summer of 1952, when he unveiled the first art [...] "happening" [...] at Black Mountain College, and 4'33", the so-called controversial [...] "silent piece". The premiere of 4'33" [...] was performed by David Tudor. The audience saw him sit at the piano, and close the lid of the piano. Some time later, without having played any notes, he opened the lid. A while after that, again having played nothing, he closed the lid. And after a period of time, he opened the lid once more and rose from the piano. The piece had passed without a note being played, in fact without Tudor or anyone else on stage having made any deliberate sound, although he timed the lengths on a stopwatch while turning the pages of the score. Only then could the audience recognize what Cage insisted upon: that there is no such thing as silence. Noise is always happening that makes musical sound. In 1957, Edgard Varèse created on tape an extended piece of electronic music using noises created by scraping, thumping and blowing titled Poème <b>électronique.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Simultaneously in San Francisco, {{composer}} Stan Shaff {{and equipment}} designer Doug McEachern, presented the first “Audium” concert at San Francisco State College (1962), {{followed by a}} work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1963), conceived of as in time, controlled movement of sound in space. Twelve speakers surrounded the audience, four speakers were mounted on a rotating, mobile-like construction above. In an SFMOMA performance the following year (1964), San Francisco Chronicle music critic Alfred Frankenstein commented, [...] "the possibilities of the space-sound continuum have seldom been so extensively explored". In 1967, the first Audium, a [...] "sound-space continuum" [...] opened, holding weekly performances through 1970. In 1975, enabled by seed money from the National Endowment for the Arts, a new Audium opened, designed floor to ceiling for spatial sound composition and performance. “In contrast, there are composers who manipulated sound space by locating multiple speakers at various locations in a performance space and then switching or panning the sound between the sources. In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation {{is dependent on the}} location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese's Poeme <b>Electronique</b> (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stanley Schaff's [...] Audium installation, currently active in San Francisco” Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff “sculpts” sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.|$|E

In 1995, <b>électronique</b> d2 acquired La Cie, and later adopted the name 'LaCie' {{for all of}} its operations. At the early founding stages of both companies, both focused their businesses on IT storage solutions, based on the SCSI interface standard for connecting external devices to computers. SCSI was adopted by Apple Computer as its main peripheral interface standard and the market for both LaCie and d2 became closely, but not exclusively, associated with the Macintosh platform.|$|E
