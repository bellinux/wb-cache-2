30|$|In this study, expert {{experiences}} and opinions regarding handle designs of laparoscopic <b>graspers</b> and regarding implementation of enhanced haptic feedback were evaluated. This study shows, with a prevalence of 77  %, that physical complaints {{related to the}} use of laparoscopic instruments are commonly experienced. Whereas direct questioning revealed no similar handgrip preference among the surgical specialists, the handgrip usability assessment results favored the long-lever pistol grip design. Furthermore, the results regarding the utility assessment of haptic feedback show clinical support for the implementation of enhanced haptic feedback in laparoscopic <b>graspers.</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{assess the}} safety of steam {{sterilization}} of assembled laparoscopic instruments with challenge contamination. Method: a laboratory experimental study, using as test samples trocars and laparoscopic <b>graspers.</b> Geobacillus stearothermophillus ATCC- 7953 was used, with a microbial population of 106 UFC/Filter paper substrate, removed from the biological indicator. Three of them were introduced into each instrument {{at the time of}} assembly, and sterilized at pressurized saturated steam, 134 oC for 5 minutes. After sterilization, the instrument was disassembled and each filter paper substrate was inoculated in soybean casein culture and incubated at 56 oC for 21 days. In case of absence of growth, they were subjected to heat shock of 80 oC, for 20 minutes and re-incubated for 72 hours. Sample size: 185 <b>graspers</b> and 185 trocars, with 95 % power. We paired the experiments with comparative negative control groups (5 <b>graspers</b> and 5 trocars with challenge contamination, sterilized disassembled) and positive control (30 filter paper supports, unsterilized), subject to the same incubation procedures. Results: there was no microbial growth in experimental and negative control. The results of the positive control were satisfactory. Conclusion: this study provided strong scientific evidence to support {{the safety of}} steam sterilizing of the assembled laparoscopic instrument...|$|R

30|$|Diagnostic and {{operative}} hysteroscopies {{were performed}} with a 5.5  mm rigid continuous flow hysteroscopic system, with a five French working channel, {{connected to a}} 12 ° or 30 ° optics (Olympus®, Melville, USA). Uterine distension was achieved with normal saline solution. The input pressure was kept always below 100  mmHg. Operating instruments utilized included scissors, <b>graspers,</b> and the bipolar Versapoint system® (Gynecare Inc.), essentially the Twizzle electrode® (Versapoint) for coagulating and cutting. Simple biopsies were performed with <b>graspers</b> or bipolar electrode under direct hysteroscopic guidance. Polyps and fibroids resection was achieved with scissors and mainly with bipolar device by cutting their pedicles. In broad-based and bigger polyps and fibroids, first the formation was cut into slices to easy resection and cervical canal passage.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of the research I performed on designing a printable prosthetic finger. The desire {{was to create a}} design that would provide a new view on simple, and low cost alternatives for existing prosthetic fingers and industrial <b>graspers.</b> Robotic <b>graspers</b> show some amazing grasping capabilities, but their complexity, high production cost, and overall weight, inspired me to research a simplified mechanism that could equal their capabilities. The first part of my research consisted of a literature study on identifying all the existing working principles of mechanical <b>graspers.</b> The second part of my research consisted of coming up with a conceptual design that would be a simplistic, yet capable mechanism. Finally, an analytical model and prototype were constructed of my final design. I would like to thank my supervisor Just Herder for his guidance and help with brainstorming {{in the early stages of}} my research. Also, for his part on igniting my passion for trying to find mechanical solutions for everyday problems.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} hysteroscopic myomectomy using the Lin dissecting loop and Lin myoma <b>graspers</b> to remove myoma in a single procedure. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study performed in the gynecologic department of a general hospital. A total of 1569 women with submucous myoma or symptomatic intramural myoma underwent one-step resectoscopic myomectomy using Lin dissecting loop and Lin myoma <b>graspers.</b> Results: Of the 1569 patients, pedunculated submucous myoma, sessile submucous myoma, and intramural myoma were diagnosed in 943, 608, and 19 patients, respectively. The patients' median age was 38. 6 years (range 19 – 59 years). The operating time was between 4  minutes and 147  minutes (mean 30. 6 ± 18. 2  minutes). The specimen weighed from 0. 1  g to 380  g (mean 19. 9 ± 21. 4  g). Two uterine perforations caused by myoma <b>graspers</b> were encountered. No fluid complications were experienced. Almost all of the patients had improvement of symptoms. Long-term follow-up revealed five cases of abdominal total hysterectomy, one case of abdominal myomectomy, 21 cases of rehysteroscopic operation, 59 cases of normal spontaneous delivery, 36 cases of cesarean section, five cases of ongoing pregnancy, and one case of spontaneous abortion. No case of uterine rupture was encountered. There was one case of placenta accreta that required hysterectomy. Conclusion: Using our technique and instruments, {{it is possible to}} remove a myoma in a single procedure safely and effectively. This surgical method can also preserve more endometrium, cause less injury to the muscle layer, and prevent fluid complications...|$|R

50|$|A morcellator is a {{surgical}} instrument used for division and removal of large masses of tissues during laparoscopic surgery. In laparoscopic hysterectomy the uterus is minced up, or morcellated, into smaller pieces inside the woman's belly cavity {{in order to}} extract from the abdomen. It can consist of a hollow cylinder that penetrates the abdominal wall, ending with sharp edges or cutting jaws, through which a <b>grasper</b> can be inserted to pull the mass into the cylinder to cut out an extractable piece.|$|E

The massive payoff that Blanche gave Erard in the peace agreement that ended the war, however, propelled him to a place alongside the highest level of regional barons. Erard used his newfound wealth to buy up lands surrounding his own, so {{that he was able to}} cobble together his own larger barony.

50|$|This {{typically}} {{is associated}} with anatomic issues such as a redundant sigmoid colon or a transverse colon which prevents complete advancement of the colonoscope to the cecum. During an ELVIS procedure one proceduralist attempts a standard colonoscopy {{in the operating room}} with the patient under anesthesia. At the same time a surgeon introduces laparoscopic ports into the patient's abdomen. Typically one or two ports are necessary. Through one port a laparoscope is introduced (usually through a 12 mm port in the umbilicus) and another port is used for introduction of a laparoscopic instrument, such as a <b>grasper.</b> As the colonoscopy is being performed the laparoscopic instruments are utilized to position the colon as needed to assist with advancement of the colonoscope. This is accomplished by placing counter pressure where the scope is turning or holding the colon in a way to reduce angulation.|$|E
50|$|Lightning Tengeki: The Divine Power of Thunder is {{characterized}} by its supersonic speed, repulsion/attraction of the electromagnetic force, eye blinding brightness and unpredictable movement. Common attacks include focusing lighting in the hand and throwing it like a ball, or conducting it through a weapon to increase its damage. Skilled users can focus their lighting tengeki in the air, causing lighting to hit opponents. A unique defensive technique shown by Milfia is to conducting lighting on yourself, super charging your body. This createa a rather nasty shock when anyone touches you, be it friend or foe. This technique is dangerous {{for those who are}} not very skilled, because if one messes their control of lighting it could go throw your body and stop your heart. Like other elemental saiga, lighting saiga have more than one side to them. For example, Beet's and Bluezam's Boltic Axe appears to be just a giant golden axe, but there is more to the saiga than that. The axe is easily capable of cutting through bedrock, which makes it handy for killing vandals. When Beet swings the axe, he is capable of letting out a condensed form of lighting tengeki that can cut through hard boulder. However, its greatest ability lies in the axe itself. When Beet's life is in mortal peril, a seal in the axe opens up, and begins to suck anything and everything in the area into the void, acting as a black hole. This technique is so powerful, it drove off three seven star vandels from the area in seconds. Another example of a lighting saiga is Milfia's Lightbolt <b>Grasper.</b> Basically a giant pair of pinchers, this saiga is able to grasp enemies and hold them down, making it easier for teammates to attack. In extreme situations, Lightingbolt <b>Grasper</b> is able to clamp onto enemies and drive stakes from the saiga into the ground. Then, Milfia fires off an incredibly condensed ball of electricity, which can be controlled to move vandels hundreds of feet into the sky.|$|E
