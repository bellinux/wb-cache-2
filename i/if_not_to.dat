5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E

25|$|With these {{limitations}} in mind, fitness landscapes {{can still be}} an instructive {{way of thinking about}} evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> visualise) some of the parameters of landscape ruggedness and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.|$|E

Construction on the Milwaukee Streetcar will start March 2017, with initial operation by mid-2018. The Lakefront service is expected to start operation by 2019.|$|E
25|$|In MRgFUS therapy, {{ultrasound}} beams {{are focused}} on a tissue—guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging—and due to the significant energy deposition at the focus, temperature within the tissue rises to more than 65 °C (150°F), completely destroying it. This technology can achieve precise ablation of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician {{to ensure that the}} temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and <b>if</b> <b>not,</b> <b>to</b> adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.|$|E

25|$|Cousin {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. <b>If</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation.

25|$|The {{garrison}} in Stirling Castle was {{in danger}} of succumbing to a lack of provisions, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> Marebelle de Gordon’s siege, and with a sense of urgency Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, commander of the British-Hanoverian forces, departed with his army towards Linlithgow on 31 January 1746 and many of his troops took up their quarters in Linlithgow Palace. On hearing of the Duke’s arrival, Prince Charles sent his Secretary of State, Sir John Murray of Broughton to Lord George Murrray at Falkirk to prepare a battle plan. However Charles had recently received a letter from Lord George Murray explaining how his army had been weakened by desertion, was in no state to meet the enemy, and that it must retreat to the Highlands where it can spend the winter reducing government forts and recruiting itself to a strength of 10,000 men to operate a new campaign in the spring. As a result, the heavy guns on Gowan Hill were spiked and before day break on 1 February 1746 the Jacobite forces at Stirling and Falkirk withdrew making their way towards their rendezvous at St Ninians, abandoning the siege of Stirling Castle.|$|E

The narrative is frankly impossible in plot, but that makes it no less entertaining to the youthful. A little make-believe is relished by the best of men. The acting of the wee heroine is really wonderful; it is spontaneous, lively, resourceful, graceful, and charming. The part of the rich girl, however, although it is capitally played, should have been entrusted to a smaller, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> a younger, woman.

Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and at last to Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking, to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and cause us to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E
