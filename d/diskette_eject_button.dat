50|$|There are two {{different}} models of the DVD remote control released, which only had minor differences. The first released is the SCPH-10150. The second, SCPH-10420, is functionally and visually the identical apart from the addition of <b>eject</b> and reset/power <b>buttons.</b> However the <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> will only work on PS2 models SCPH-100xx to -500xx, as the slimline PlayStation 2 models had no motorized disc tray to eject.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic parts}} of the Twin Famicom include a 60-pin slot for Famicom {{cartridge}}s, a slot for Disk System's Disk Cards, a switch located right below the cartridge slot which allows the player to choose between [...] "Cassette (Kasetto)" [...] or [...] "Disk (Disuku)", the power button, reset <b>button,</b> and the <b>eject</b> <b>buttons.</b> FDS disks can be removed using the yellow button below the disk slot. The mechanism that it uses is similar to ones {{that are used in}} contemporary floppy disk drives. The <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> for cartridges is located between the power and reset buttons. It causes the cartridge to [...] "pop" [...] out of the slot, much like the way bread slices do when coming out of a pop-up toaster.|$|R
50|$|The DM 7025 has {{the ability}} to decode MPEG-2 HD as well. Unfortunately, it must downconvert this to 480i or 576i to display it.The DM 7025+ model {{features}} an Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of an LCD one, an <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> on the Common Interface slot and improved power supply.|$|R
50|$|The rear of {{the camera}} {{features}} a flashbulb <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> the viewfinder, and a red disc to protect the film from accidental exposure while providing readout of the current film position. It also features a battery door to power the flash, requiring two 1.5 volt Penlite batteries of at least 3.5 amperes each.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2014, {{a limited}} edition 1 TB bundle was {{released}} for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, featuring a dark grey and gold hardware, controller design, and customized sound {{effects on the}} console's power and <b>eject</b> <b>buttons</b> inspired by the aesthetics of the in-game Sentinel Task Force, a coupon for a digital copy of Advanced Warfares [...] "Day Zero" [...] edition, and special in-game items.|$|R
5000|$|... 1530 {{series in}} general: The 1530 series came {{standard}} with touch capacitive media and <b>eject</b> <b>buttons,</b> a slot-loading VHS drive, and an optional fingerprint reader. Both the touch capacitive buttons, and the optional fingerprint reader {{were removed from}} later series. the fingerprint reader was replaced in later models with a facial recognition webcam, for those {{with the desire to}} log on without the need to type a password.|$|R
500|$|In November 2014, {{a limited}} edition 1TB bundle was {{released}} for , with a [...] "worn", militaristic grey and black color scheme with gold accents and insignia detailing (including {{the emblem of}} the Sentinel Task Force), customized hardware sound effects for the power and <b>eject</b> <b>buttons,</b> and a matching controller.

50|$|Most of the {{indicators}} {{on a real}} jet fighter are present in Jet: altimeter, heading, frame loading, gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range. The player can turn {{a few of these}} on and off. The controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to handle the chosen optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and an <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> Different perspectives can be chosen - a view from the control tower instead of the jet's cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|This {{slow speed}} and low data rate hobbles the drives {{functionality}} and greatly increases seek find times, general performance and specifically write times (to {{an hour or}} more). On some riplock-equipped drives, riplock can be removed by firmware reflashing by the drives firmware (referred to as [...] "read speed patch" [...] or [...] "riplock patch"). It can also be disabled on some drives such as the Lite-On model iHAS324B by pressing the <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> for three seconds without any disc inserted.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in September 1986, Apple {{adopted a}} unified {{cross-platform}} product strategy essentially eliminating platform-specific peripherals where possible. The Apple 3.5" [...] Drive (A9M0106), is an 800K external drive released in unison with the Apple IIGS computer, and replaced the beige-colored Macintosh 800K External Drive. It works {{on both the}} Apple IIGS {{as well as the}} Macintosh. It came in a case similar to the UniDisk, but in Platinum gray. Like the UniDisk 3.5, the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive includes Apple II-specific features such as a daisy-chain connector which allows two drives to be connected to an Apple II computer, and the presence of a manual disk <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> The Macintosh however could still only accommodate one external drive, and ignores use of the <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> But, unlike the Macintosh 800K External Drive, the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive can be used natively with the 64K ROM stock Macintosh 128K & 512K without the HD20 INIT, but only with 400K MFS formatted disks. Designed as a universal external drive replacement, the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive was eventually compatible with the remaining Apple II models in production upon the introduction of the Apple IIc Plus and the Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller Card for the Apple IIe.|$|R
5000|$|Changed UltraBay design (the easy <b>eject</b> locking <b>buttons</b> were {{replaced}} by a hidden locking screw rendering [...] "hot swap" [...] functionality moot and earlier UltraBay modules incompatible) ...|$|R
2500|$|Criticism {{was placed}} on the new disc loader, stating: [...] "The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there's also an <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> to do the work for you, but there is no {{software}} eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to close the cover by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it's upright, and the PS3 won't start reading a disc unless you do [...]" [...] They also said there is no real drop in retail price.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphics}} and core gameplay {{are similar to}} 1982's more popular Time Pilot from Konami. In Acrobatic Dog-Fight {{the playing field is}} limited with a ceiling and ground as well as an ultimate destination to navigate to. Acrobatic Dog-Fight also adds two buttons, a secondary weapon and an <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> <b>Eject</b> can be used at any time and makes it possible to hijack enemy planes and continue flying them. If the pilot fails to hijack an enemy plane he would parachute to the ground where a standard plane waits nearby.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} {{release is}} located {{on the front of the}} grip making it easy to locate and also makes it ambidextrous as well since it is equally well placed for both right and left handed shooters. This is more of a problem for people with smaller hands where the finger tips may lay on the front of the handle when gripping the gun. Typically ejecting a magazine requires retracting your middle finger and pushing in on the release with the finger tip. The <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> is difficult to depress with the middle part of the finger.|$|R
5000|$|The SPARCstation 1 has {{space for}} up to two hard drives and one floppy drive internally. The machine will take any 50 pin SCSI-2 hard drive, but the OpenBoot {{firmware}} will not boot from any partition which starts or ends after 1024 MB.The floppy drive, like the Macintosh's, is unusual in that it has an electromechanical eject mechanism rather than the conventional <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> and therefore must be ejected by the operating system or OpenBoot. The machine can connect to any SCSI CD drive, via either the SCSI connector on the back or by connecting it to any spare internal SCSI connector via a 50 pin cable.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the SNS-101 is a large {{departure}} {{from that of the}} original SNS-001. The system features a smaller footprint than the older model and contains a much less angular design language. To reach an affordable price point, several features were removed. The system lacks the expansion slot {{on the bottom of the}} console featured on the SNS-001, making it incompatible with the Japan-exclusive Satellaview add-on. The power and reset buttons were moved to the left hand side, and the cartridge <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> has been removed entirely. Additionally, it lacks a power LED to indicate when the unit is on. The internal RF modulator was also removed; however, an external RF modulator can be used.|$|R
50|$|The Studio 15 (older 1535, 1536 and 1537 models) and 17 (1735, 1736 and 1737 models) {{suffer from}} {{problems}} with the touch sensitive controls where either the <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> or start button for Dell MediaDirect would stay lit {{for a few minutes}} after the unit was powered on, rendering the rest of the buttons useless. However, a firmware update for this media panel posted on the Dell Community forums has been reported to fix this issue. Another solution for this issue is to power down the laptop and remove the battery, then holding the power button for 30 seconds to fully discharge all remaining electrical power in the system, draining any residual flea power.|$|R
5000|$|The {{device was}} made of molded grey plastic with a lighter gray plastic stylus which is stored on the right hand side of the device under the keyboard. The left hand side of the device is {{taken up by the}} PCMCIA card slot and <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> On the {{right-hand}} side towards the back is the infrared port. On the back of the device is the proprietary serial connection which has a maximum baud rate of 115,200bit/s and the power adapter port. Power for the device was provided by 2 AA batteries with a CR2032 backup battery to save user data when the 2 AA batteries ran out. A single mono speaker, ROM door and battery compartment are located {{on the underside of the}} device.|$|R
50|$|The AppleCD SC Plus was Apple Computer Company's second CD-ROM as a {{replacement}} for the AppleCD SC which was introduced in 1991. It had the model number M3021, and it had just like its predecessor, the AppleCD SC and it had a 1x Read Only Media CD-ROM. The Plus could read a CD with up to 750 MB of data over the 650 MB of the AppleCD SC. It had indicator lights, an <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> mini-phone audio jack, volume knob, and the CD caddy drive {{on the front of the}} accessory. On the back there was two 50-pin Centronics SCSI connectors, audio RCA connectors, power input, and a power switch. The AppleCD SC Plus had only minor improvements over the AppleCD SC and it was relatively the same.|$|R
5000|$|The Game Boy Player is {{available}} in Indigo, Black, Spice, or Platinum in Japan; Black in North America and Europe and Black and Indigo in Australia. A special Game Boy Player for the Panasonic Q (SH-GB10-H) was released because the Q's legs are oriented differently from the original GameCube's. All Game Boy Players have screws on the bottom to secure it {{to the bottom of}} the GameCube and also have an <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> on the right side of the unit for removing Game Boy Advance games. Game Boy and Game Boy Color games stick out from the unit, as with the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP, so they can easily be taken out when the system is off or [...] "Change Cartridge" [...] has been selected from the menu.|$|R
5000|$|Rating {{the overall}} system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN's Peer Schneider finds the {{industrial}} design {{language of the}} 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate {{with that of the}} Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> sharing the N64's power button, and child-friendly usability. Installation is said to be [...] "quick and painless", operation is [...] "even simpler", and the whole system [...] "couldn't be easier to use". Software load times are described as [...] "minimal", where the most complex possible point of the system's library reaches about five seconds. The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of dialup Internet connectivity.|$|R
50|$|Early on, empty {{time slots}} were filled by going off the air, because the FCC {{at the time}} {{required}} a licensed human attendant at all times. When this requirement was later dropped, the station purchased a multi-cassette tape player, like might {{be used in a}} department store. It had four replaceable decks which alternated playing one after the other, and had no controls except for <b>eject</b> <b>buttons.</b> Because it already received so much wear and tear, the station still went off the air during the prolonged breaks between academic quarters. During the 1980s, the station would remain on air during morning/afternoon academic hours, going off air in the evening and weekends unless DJs were willing to volunteer. The station at the time was not a high priority among student activities and volunteer participation was often sparse.|$|R
50|$|She is {{a fellow}} A-rank magic-user with a {{straightforward}} attitude who possesses the power of regeneration with the capability of restoring her body, or the body of others, from otherwise fatal injuries though only within 5 minutes. Her regeneration is so effortlessly potent that she's able to regenerate from just her harness, meaning that she can only die if she doesn't take the medicine within the standard period of time or if her <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> is pressed. When she tested Ryouta's loyalty, she immediately becomes infatuated with him. Hatsuna becomes an important key to the club members' survival. She later bonds with her classmate Takaya, but soon after, she hatches. After killing Takaya, who steps in to stop her, she is smashed by Makina, but luckily her Drasil survived the unavoidable death, saving Takaya's life as well.|$|R
500|$|The Retina Display MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} design of the {{previous}} generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> At [...] thick, the 15-inch model is 25percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed {{at the bottom of the}} screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.|$|R
50|$|The AppleCD SC was {{the first}} CD-ROM by Apple Computer Company, {{introduced}} in 1988. It originally contained a fan but in 1990 they removed {{it because it was}} unneeded and attracted dust onto the optical disk head which could cause problems. It uses a front-loading caddy 1x CD-ROM and is only capable of Read Only Media. This accessory device was only able to read compact disks up to a 650 MB capacity in five formats, CD-Audio, CD-ROM, HFS, ProDOS, and High Sierra. On the front of the device it has an <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> mini-phono sound out jack, and a volume knob. On the rear it has a power switch, power input, two Centronics 50-pin SCSI outputs, and an audio RCA connector. With appropriate software it would run on any Macintosh with a DB-25 connector, or an Apple II with an Apple II SCSI interface card.|$|R
25|$|The {{operating}} {{system is not}} located in the Pippin's onboard storage, and is instead located on the CD-ROMs {{for each of the}} Pippin's software releases. Apple could thus upgrade the {{operating system}} without having to sell new hardware to the consumer. However, because of this, once Pippin software releases ended, it became impossible to upgrade to a later operating system, or install extensions and such. The system automatically reboots whenever the CD-ROM <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> is pushed, so a user can not load the system software off one CD-ROM, and then insert another CD-ROM. Apple intended for the Pippin platform to be an appliance, and encouraged consumers to purchase a fully featured Macintosh system if they were looking for something upgradable. Bandai never upgraded its system software beyond the 7.5.2 version. Hardware enthusiasts have been able to run system software as late as Mac OS 8.0, but this can only be done on a system utilizing a developer ROM-BIOS.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{begins when}} Mr. Voiceman ask the {{audience}} a question: [...] "What {{do you say}} when ... (insert type of usual but funny predicament: For example, [...] "When you press the <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> on a toilet seat?")? [...] ", and the audience would respond [...] "UH OH!" [...] with the main theme song heard. After the opening sequence, Mr. Voiceman would introduce the show's main host, Wink Yahoo with a statement themed to his opening question: [...] "The only (Canadian/North American) TV personality who... with a response of cheering from the audience. Wink would respond in kind to Mr. Voiceman and introduce the show's other hosts. Wink would ask Mr. Voiceman to introduce the teams and its two players, who were thereupon introduced followed {{by the introduction of}} The Punisher. Afterwards, Mr. Voiceman's duties were minor throughout the game: to announce the prizes won by the studio teams, Slime Tour players, and lucky audience members.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Slim {{model of}} PS3 has {{received}} positive reviews. Gaming website Spong praised the new Super Slim's quietness, stating [...] "The most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks {{a new area}} of the disc, such as when starting to load a game, and this occurs infrequently." [...] They added that the fans are quieter than that of Slim, {{and went on to}} praise the new smaller, lighter size. Criticism was placed on the new disc loader, stating: [...] "The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there's also an <b>eject</b> <b>button</b> to do the work for you, but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to close the cover by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it's upright, and the PS3 won't start reading a disc unless you do the cover." [...] They also said there is no real drop in retail price.|$|R
50|$|The episode {{opens with}} Ford and Arthur on Lamuella. Ford {{explains}} {{about the new}} guide {{and its ability to}} use Reverse Temporal Engineering in order to arrange circumstances for the benefit of its user. Ford's spaceship itself he obtained by jumping from a building and falling into it, its previous occupant having accidentally pressed the wrong sort of <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> Tracingback, he discovered that a trail of coincidences led back to the new Guide, which was responsible. With Random stealing the ship and the Bird, they are stuck, with no immediate way to get offworld to prevent the Vogons from doing whatever it is they intend to do. They decide that the Perfectly Normal Beasts are the best way off the planet. The migration has already started, and this sees them appear at one point, run past Lamuella, and then disappear again, evidence of a dimensional shift. Old Thrashbarg helps them slow a Perfectly Normal Beast long enough for them to get onto it, and tells them that they will be entering the Domain of the King.|$|R
50|$|Current optical drives {{use either}} a tray-loading mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a {{motorized}} or manually operated tray, or a slot-loading mechanism, where the disc is slid {{into a slot}} and drawn in by motorized rollers. With both types of mechanism, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc. Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller 80 mm discs (unless 80 mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or <b>eject</b> <b>button,</b> and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally. However, the Nintendo Wii, because of backward compatibility with Nintendo GameCube games, and PlayStation 3 video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80 mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.|$|R
25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the <b>eject</b> <b>button.</b> On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the first}} day of a new course. Upon walking into the room, you are met with sea of new faces of various shapes, colors, and expressions. Behind each face is an {{individual}} learner who is wondering how this new learning experience will proceed. You don’t even know their names, and yet you are faced with the daunting responsibility to ensure that the individuals in your program learn a new level of skill or knowledge. Like all well-prepared instructors, you have arrived with an organized agenda and course plan that clearly stipulates what will be covered, how the program will proceed, what is expected of learners, and how they will be evaluated. After brief introductions, you distribute the agenda. The individual differences are already emerging. Some learners will read every word of the syllabus, ask for clarification on several items, follow it closely, and regularly check off items as they are completed. Some will examine the content to determine if the course information will be thorough enough and if you, the instructor, are indeed knowledgeable enough to lead this program. Some are already wondering what practical relevance the program will have to their job responsibilities or to their lives in general.
