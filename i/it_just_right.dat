500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Annie Barrett {{opined that}} Stritch and Alda [...] "really made this episode great." [...] Meredith Blake, a {{contributor}} for the Los Angeles Times, opined that television Christmas episodes [...] "are a sitcom staple, but... they're also a risky proposition {{for a show}} like 30 Rock. Just how do you maintain the right balance between holiday cheer and year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> That is, they leaned toward the former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism – but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness." [...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart". Sassone noted that the problem with [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was Tracy's subplot [...] "as it wasn't very funny" [...] {{and the one that}} dragged the episode down.|$|E
500|$|Production of Spirited Away {{commenced}} in 2000 on {{a budget}} of ¥1.9 billion ($15 million). Disney invested 10% of the cost for the {{right of first refusal}} for American distribution. As with Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of 'stealing the show'. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the [...] "eye-candy" [...] in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a [...] "pretty girl." [...] At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked [...] "dull" [...] and thought, [...] "She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?" [...] As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel [...] "she will be a charming woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Joshua Rich from Entertainment Weekly {{had mixed}} {{views on the}} {{prospect}} of Michael returning in season four, because although Perrineau {{was one of his}} [...] "favorite" [...] actors, he liked how peaceful the series had become without Michael constantly screaming [...] "Walt!". IGN's Chris Carabott called Michael's return [...] "the worst kept secret in Lost history", but still found his reveal [...] "exciting". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau" [...] in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] Cynthia Littleton of Variety was [...] "really happy" [...] to see Michael again, and wrote [...] "Perrineau plays <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man {{trying to do the right}} thing, most of the time." [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Before the fourth season finale aired, Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season, but did add [...] "This story line didn't match the hype". Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael's death [...] "the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc".|$|E
500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] had a {{share of}} good reviews, with critics acclaiming the {{character}} development and emotional struggles of Michael. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found this [...] "middle chapter" [...] to be [...] "quite good" [...] with [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle {{to deal with the}} guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to [...] "Gay Tom" [...] as [...] "a unique and funny twist". Cynthia Littleton of Variety wrote that [...] "Perrineau plays <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man {{trying to do the right}} thing, most of the time." [...] In a four-out-of-five-star review, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones lauded the lack of interruption to the flashback and commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Dan Compora of SyFy Portal enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization of the rest of the main cast. In an overall positive review for the episode, The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that [...] "It seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way.

2500|$|... don't think I'm {{going to}} make albums in the old-fashioned way, meaning 12–15 songs, etc. in one small package. My desire at this point would be to release one song at a time, {{over a period of}} 2–3 years, with it all adding up to a box set/album of sorts that would also include an art movie of the album... My {{thinking}} is that if I focus on one song at a time I would approach them as beautiful, distinct paintings that would each require the attention they deserve.

It was to be found mentioned in Dugdale, and dated from the thirteenth century. I don't quite know what I expected. I argued to myself that {{there must have been}} ruffians of only moderate means even in those days. Here and there some robber baron who had struck a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely little castle. A few such, hidden away in unfrequented districts, had escaped destruction. More civilised descendants had adapted them to later requirements. I had in my mind, before the train reached Dorchester, something between a miniature Tower of London and a mediaeval edition of Ann Hathaway's cottage at Stratford. I pictured dungeons and a drawbridge, perhaps a secret passage. Lamchick has a secret passage, leading from behind a sort of portrait in the dining-room {{to the back of the}} kitchen chimney. They use it for a linen closet. It seems to me a pity. Of course originally it went on farther. The vicar, who is a bit of an antiquarian, believes it comes out somewhere in the churchyard. I tell Lamchick he ought to have it opened up, but his wife doesn't want it touched. She seems to think <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> as it is. I have always had a fancy for a secret passage.
