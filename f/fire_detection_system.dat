25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVideo <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> makes a {{significant}} contribution to the effectiveness of <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly as regards fire in large spaces such as Atria, Tunnels, Hangers, Warehouses and E&M Plant rooms, as traditional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been shown to be}} ineffective in large spaces. For the development of video <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> spatial, spectral and temporal indicators are important in the identification of a fire source. In the development of video <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> flame image segmentation, recognition, tracking and predication are important areas of investigation. The multi – threshold algorithm of Otsu's method and the Rayleigh distribution analysis method (modified segmentation algorithm) can be used in the segmentation of flame images. The modified segmentation algorithm, however, can be strengthen to extract the pool fire images making use of the optimum threshold values. Following such segmentation the pool fire images centroid analysis technique can be used to recognize pool fire images by means of the Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm. The objective of this paper is to examine the modified segmentation and the NN algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> is {{potentially}} a useful technique. With {{the increase in}} the number of surveillance cameras being installed, a vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> capability can be incorporated in existing surveillance systems at relatively low additional cost. Vision based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> offers advantages over the traditional methods. It will thus complement the existing devices. Conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> use physical sensors to detect fire. Chemical properties of particles in the air are acquired by sensors and are used by conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> to raise an alarm. However, this can also cause false alarms; for example, a person smoking in a room may trigger a typical fire alarm system. In order to manage false alarms of conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> a computer vision-based <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed system consists of two main parts: fire color modeling and robot navigation. The algorithm can be used in parallel with conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> to reduce false alarms in order to rescue indoor appliances. It can also be deployed as a stand-alone system to detect fire by using video frames acquired through a video acquisition device. A fire color model is developed in RGB color space to identify fire pixels. The proposed fire color model is tested with video sequences captured in different illumination condition in indoor ambience. The experimental results are quite encouraging in terms of correctly classifying fire pixels according to color information only. In addition; the navigation of the robot is tested through a simulated environment...|$|R
