5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer <b>jumps</b> <b>on</b> the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also <b>jumps</b> <b>on</b> to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{supported}} {{are several}} conditional jumps, including [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> zero), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> non-zero), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> greater than, signed), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> less than, signed), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> above/greater than, unsigned), [...] (<b>jump</b> <b>on</b> below/less than, unsigned). These conditional operations {{are based on}} the state of specific bits in the (E)FLAGS register. Many arithmetic and logic operations set, clear or complement these flags depending on their result. The comparison [...] (compare) and [...] instructions set the flags as if they had performed a subtraction or a bitwise AND operation, respectively, without altering the values of the operands. There are also instructions such as [...] (clear carry flag) and [...] (complement carry flag) which work on the flags directly. Floating point comparisons are performed via [...] or [...] instructions which eventually have to be converted to integer flags.|$|R

5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert <b>jumps</b> <b>on</b> a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points.
