5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano,</b> the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|They {{are taken}} {{to the home of}} the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty {{civilisation}} that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano</b> in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the legendary}} {{relationship}} of the volcano with King Nimrod, in 1990s scientists discovered that Nemrut {{played an important role}} in the life of the first civilizations. Despite the abundance of obsidian sources in Anatolia and Iran, Nemrut was the main source of obsidian – the most important material of the Stone Age – for all settlements in Mesopotamia and the settlements of the Mesolithic era around the Dead Sea. The analysis of obsidian products revealed that the population of those areas used obsidian from only two sources: Nemrut and the nearby <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano</b> Bingöl. An ancient center of obsidian processing and trade was found at Lake Van, which was part of one of the earliest trade routes.|$|E

500|$|Since Akagi was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} battlecruiser, the prevailing ship naming conventions dictated that she (like her sister ships) be named after a mountain. Akagi came from Mount Akagi, a <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano</b> in the Kantō region (the name literally means [...] "red castle"). After she was redesignated as an aircraft carrier, her mountain name remained, in contrast to ships like [...] that were originally built as aircraft carriers, which were named after flying creatures.

500|$|Eruptions are {{recorded}} in 1902, 1970 and 1993. A report of smoke emission in 1877 may have confused clouds for volcanic activity. In 1914, the volcano was described to be [...] "belching out clouds of smoke", although {{a report in}} 1971 indicated the absence of historical activity. These eruptions were accompanied by earthquake activity. During the eruption of 1902, heavy smoke and a night time glow on the volcano were observed. The eruption in 1993 involved a [...] long lava flow, but {{it may have been}} a flow of molten sulfur. The volcano is currently classified as a <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano.</b> Satellite imagery indicates, however, that ground deformation occurs at Taftan.|$|E
500|$|On the ahupuaʻa or land {{division}} of Waiʻaha, Kapeau had built his residence located about two thousand feet above Kailua-Kona {{on the slopes}} of the <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano</b> of Hualālai.

500|$|The {{source of}} the event was a fault rupture [...] south of the Caucasus Mountains, a {{mountain}} range that has been produced by the convergence of the Arabian and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The range is situated along an active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps in southern Europe to the Himalayas in Asia. The seismicity along this belt is marked by frequent major earthquakes from the Aegean Sea, through Turkey and Iran, and into Afghanistan. Though the recurrence of seismic events in Armenia does not reach the high frequency that is seen in other segments of this zone, rapid crustal deformation there is associated with active thrust faulting and volcanic activity. Mount Ararat, a [...] <b>dormant</b> <b>volcano,</b> lies [...] {{to the south of}} the quake's epicenter in Turkey.|$|E
