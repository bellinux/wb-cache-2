An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device. 1...|$|R

40|$|Choanoflagellates are {{unicellular}} {{and colonial}} aquatic microeukaryotes that capture bacteria using an apical flagellum {{surrounded by a}} <b>feeding</b> <b>collar</b> composed of actin-filled microvilli. Flow produced by the apical flagellum drives prey bacteria to the <b>feeding</b> <b>collar</b> for phagocytosis. We report here on the cell biology of prey capture in rosette-shaped colonies and unicellular "thecate" or substrate attached cells from the choanoflagellate S. rosetta. In thecate cells and rosette colonies, phagocytosis initially involves fusion of multiple microvilli, followed by remodeling of the collar membrane to engulf the prey, and transport of engulfed bacteria into the cell. Although both thecate cells and rosette colony cells produce ∼ 70 nm "collar links" that connect and potentially stabilize adjacent microvilli, only thecate cells were observed to produce a lamellipod-like "collar skirt" that encircles {{the base of the}} collar. This study offers insight into the process of prey ingestion by S. rosetta, and provides a context within which to consider potential ecological differences between solitary cells and colonies in choanoflagellates...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical/health status of veal calves in 3 farms that adopt large group housing and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> stations in Italy. Visits were scheduled in three phases of the rearing cycle (early, middle, and end). Results showed a high incidence of coughing, skin infection and bloated rumen particularly in the middle phase while cross-sucking signs were present at the early stage when calves’ nibbling proclivity is still high. Throughout the rearing cycle, the frequency of bursitis increased reaching 53 % of calves at the end. The percentage of calves with a poorer body condition than the mid-range of the batch raised gradually as well, likely due to the non-proportioned teat/calves ratio that increases competition for feed and reduces milk intake of the low ranking animals. The remarked growth differences among pen-mates and the mortality rate close to 7 % showed by the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> devices for milk delivery seem not compensating the lower labour demand, therefore its sustainability at the present status is doubtful both for the veal calves’ welfare and the farm incomes...|$|R

40|$|Much {{interest}} has developed {{in recent years}} in a procedure to rear neonatal pigs by use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> equipment. Several devices of similar design have been used for both sterile, disease free environments utilizing hysterectomy or cesarean-derived pigs and for pigs born normally and taken from the sow at 8 - 36 hours post-partum. The purpose of the research reported herein was to determine if an automated feeding device could be used to rear naturally-farrowed and hysterectomy-derived pigs with good performance and survival rate. Three experiments were conducted using 34 crossbred neonatal piglets to determine the feasibility of rearing newborn pigs with an <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device. In addition, three trials were conducted with 49 crossbred hysterectomy-derived pigs to study the requirements of disease-free pigs in terms of diets and management considerations. The major problem encountered throughout the six tests was microbial scours. Rotation of the drugs being used apparently countered the buildup of resistance in the organism(s) responsible. The hysterectomy pigs were more susceptible to scours {{due to a lack of}} passive immunity. Pig weight at birth appeared to be the most significant factor affecting survival. This relationship was true for both normal birth and hysterectomy-derived pigs. Advisor:E. R. Peo, Jr...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study proved <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> {{to be more}} {{suitable}} for farms with large number of calves as it could substantially reduce working hours. Design/methodology/approach: The experiment comprised 20 calves which were monitored from birth {{until the age of}} 10 weeks. On specific days (1 st, 8 th, 29 th, 50 th and 71 st) calves were weighed and their height of wither, height of rump and body length were measured. Findings: The comparison between feeding using bucket teat or <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the body weight during the period between 50 th and 71 st day of age (13. 30 kg and 9. 90 kg), in height of wither in the period between 8 th and 29 th day of age (1. 80 cm and 2. 70 cm) and in height of rump in the period between 29 th and 50 th day of age (1. 70 cm and 2. 70 cm). Research limitations/implications: On the first farm “A”, calves of Simmental breed were fed with milk replacer using a bucket teat (conventional feeding).
