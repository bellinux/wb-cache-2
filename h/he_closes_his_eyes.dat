6000|$|... "To be sure, a {{man must}} {{like to take}} a kind leave of his own wife before <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for ever; and I dare say {{it would be a great}} relief to you to tell him that you have {{forgotten}} his desertion of you, and all the hardships it has brought upon you in searching for him, and in earning your own livelihood as a common sailor." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the back}} of the tent drops into place, and all is {{darkness}} again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears it creeping close to him--now it is beside him. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in a treasure that fastens upon a man's mind. He will pray and blaspheme and still persevere, and will curse the day he ever heard of it, and will let his last hour come upon him unawares, still believing that he missed it only by a foot. He will see it every time <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He will never forget it till he is dead--and even then----Doctor, {{did you ever hear}} of the miserable gringos on Azuera, that cannot die? Ha! ha! Sailors like myself. There is no getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon your mind." ...|$|E

60|$|His voice sank {{to a low}} mumble, and <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wearily.|$|R
60|$|Reinhart staggered, {{holding on}} {{tight to the}} desk. <b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> gasping.|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} is taken by surprise, never having dreamt {{of a state}} of {{existence}} where existence itself seems suspended. He shakes himself in his coat, to see whether it be empty or no. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> to test the reality of the glassy expanse. He fetches a deep breath, by way of experiment, {{and for the sake of}} witnessing the effect. If a reader of books, Priestley on Necessity occurs to him; and he believes in that old Sir Anthony Absolute to the very last chapter. His faith in Malte Brun, however, begins to fail; for the geography, which from boyhood he had implicitly confided in, always assured him, that though expatiating all over the globe, the sea was at least margined by land. That over against America, for example, was Asia. But it is a calm, and he grows madly skeptical.|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: (Bloom trickleaps to the {{curbstone}} and halts again. He brushes a mudflake {{from his}} cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day {{the wheel of}} the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (<b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> an instant) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow! ...|$|E
60|$|Of course if {{you come}} to the place fresh from New York, you are deceived. Your {{standard}} of vision is all astray, You do think the place is quiet. You do imagine that Mr. Smith is asleep merely because <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he stands. But live in Mariposa for six months or a year and then you will begin to understand it better; the buildings get higher and higher; the Mariposa House grows more and more luxurious; McCarthy's block towers to the sky; the 'buses roar and hum to the station; the trains shriek; the traffic multiplies; the people move faster and faster; a dense crowd swirls to and fro in the post-office and the five and ten cent store--and amusements! well, now! lacrosse, baseball, excursions, dances, the Fireman's Ball every winter and the Catholic picnic every summer; and music--the town band in the park every Wednesday evening, and the Oddfellows' brass band on the street every other Friday; the Mariposa Quartette, the Salvation Army--why, after a few months' residence you begin to realize that the place is a mere mad round of gaiety.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and I did not further disturb him.|$|R
60|$|Then, hearing Markey {{open the}} door, <b>he</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and feigned sleep.|$|R

5000|$|As he {{examines}} his surroundings and options, Jerome realizes that his rifle is pointed right at him. He anticipates it going off at any minute {{since it was}} primed to fire before the explosion. He tries to distract himself from the metal ring facing him with other thoughts and even by closing his eyes but every time <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he feels the bullet burying into him.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Rome Niccolò {{sits on his}} windowsill {{looking up}} at the sun through a pair of sunglasses. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and imagines a science fiction film about a {{spaceship}} moving toward the sun. He recalls telling his nephew about space travel, saying, [...] "The day mankind understands what the sun is made of and its power, perhaps we'll understand the entire universe and the reasons behind so many things." [...] His nephew responds, [...] "And then?" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and with}} a smile he fell asleep. Uncle Tom too was free.|$|R

50|$|After Private Godfrey {{has taken}} his shots and missed the target completely, Regan makes Mainwaring shoot using his pistol, but after nearly being knocked over by the recoil and {{spraying}} shots wildly, Regan says {{that not only did}} he not hit the target, he actually missed the firing range. Next he forces Wilson to use a Tommy gun. Wilson is clearly terrified, <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to do the shooting and is still shaking rhythmically long after the clip is emptied.|$|E
50|$|Nichol is {{stepping}} through his daily paces in Loblaw’s airy, white test kitchen. Seven product-development staff hover watchfully. He forks {{a small sample}} of what appears to be chilli with meat into his mouth. The room falls silent. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He swallows. He nods his head. The tension breaks. Dave likes it.... This is market research, Dave Nichol style. No focus groups. No marketing surveys. If the president of Loblaw International Merchants, the product-development arm of Loblaw Companies Ltd., likes the taste, it’s in.|$|E
50|$|The {{child in}} blue {{finishes}} the sandwich with salad dressing, {{and makes the}} red man choose one of six condiments. The clock behind the pair strikes 12:00, and the video then switches to the band performing the song, along with clips of the woman from before, along with nostalgically shot home video-style footage of flowers, trees, waterways and a car trip. The final scene involves the red man, now a child again, being offered his completed sandwich by the blue child. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he takes a bite and everything fades to black.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and {{the boys}} {{thought he was going}} to faint. Chet got some more coffee.|$|R

50|$|At Peter Pan's camp, {{one of the}} Lost Boys, Devin, {{starts to}} bully Henry, {{prompting}} Henry to defend himself with a stick. Pan suggests that they use real swords. He tells Henry that Neverland runs on imagination and belief and so if <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and believes he’s holding a real sword, the stick will indeed become one. When it does, Pan is impressed. Henry uses the sword to cut his opponent's stick and slashes him across the face. He quickly apologizes for giving him the scar, but Pan and the other Lost Boys cheer Henry on.|$|E
5000|$|A key poem is [...] "Vocación". Its first stanza {{is almost}} a {{paraphrase}} of Guillén’s view of poetry as a contemplation of something in the world - saying the right words brings reality alive. The central stanza shows that Salinas questions this approach, which seems to give the poet no role beyond that of a mere spectator. In the final stanza, he gives his own conception of poetry, in which <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and sees how blurry and incomplete the observed world is until a poet comes along to supply what is lacking to make it something perfect.|$|E

50|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake set out to found a dungeon, but, after the two find it, Finn ends up getting trapped within. In {{the center of the}} {{structure}} he finds a door that, when <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he is able to pass through. However, every time Finn opens his eyes, he is transported back to being outside the door.|$|E
5000|$|Seward {{returns to}} go visit Lucy, where she {{attempts}} to seduce him (allowing her Vampiric side to take over). <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for a kiss, during which Lucy planned to drain him of blood, but Van Helsing enters the room, using a crucifix to [...] "kill" [...] her. In {{an attempt to}} explain why he had attacked Lucy, Van Helsing must expose his theory of Vampirism as a disease taking over Lucy's body. This disease would have had to have been spread to her by another Vampire, probably one with a permanent form of the affliction.|$|E
50|$|Again, the man {{thinks he}} hears someone {{and goes to}} the door. This time we get to see down the corridor; predictably it is empty, grey and ends in darkness. When he goes to the window we get to see outside this time; it is night, rain is falling in the dim light. The camera returns to the pallet and to the mirror which is a small grey rectangle, the same {{dimensions}} as the cassette. There is nothing reflected in the mirror at first. When the camera returns we see the man in it. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> opens them and then bows his head. Each of the inspections is interspersed with a God-like view from above.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a bone {{from his}} plate and tore some meat from {{it with his}} teeth, saying: ...|$|R
