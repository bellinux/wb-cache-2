40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} is {{to evaluate the use}} of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) as a screening tool for determining the causes of the non-justified days to help hospitals to decrease the length of stay while preserving the quality of care. Methods Three successive cross-sectional surveys were conducted from 2003 till 2005, in 23 Belgian hospitals. During this period, 10 Â  921 days were audited by means of the AEP. This study is focused on adult acute non-intensive care units. The appropriateness of each day of the sample was assessed, and for those considered as inappropriate, the reasons explaining the prolongation of the stay were investigated. Results The proportion of inappropriate days was 24. 61 %. There is a high variability across specialties and hospitals. Regarding inappropriate days, the analysis of causes of prolongation, globally, by bed index or by hospital, indicated clearly internal and external factors that lengthen stays. The most frequent reasons are waits for an examination (22 %) and the lack of extra-hospital structures (31 %). Conclusions The use of AEP as a tool of internal audit to measure the proportion of non-justified days and their causes turns out to be possible and the obtained results has provided some accurate and useful information for the participating, and allowed them to take concrete decisions which lead to shrinking of the length of hospital stay.

MethodAll incident lung cancer patients in the Haugalandet area in South-west Norway from 1990 through 1996 were followed from diagnosis till either death or end of follow-up 1 December 2003. Initial symptoms, anatomical stage, functional performance status, histology, initial treatment, terminal care, number of admissions as well as <b>days</b> of <b>hospitalisation</b> were recorded. ResultsOf a total of 271 patients (57 women) only 16 were still alive at end of follow-up. Median survival time was 170 days. Mean age at the first admission was 67. 4 years (range 21 – 89 years). Median number (inter quartile range) of admissions was 3 (2, 5) and total <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> 35 (18, 58). Altogether 26 % of the days in institutional care were spent in nursing homes. The 31 patients surgically treated had {{the highest number of}} hospitalisation days: 75 (56, 96). Young age, low anatomical stage and good performance status at time of diagnosis were associated with increased use of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days.</b> Cox regression analysis showed that treatment interventions and dyspnoea were significant predictors when adjusting for age, tumour stage and performance status.

40|$|ABSTRACTAlthough {{the first}} reports on extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing {{isolates}} in long-termcare facilities (LTCFs) appeared 10 years ago, {{there are still}} scanty data on this topic. A long-term survey starting in 1993 by the microbial laboratories of the Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris and covering 21 000 beds, 7000 of them in LTCFs, indicated {{that the incidence of}} ESBL-producing isolates/ 1000 <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> in LTCFs increased from 0. 07 in 1996 to 0. 28 in 2005. Escherichia coli accounted for 80 % of ESBL-positive isolates in 2005, whereas it accounted for < 45 % in 2001.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to control {{escalating}} health expenditures, especially in hospitals, many countries are planning or experimenting with prospective budgeting systems. Belgium is no exception and has recently introduced, with some success, limited fixed charges per hospital admission and/or per <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>day</b> for laboratory tests and radiographic investigations. More recently, the focus has shifted to hospital drug expenditures, which have shown high growth rates {{over the past few}} years. Until now, such expenditures have been reimbursed on a fee-for-service system, often with limited out-of-pocket charges for hospitalised patients. In order to curb the growth of drug expenditures, it is appropriate to investigate whether the financing of hospital drugs through a prospective budgeting system could be a feasible solution. Therefore, we constructed a database of over 270 000 admissions from a sample of 23 Belgian general and teaching (university) hospitals for the year 1991. Data were obtained from the official Minimum Basic Data Set or Résumé Clinique Minimum, which contains summarised clinical and administrative information, plus detailed expenditures (including medications) for each hospital stay. This information allowed us to categorize each stay into an appropriate diagnosis-related group (DRG). Our first descriptive analysis identified a number of major variables that influenced patients' drug expenditures: all-patient DRG (APDRG), age, disease severity, length of stay in an intensive care unit, emergency admission, death during hospitalisation, and hospital type (teaching or general). A covariance analysis was then performed on all hospital stays combined, and separately on surgical and medical stays. The results indicated that these variables taken together account for between 56. 5 and 76. 3 % of drug expenditures in medical and surgical stays, respectively, with the major variance explained by differences in APDRG category. However, when the data were disaggregated according to major diagnosis category, a large degree of heterogeneity in the explained variance was observed. In patients with drug use- and alcohol-related disorders, 5. 2 % of drug billings/expenditures were attributable to the APDRG, and the corresponding figure in patients undergoing circulatory system surgery was 84 %. This means that, if DRGs are used to define a global prospective drug budget for a hospital, using the hospital's historical case mix as a weighting factor, we should pay particular attention to the hospital profile because the predictive power of such a system could be relatively low in some hospitals. Consequently, we need to construct larger confidence intervals for hospitals in which historical drug expenditures have low predictive power, or search for additional explanatory variables for expenditures in these hospitals...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies have been {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation in lumbar spinal fusion, but there is still controversy about which one is more superior. We performed a meta-analysis to more accurately estimate the effectiveness of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation in lumbar spinal fusion. Studies on the comparison between unilateral and bilateral pedicle screw fixation in lumbar spinal fusion were identified from PubMed, SpringerLink, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wanfang database and the China Biology Medical literature database (CBM) and related references were searched. The included trials were screened according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion. The quality of included trials was evaluated. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. RevMan 5. 1. 1 was used for data analysis. The fixed or random effect model was selected based on the heterogeneity test among studies evaluated using the I 2 statistic. A total of nine studies involving 567 patients were included in the analyses for the effectiveness of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation in lumbar spinal fusion. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation was performed in 287 patients and bilateral pedicle screw fixation in 280 patients. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that statistically significant differences were observed between the two fixation procedures with regard to mean operation time and amount of bleeding. There were no differences in <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days,</b> fusion rate, complication rate, and excellent and good rates. This meta-analysis suggested that both unilateral and bilateral pedicle screw fixation are effective in one or two segmental lumbar spinal fusion. In comparison with bilateral fixation, unilateral fixation can shorten the operation time, reduce the amount of bleeding, and reduce medical expenses. There were similar effects with regard to <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days,</b> fusion rate, complication rate, and excellent and good rates...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{rehabilitation}} {{has become}} an evidence-based treatment for patients with severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). However, large numbers of patients who suffer from mild to moderate COPD receive treatment from their general practitioners (GPs). To encourage compliance, advice given to patients in general practice should be clear, practical, and acceptable. This is particularly true of the advice that is given by GPs to improve their patients' physical condition by walking, cycling or swimming, as recommended by the Dutch College of General Practitioners in their guideline for the treatment of COPD. We performed a literature search on the effects of physical activity in patients with mild to moderate COPD on exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and quality of life (QOL). We also looked at the numbers of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> and exacerbations, expressed as oral prednisolone courses. The literature search included Medline (1983 to 1999), EMBASE (1984 to 2000), and the Cochrane Library (2000). All hits were screened for subject and language and abstracts were {{selected on the basis of}} a protocol that included disease severity, hypothesis, outcome parameters, and control group. Review articles on physical exercise and COPD were examined and reference lists of selected articles were screened for relevant studies The broad literature search generated 4, 968 articles and, after exclusion according to title and abstract, 35 original studies and 27 review articles were analysed. Of these, five original studies fitted the criteria and none of the review articles was selected. A positive influence of physical activity on exercise tolerance in mild to moderate COPD was reported in four out of five studies. There was no clear effect on dyspnoea or QOL, probably because of the low numbers of subjects. No studies that addressed the number of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> or prednisolone courses as outcomes were included. Physical exercise training (usually as part of a package of rehabilitation) can improve the fitness of patients with mild or moderate COPD, but it has not been shown to benefit QOL or dyspnoea significantly, or indeed long-term disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Selecting the {{appropriate}} technique for surgical incisions, and reconstruction of facial defects after skin tumour excision {{has always been}} one of the surgeon′s biggest concerns. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the results between the local flap and skin graft to reconstruct cheek defects after basal cell carcinoma excision. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, 40 patients with skin defects resulting from skin tumour (Basal cell carcinoma) excision in cheek zones (16 sub-orbital, 18 bucco-mandibular and six auricular) were treated using local flap (n = 20) and skin graft (n = 20) from October 2010 to April 2012. All patients were followed up for 12 months, postoperatively. In addition, general assessments including complications, patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination, skin colour and <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> were obtained. Results: Five patients had postoperative hyper-pigmentation complication in the skin graft group and none occurred in the local flap (P = 0. 046). In the early postoperative period (2 weeks), mean scores in patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination and skin colour were statistically significant increase in the local flaps (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, respectively) and in the later postoperative period (12 months) only mean scores in skin colour significantly increased in the local flaps (P < 0. 001). The mean postoperative length of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> was 1. 7 ± 0. 4 days in the local flap group, and 3. 63 ± 1. 16 days in the skin graft group (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: In the local flap group: Patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination and skin colour were improved after 2 weeks. Also in 12 -months follow up visits, skin colour was improved significantly and the hyperpigmentation was reduced. Generally, in this study the local flaps had better results in clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

40|$|Worldwide studies {{demonstrate}} that living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, commonly indicated by income level, {{is associated with}} poorer health. Although researchers in Hong Kong have examined the impact of income inequality on mortality at area level, an income inequality indicator is not appropriate for use in this context, because the territory is partitioned into small, heterogeneous areas regarding income. A {{better understanding of the}} relationship between mortality and income is required. The first study examined temporal variations (1981 - 1985 and 2006 - 2010) in mortality by median monthly household income at the Small Tertiary Planning Unit level. It showed that residents of wealthy areas had lower mortality than those in poor areas in terms of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), excess death and total years of life lost, but not life expectancy. Improvements in social policy formulation, universal education and public health care may improve life expectancy. The results suggested a need for a broader investigation of neighbourhood health. Accordingly, in the second study, the first multiple deprivation index for use in Hong Kong was developed by Factor Analysis {{in order to be able}} to measure and monitor health inequalities. The impact of deprivation on mortality was examined by using Bayesian hierarchical approach. The generated multiple deprivation index had 7 domains and 22 socio-economic and environmental indicators with appropriate weighting. The most important domain was barriers to services, while income-related domains accounted for more than 50 % of the weighting. The spatial pattern of mortality was random. Deprivation did not have a significant impact on neighbourhood SMRs, but people living in areas characterised by lower education levels and more people working in elementary occupations were more likely to die prematurely. The unexpectedly weak relationship between deprivation and mortality prompted an investigation into whether deprivation influences other health outcomes. Thus, the third study examined the impact of deprivation on neighbourhood public hospitalisation. Areas with higher neighbourhood standardised hospitalisation ratios were located in the central city and urban areas. Children aged under five living in more deprived areas and those with pneumonia as a principal diagnosis were more likely to be hospitalised. Deprivation in terms of the housing and income factors was positively associated with hospitalisation, while the factors of barriers to services, demographic and living environment were negatively associated. The strong relationship between deprivation and hospitalisation suggested that resource allocation and the efficiency of the public hospital system is also an important issue. Hence, the last study investigated the change of the number of total <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> per person in 2000 - 2010 using a decomposition method. The mean duration of stay contributed most to the reduction in total <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days.</b> The side effects of the Hong Kong health care service, such as increasing public <b>hospitalisation</b> rates and <b>days,</b> gradually emerged from the data. The findings reported in this PhD thesis will draw policymakers’ attention to spatial heterogeneity of health outcome, the need to evaluate the hospitalisation system, develop community-based and universal public health care policies and tackle service provision and allocation issues in the near future. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The aims of this paper are: 1) to describe the caring activity that patients admitted to our 12 bed Cardiopulmonary Intermediate Intensive Unit (CPIIU) experience and, 2) to demonstrate that a noninvasive choice does not worsen mortality and the quality of care needed to improve patient outcome. From September 1 st 1990 to September 30 th 1992, 775 patients (135 respiratory subjects) were admitted. The majority of these patients came from Coronary Intensive Units or Medical and Surgical Intensive Care Units. Noninvasive cardiorespiratory monitoring was assessed in these patients, to obtain their clinical improvement. After this post acute observance, our patients were followed during a stabilization programme in the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation division until a day-hospital or home care programme was carried out.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{reviews of}} {{evidence-based}} {{guidelines for the}} clinical management of Bipolar Disorders (BD) have recommended that "all patients with BD be offered group or individual psychoeducation" to prevent relapse, improve treatment adherence, quality of life, and functioning. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of psychoeducation in routine mental health services in reducing number of hospitalisations and number of days spent in hospital, at a 1 -year follow-up. METHODS: A total of 102 outpatients were recruited from two Italian Departments of Mental Health. Inclusion criteria were a lifetime BD type I or II diagnosis, assessed with SCID, and ≥ 3 months of euthymia. Exclusion criteria were DSM-IV Axis I comorbidity, mental retardation (IQ< 70), organic brain damage, or deafness. All participants received standard psychiatric care, including standard pharmacological treatment; the experimental group also received 21 group psychoeducation sessions, weekly held and conducted according to Colom and Vieta's model.

The cost analysis was conducted using data from 18 patients included in the trial and from 15 so-called `match' patients. The latter group are patients with comparable diseases leading to spasticity and living in comparable circumstances. Next to absolute costs (direct and indirect) of care and treatment for the 2 groups of patients, cost differences between the 2 groups were considered (differential cost analysis). Setting: Per patient cost data, collected prospectively for 2 years during the phase of clinical evaluation, and retrospectively 1 year before implantation. The data were collected on patients from in- and outpatient care, home care and care in nursing home settings. Patients and participants: The trial patients (8 men) had a mean age of 46 years; 11 patients had multiple sclerosis and 7 patients had spinal cord injuries. The match patients (7 men) had a mean age of 48 years; 9 patients had multiple sclerosis and 6 patients had spinal cord injuries. Interventions: Trial patients were treated with a subcutaneously implanted programmable continuous infusion pump (SynchroMed, Medtronic), filled with baclofen (a muscle relaxant) to treat patients with chronic disabling spasticity who did not respond to a maximum dose of oral baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. Main outcome measures and results: An analysis of hospital stay between both groups showed a significant difference during the implantation year. The average number of hospital days per patient in that year in the treated group was 31. 5 days and in the match group was 18. 7 days. Significant cost differences between both groups in the year that started with pump implantation and the following year can be attributed mostly to the costs of implantation of the pump and related <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days.</b> The total costs of patient selection, testing, implanting the pump and follow-up amounted to $US 28 473 for the first year. Savings must be taken into consideration as well. The savings of direct costs were due to withdrawal of oral medication (estimated annual total of between $US 1950 and $US 2800 per patient). Indirect savings on employment and nursing home costs, amounted annually to $US 1047 and $US 5814, respectively. Scenarios make it possible to consider policy consequences. The case of `extending' the indications for this treatment to a larger population has been calculated and visualised. Conclusions: The costs of the therapy (continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen) can be attributed mostly to implantation of the pump and related <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days.</b> Savings originated from withdrawal of oral medication, job preservation and avoidance or delay of admission to a nursing home.

40|$|The {{trend is}} to {{definitely}} shorten hospital stays. It follows {{in the footsteps}} of a broader range of surgeries that can be managed in an ambulatory care setting. The expected benefits are: a reduction in costs, a shorter preoperative delay, a shorter absence for the work place and a lessened risk of hospital-borne infections. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for the success of such a program. Surgeons, anaesthetists and nursing staff must be prepared to modify and adapt their skills. The criterion of success for such an endeavour is a low level of readmissions and <b>hospitalisations.</b> If <b>day</b> surgery tends to keep the patient away for the hospital settings, it certainly places him in the centre of his medical management...|$|R

40|$|Skin {{and soft}} tissue infections (SSTIs) cause {{significant}} morbidity among intravenous drug users (IVDUs). Information about special features of SSTIs in IVDUs {{is essential for}} treatment. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study in a Norwegian university hospital. Using the ICD- 10 -classification, we selected admissions for abscess, cellulitis and erysipelas from two subsequent years and excluded non-IVDUs. From the patient charts we collected information about demographic data, anatomical localisations, microbiological findings and treatment. 192 admissions of 144 IVDUs were selected. IVDUs utilized 1 / 5 of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> for SSTIs and 1 / 3 for abscesses. Most SSTIs were localized in the lower extremities and 15 % had coexisting bacterial infections other than SSTIs. In abscesses, streptococci (42, 9 %), staphylococci (40, 0 %), gram-negative rods (8, 6 %) and anaerobic bacteria (6, 4 %) were the most commonly isolated strains. 1 / 4 had mixed cultures. In erysipelas and cellulitis, staphylococci (42, 3 %) and streptococci (19, 2 %) dominated. We found two strains of MRSA in one patient. Surprisingly, 8 % of staphylococci were clindamycin resistant and clindamycin was commonly prescribed, raising concern about selection of resistant strains. 85 % received effective antibiotics. There was compliance to guidelines for empirical antimicrobial therapy in 2 / 3 of cases, with most patients receiving dicloxacillin/cloxacillin or penicillin. Among non-compliant cases, {{a larger proportion of}} patients received ineffective and/or too broad-spectrum antibiotics. For abscesses, the use of antibiotics is generally controversial. Today’s guidelines for empirical therapy cover the most common pathogens in IVDUs. Our material was limited regarding erysipelas and cellulitis, but findings suggest that dicloxacillin/cloxacillin may be the better empirical treatment for IVDUs. In general, antimicrobial therapy was adjusted according to microbiological findings in only 50 % of the cases in our study...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{on social}} class {{differences}} in childhood health are controversial {{partly because of}} different data collection methods, limited sample sizes {{and the use of}} limited numbers of health indicators. The increasing collection of health register data enables the use of such data in social class studies. Our purpose was to investigate social class differences in mortality and morbidity among all children born in Finland in 1987 (N= 59, 865 liveborns) until the age of seven by using several national health registers, and to study whether perinatal health explains these differences. The follow-up was based on data linkage with six national health registers, with 18 regional registers of mentally disabled children, covering the whole country, and with 38 educational registers of the largest county. Morbidity was measured in terms of a cumulative disease index, the cumulative incidence of asthma, diabetes, epilepsy and intellectual disability, hospitalisations, disease-related welfare benefits and special education. Social class, divided in four groups (I-III, Others) was defined by using the mother's occupation at the time the child was seven years old. Our study showed that register-based data collection is a feasible method for studying social class differences in health. In the unadjusted analysis, social class differences were found for all indicators except mortality after the age of one year and for the cumulative incidence of asthma and diabetes. After adjusting for confounders, the children in the lowest social class had the highest risk for poor health outcome both in the perinatal period and in childhood, and had the most intellectual disabilities, the highest mean of <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days,</b> and received the most special education. The differences were not explained by perinatal health. The health {{of the children in the}} lowest social class was poorer, especially regarding mental indicators.

40|$|Schizophrenia {{continues}} to be a major healthcare expenditure in our society. Antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950 s and revolutionised its treatment; however, these drugs also produced numerous adverse effects. The direct and indirect costs of schizophrenia were estimated to total $US 33 billion in 1990. Prior to the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of clozapine in 1989, no new antipsychotics had been introduced in the US for at least 10 years. Clozapine was shown to be an `atypical' antipsychotic as some treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia responded. Negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia were also shown to improve with clozapine. However, because of the problem of agranulocytosis and the need for intensive blood count monitoring with clozapine, its usage became restricted. The cost of using clozapine was shown to be substantially higher than the older `typical' antipsychotics. This increased cost with clozapine resulted in its careful evaluation on the healthcare environment. Retrospective studies reported that <b>hospitalisation</b> <b>days</b> and number of violent episodes decreased with clozapine. Risperidone represents a new class of novel antipsychotics which, like clozapine, can improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and produce only minimal extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), but do not cause agranulocytosis. However, again, the cost of risperidone has resulted in its restricted use, especially in managed care organisations. Pharmacoeconomic studies have shown that risperidone decreases the overall healthcare costs among patients with schizophrenia. Other novel antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine and quetiapine were recently approved by the FDA and their clinical efficacy closely resembles risperidone. Further pharmacoeconomic and outcome studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these novel agents versus the older typical antipsychotics on our healthcare system.
