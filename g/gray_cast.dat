5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile.

500|$|Molybdenum {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. [...] The free element, a silvery metal with a <b>gray</b> <b>cast,</b> has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.

500|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of [...] was abrasive and cutting tools. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to wear. It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron. Hot hardness, fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide. The use of [...] cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, face milling of <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased tool life from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional tungsten carbide tools.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} wear {{resistance}} of the cylinder liner of the engines operating in desert area, the tungsten carbide-based cermet coating (WC- 12 wt. %Co) was produced using the supersonic plasma spraying technique. The microstructure and phase composition of the as-sprayed coating were evaluated. The effect of sand size in lubricant on the friction and wear behavior of the coating under the lubrication of oil containing sand was investigated on a ball-on-disk tribometer. Characterization of the coating shows that the coating possesses dense microstructure with low level of porosity. The decarburization of WC is limited for the high particle velocity of the supersonic plasma spraying {{and only a few}} of W 2 C phases are observed in the coating. With the higher hardness and the good adhesion with the substrate the sprayed coating exhibits a better wear resistance compared with the <b>gray</b> <b>casting</b> iron used in the current cylinder liner. Micro-structural examination shows that the wear of coating is dominated by micro-cutting, WC particles pull-out and sub-surface indentation-induced sub-surface cracking, while the main wear mechanism of the <b>gray</b> <b>casting</b> iron is micro-cutting and plastic deformation.

500|$|The {{belief that}} witches could cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland. In 1701 in Anstruther, Elizabeth Dick {{had been turned}} away from the local mill when begging. She cursed the mill and several {{witnesses}} testified that the grain in the mill turned red. Only when {{one of the people who}} had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal. About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time. The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing skills were largely seen as different from witchcraft. The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from folk magicians for success at fishing, to ensure a happy marriage, to prolong life and to affect the weather, but harmful spells were considered witchcraft. Many accusations included sexual fears. Margaret Bain, a midwife, it was claimed, could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman's husband and Helen <b>Gray</b> <b>cast</b> a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection. Witches and other sorts of folk magicians could also carry out divinations. These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal, measuring a person's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever, or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung, as [...] Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this {{research}} was to analyze the surface roughness, cutting tool forces and tool wear in machining <b>casted</b> <b>gray</b> iron. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted was turning process from other machining process. The turning is the widely employed manufacturing process. The tests were conducted by designing various cutting speed, feed and a constant depth of cut. In turning <b>casted</b> <b>gray</b> iron, flank wear, crater wear and built up edge are the common phenomenon. Findings: from the tests were the formation of flank wear, crater wear while machining the <b>casted</b> <b>gray</b> iron. Further research is possible in the direction measuring the residual stresses and the vibration of the cutting tool. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in carrying the tests namely vibration of the tool, tool wear and length of work piece. The constraint in measuring depth of crater wear was due to non availability of technology devices and equipments. However, the length of crater wear was measured for analyzes. Originality/value: The value of the work lies in the utility of the results obtained to researchers and users of the <b>casted</b> <b>gray</b> iron material for their components...|$|R

500|$|Gray {{had been}} {{interested}} in working with Wahlberg since seeing his performance in Boogie Nights (1997). After reading the script for The Italian Job, Gray contacted Wahlberg, who [...] "fell in love with it" [...] after reading it himself. Green was also attracted to the project because of the script. Theron was Gray's first choice for the character of Stella Bridger, and Wahlberg also recommended her for the role. She spent time with a safecracker in preparing for the role. <b>Gray's</b> <b>casting</b> director Sheila Jaffe suggested Statham {{for the role of}} getaway driver Handsome Rob, and Gray agreed with her choice.

50|$|Cast {{iron pipe}} is a pipe {{which has had}} {{historic}} use as a pressure pipe for transmission of water, gas and sewage, and as a water drainage pipe during the 19th and 20th centuries. It comprises predominantly a <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron tube and was frequently used uncoated, although later coatings and linings reduced corrosion and improve hydraulics. Cast iron pipe was superseded by ductile iron pipe, which is a direct development, with most existing manufacturing plants transitioning to the new material during the 1970s and 1980s. Little cast iron pipe is currently manufactured.|$|E
50|$|Molds for {{the casting}} process consist of two halves. Casting molds are usually formed from <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron {{because it has}} about the best thermal fatigue resistance, but other {{materials}} include steel, bronze, and graphite. These metals are chosen because of their resistance to erosion and thermal fatigue. They are usually not very complex because the mold offers no collapsibility to compensate for shrinkage. Instead the mold is opened {{as soon as the}} casting is solidified, which prevents hot tears. Cores can be used and are usually made from sand or metal.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the results}} of two raids, the main office of GAZ, a garage, a smithy, a {{stamping}} building, a professional technical factory, an archive, experimental workshops, a repair and mechanical workshop, a mechanical workshop No. 2, a power plant No. 2, a wheel workshop, a motor workshop No. 2, a foundry workshop of <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron, press workshop, residential area of the district. The building of the administration of the Dvigatel Revolyutsii was destroyed. In several places there was a panic. This contributed to the large number of refugees who filled the city (the Wehrmacht was already near Moscow), part of the population began to leave the urban areas. The plants stopped production, but the production of T-60 tanks on GAZ was still growing rapidly. The absence of antiaircraft guns allowed German aircraft to conduct sighting bombing from a low altitude. A total of 127 people died, 176 were injured severely, 195 were easily wounded (data vary in different sources). A large number of the deceased were refugees from Moscow, resettled in the Avtozavodsky City District. No German aircraft were shot down.|$|E
50|$|Most {{materials}} shrink as they solidify, but, as {{the adjacent}} table shows, a few materials do not, such as <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron. For the materials that do shrink upon solidification {{the type of}} shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than 50 C, a cavity, known as a pipe, forms {{in the center of}} the casting, because the outer shell freezes first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow solidification ranges. These materials tend to form a skin in open air molds, therefore they are known as skin forming alloys. For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than 110 C, much more of the casting occupies the mushy or slushy zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short mold life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the mold life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the mold life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The mold life is dependent on four factors: the mold material, the pouring temperature, the mold temperature, and the mold configuration. Molds made from <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> iron can be more economical to produce but have short mold lives. On the other hand, molds made from H13 tool steel may have a mold life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the mold life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the mold temperature is too low misruns are produced, but if the mold temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and mold erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the mold or casting can decrease mold life as well.|$|E
