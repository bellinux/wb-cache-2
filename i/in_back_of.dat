25|$|Eventually, Union {{soldiers}} {{found the}} uncompleted short trench <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the fort which allowed them an easier opportunity to climb onto the fort's parapet. The mass {{of men in}} the ditch had to move or be killed so they started to scale the walls or rushed around the moat to find the unfinished trench or sally port in the rear. Attackers were able to gain entry to the fort from the rear {{at the same time that}} a large number of Union troops finally managed to gain the top of the parapet. Soldiers of the 12th West Virginia Infantry Regiment were reported to be the first to cross into the fort after their flag had been planted at the top of the wall. After several bayonet charges, the Union attackers finally carried the works by sheer force of numbers and, after desperate hand-to-hand combat, forced the surviving defenders to surrender.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{important}} art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rodó has Uruguay's {{largest collection of}} paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant {{with regard to the}} fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. <b>In</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the museum is a beautiful Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Growth was arduous, as Lehigh had {{to compete}} with larger and better {{recognized}} institutions, such as Cornell, Chicago, MIT, and Johns Hopkins. However, Bethlehem Steel did exist as a key private supporter. Dr. Martin Whitaker was a physicist, and former executive in the Manhattan Project, and under his reserved, though strong, leadership, Lehigh eventually prospered. On April 10, 1957, {{and as part of}} a multi-phase plan of modernizing and expanding its business, Dr. Whitaker informed the Board of Trustees that Bethlehem Steel planned a research center for the top of South Mountain. The area was immediately <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of,</b> and contiguous with, Lehigh. Conceived with the University in mind, the center would make much expensive equipment available to the school, while providing the company with a computing and development center. Additionally, and as part of Steel's greater plans, Lehigh attained 600 acres in Saucon Valley for a Sports and Field Complex. Unfortunately, Dr. Whitaker could not see these plans to fruition, as he passed in office, August 31, 1960.|$|E

25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room off the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E

A heavy smoker who once refuted a claim that he sat <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> team buses to be alone by saying he did so to [...] "smoke cigarettes", Ripken died on March 25, 1999, at the age of 63 from lung cancer. He was buried five days later, at Baker Cemetery in Aberdeen. The Orioles wore a number 7 patch on their sleeves all through the 1999 season to commemorate Ripken's contributions to the team. A plaque hangs in the Orioles dugout at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to honor his long and distinguished career, and the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League is named in his honor.|$|E

To American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons recalled sleepless nights during the record's process, as the team was trying to prove that the debut album [...] "wasn't a fluke", which according to Lawrence is [...] "the absolute wrong mind-set to be". He went on expressing that the first four or five months they worked on the record were fruitless, because [...] "nothing would stick".

[...] Jack Blott, Michigan's 200-pound center, raced down the field and jumped on the ball. [...] Referee James Masker awarded a touchdown to Michigan. [...] Iowa fans, having not seen the ball touch any of the Hawkeyes, reacted angrily to the ruling.

[...] Not only did it win the contest for the Wolverines, but it marked {{one of the few times}} wherein a center is credited with having scored a touchdown... Blott's performance was all the more unique in that he passed the ball for Kipke's attempted drop kick and then raced down the field ahead of any of the other players in time to drop on the leather as it bounded across the final chalk mark [...] [...] [...]|$|E
