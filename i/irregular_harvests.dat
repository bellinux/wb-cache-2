No, though I sought Where ranks fell thickest.--'Twas {{indeed the}} place To seek Sebastian.--Through a track of death I {{followed}} him, by groans of dying foes; But still I came too late; {{for he was}} flown, Like lightning, swift before me to new slaughters. I mowed across, and made <b>irregular</b> <b>harvest,</b> Defaced the pomp of battle, but in vain; For he was still supplying death elsewhere. This mads me, that perhaps ignoble hands Have overlaid him,--for they could not conquer: Murdered by multitudes, whom I alone Had right to slay. I too would have been slain; That, catching hold upon his flitting ghost, I might have robbed him of his opening heaven, And dragged him down with me, spite of predestination.|$|R
40|$|In the {{production}} of tomatoes in greenhouses, {{a more or less}} constant number of tomatoes are ready for picking at each harvest time. In {{the production}} of bell peppers, however, large fluctuations exist in number of fruits ready to pick. This major problem in bell pepper production is called `flushing¿: weeks with high yields are alternated by weeks with low yield. This <b>irregular</b> <b>harvest</b> pattern makes it difficult for growers to meet regular weekly demands. As this cyclic production pattern is {{more or less the same}} for all growers, it results in weeks with a high market supply and low prices alternating with weeks with a low market supply and high prices. Flushing also results in strong fluctuations in labour demand in the greenhouses. Hence, avoiding an irregular pattern of sweet pepper production is of great economic importance. Flushing makes it very difficult for the growers to allocate sufficient labour force at a certain time in production. Both allocating too many and too few pickers will have financial consequences for the grower. The aim of this study is to predict the optimal harvest date based on repeated colour measurements of the growing bell peppers. The fruit ripening of bell peppers has been followed by colour imaging in the greenhouse. A commercial digital camera was used to record the development of colour for two cultivars of bell peppers over time. The images were analysed by image processing to obtain the R, G and B values. At the same time the time to harvest was recorded for the same fruits. Using these data a model was developed, on the basis of an exponential function towards a fixed asymptotic end value, to describe the colour development during fruit growth in terms of R/G ratio and to predict the optimal harvest date of the fruits...|$|R
40|$|Broccoli is a {{significant}} contributor to Queensland vegetable production and exports. A major problem faced by growers is <b>irregular</b> and non-uniform <b>harvests,</b> resulting in high labour costs and variable yield and supply volumes. A series of experiments were conducted to determine if plant growth regulators (PGrs) {{could be used to}} improve productivity of broccoli, in particular harvest uniformity and harvest manipulation. Key findings from this project indicate the PGRs prohexidione-CA and uniconazole both could delay broccoli harvest. Prohexidione-Ca when applied one day prior to anticipated first harvest, and then harvest delayed for 7 days, resulted in 95 % of heads in marketable size range. Further investigations and research are planned to follow up on these key findings...|$|R
30|$|Much {{effort has}} been made to meet the huge energy demand of modern society while {{minimizing}} environmental cost [1]. Widely distributed water kinetic energy is an abundant source for large-scale applications and is much less dependent on seasonality, day–night, weather, and temperature variations [2, 3, 4]. Especially in the form of water flow, it contains a gigantic reserve of kinetic energy, but is hardly utilized in an effective way [5, 6, 7]. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a powerful technology for harvesting low-frequency mechanical energy with characteristics including lightweight, low cost, and wide selection of materials [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. More improvements {{have been made in the}} use of TENGs to achieve a human–machine interface [14, 15]. Essentially, TENGs demonstrate much better output performance than that of traditional electromagnetic generators (EMGs) at low frequency (typically 0.1 – 3  Hz), which confirms the possible application of TENGs for <b>harvesting</b> <b>irregular</b> and low-frequency motion energy such as that from water flow [16, 17]. How to use this novel technology to achieve energy collection and conversion attracts much attention.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo new {{fields are}} {{introduced}} to the sensor community: strained induced piezotronics for smart CMOS and a nanogenerator that harvests mechanical energy for powering nanosystems. Fundamentally, due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry, such as ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. We have replaced the externally applied gate voltage to a CMOS field effect transistor by the strain induced piezopotential as a “gate” voltage to tune/control the charge transport from source to drain. The devices fabricated by this principle are called piezotronics, with applications in strain/force/pressure triggered/controlled electronic devices, sensors and logic units. The principle of <b>harvesting</b> <b>irregular</b> mechanical energy by the nanogenerator relies on the piezopotenital driven transient flow of electrons in external load, which can be resulted from body motion, muscle stretching, breathing, tiny mechanical vibration/disturbance, sonic wave etc. As of today, a gentle straining can output 1 - 3 V at an instant output power of ∼ 2 μW from an integrated nanogenerator of a very thin sheet of 1 cm 2 in size.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} the {{feedback}} decoupling technique to a Kolmogorov type model for three species food webs with harvesting or replenishment. A feedback control law is derived to decouple {{the effect of}} predators from prey dynamics. It is found that the necessary and sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} the decoupling control law rely on the persistence of the prey population {{and the fact that the}} specific growth rate of prey depends explicitly on the superpredator population density at any moment in time. It is shown that, without any control action of regulated replenishment or <b>harvesting,</b> <b>irregular</b> or chaotic behavior is possible in such a process for certain ranges of the system parameters. This is illustrated by the construction of a bifurcation diagram for a model of a three-species food web with response functions of the Holling type II. To make the system output or variables less sensitive to irregular disturbances, the feedback control technique is applied which produces the desirable effect of stabilizing the system. When such a model is applied to an activated sludge process, the objective of the control action can also be to regulate the inputs in order to obtain satisfactory water quality.

40|$|Community {{forestry}} in Nepal {{is intended}} to reduce poverty by sustainable management of forests. Timber {{is one of the}} most high-value forest products, especially in the case of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the Terai region of Nepal. Despite having several advantages, including high value forests on fertile land, connection with transportation networks, and being close to regional markets, community forests in the Terai region produce little or no timber from their Sal forests. This research looks at what is affecting the production of Sal timber from community forests. Three aspects of community forest user groups (CFUG) are examined using institutional economics, transaction cost economics and micro-economics. First, the scale of CFUG operations is examined in terms of their ability to profitably carry out logging and organise market sales. Second, the capacity of CFUGs to carry out logging in terms of internal physical and human resources, and property rights is examined. Finally, barriers to vertical integration with the market in terms of contracting and cooperation with other CFUGs are investigated. To answer these questions, data was collected from 85 CFUGs and interviews were carried out with 39 key respondents from CFUGs, government agencies, and private firms. The results show that the size of the forest was not an issue for harvesting and marketing logs. However, the organisational capacity of CFUGs was found to be weak because of a lack of financial resources, limited property rights over timber, control over decisions by the District Forest Office, policy constraints, and corruption. In terms of vertical integration, a lack of legal rights to enter into contracts, a high degree of uncertainty about policy and property rights, small and <b>irregular</b> amounts timber <b>harvest,</b> and the interpretation of CFUG rules by the District Forest Office were found to be barriers for the formation of long-term contracts between CFUGs and private firms, and of cooperative developments between CFUGs.

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{support the}} livelihoods and food security {{of millions of}} people worldwide, and if well managed can make significant contributions to socio-economic development. Coastal populations in developing countries can be highly reliant on coastal resources as small-scale fisheries provide an important source of income generation, are an important source of food, and in many areas often provide the primary source of dietary protein and micronutrients. However the sustainability of small-scale fisheries and the benefits they provide are under increasing pressure as populations grow, markets develop, technologies change and environments become degraded. Community-based and collaborative strategies (i. e., co-management) emerge as an important strategy to address challenges faced in managing small-scale fisheries. By engaging small-scale fishers in management, comanagement can more effectively sustain benefits provided by fisheries. In so doing, co-management can support the three pillars of food security i. e., by protecting resource availability and access, the role of fisheries in nutrition may be sustained or improved. The expansion of co-management initiatives is particularly apparent in the Indo-Pacific where centralised approaches have typically had low levels of success in managing subsistence and domestically-marketed fisheries. In this region co-management initiatives combine scientific information and conventional approaches to marine resource management, with local knowledge and institutions; a model referred to as locally managed marine areas (LMMAs). There are now hundreds of coastal communities with LMMAs in which a range of resource-use rules are developed and implemented at the community level, often with support from government or non-government organisations (NGOs). However, despite widespread arguments that such models of co-management can result in sustainable fisheries, empirical studies that systematically demonstrate benefits to fisheries and to food security are lacking. My thesis presents a case study of Solomon Islands to address the overarching question; do locally managed marine areas contribute to sustainable smallscale fisheries, and what are the implications for food security? I address this question by examining local fisheries governance arrangements and outcomes in Chapters 2, 3 and 4, and national level governance support structures and outcomes in Chapter 5. LMMA initiatives frequently promote the re-establishment or re-invention of customary periodically harvested marine closures as a measure to regulate marine resource use. Periodically-harvested closures are touted as being a successful, traditionally based measure for marine management, and often emerge as the principle management measure within LMMAs. Although periodically-harvested closures confer fisheries benefits for some taxa in western fisheries management contexts, {{there is little evidence that}} they are effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. In Chapter 2 I systematically review cases from across the Indo-Pacific region to explore the opening and closure cycles, concurrent harvest control measures, and fisheries objectives, and outcomes of periodically-harvested closures as they are employed in practice. I find that harvesting and closure regimes are highly variable, with some areas remaining predominantly closed and subjected to <b>irregular</b> one day <b>harvests,</b> while others are harvested for periods extending to weeks or months. Periodically-harvested closures are commonly placed over reef habitats, and are most frequently employed to manage trochus fisheries. I found few reports of restrictions being placed on periodic harvests, and few reports of concurrently employed restrictions on marine resource use in the broader fisheries area. This review clearly illustrated that there has been a lack of systematic research exploring the fisheries outcomes and potential limitations of periodically-harvested closures. To address the knowledge gap identified in Chapter 2, I conducted an interdisciplinary study of periodically-harvested closures as a measure to control fishing effort, and to maintain and improve catch rates and yields. In Chapter 3 I aimed to determine whether fishing pressure (both in terms of effort and yield) was alleviated by implementing periodically-harvested closures, and whether resultant levels of harvesting were sustainable. I also aimed to understand how implementing periodically-harvested closures altered access to resources, and if their implementation resulted in displacement of fishing effort to other areas. In Chapter 3 I documented cycles of opening and closure applied in four periodically-harvested closures, decisions driving those cycles, access rights to closures through time and by different sectors of the local communities, and the broader management frameworks that influenced exploitation and management outcomes. I found duration and frequency of openings was highly variable, with open periods ranging from a single night to one month in duration, and occurring between one and 15 times per year. Fishing during openings was permitted for entire fishing communities in some cases, and only for specific rights-holding families in others. Decisions to harvest closures tended to be based on immediate social or economic needs. Harvesting during openings was restricted to a single taxon and single method in some cases, or unrestricted multi-species, multi-method harvesting in others. Periodically-harvested closures were the main form of management in use at all case study locations. In examining patterns of fishing pressure I found that fishing effort (mean fisher hours per day) during openings was relatively intense (between four and 60 times higher) compared to average daily effort on reefs continuously open to fishing. However over a full year, total effort and total harvested biomass from closures was low to moderate compared to open reefs. I found that effort was not significantly displaced onto open fishing grounds due to closures, likely because of the small size of closed areas relative to continuously open and accessible fishing grounds. In Chapter 4 I examined the characteristics of catch to test hypotheses that emerged from the review in Chapter 2 i. e., that in periodically-harvested closures (a) catch rates (catch per unit effort; CPUE) are higher, (b) short lived, fast growing, sedentary taxa are more abundant, and (c) finfish and invertebrates are larger, compared to harvests from reefs continuously open to fishing. I compared catch rates and catch composition from periodic harvests to harvests of continuously-open fishing grounds, and also examined changes in catch rates throughout the opening period to look for depletion effects. I found that CPUE was significantly higher from periodically-harvested closures for gleaning, but not for spear and line fishing. In one periodically-harvested closure where data were sufficient for analysis of catch rates throughout the periodic harvest, I did not find quantitative evidence of significant fisheries depletion indicated by declines in CPUE for line and spear fishing. However catch rates from gleaning for invertebrates declined throughout the periodic harvest; CPUE was significantly higher in the early stages of the periodic harvest compared with open reefs, but not in the later stages of the harvest. This evidence, alongside reports from fishers and declines in effort (particularly for gleaning), suggests there was substantial localised depletion of invertebrate stocks. Family level catch composition was similar to open reefs for two closures. The small amount of dissimilarity in catches was due to relatively higher abundances of families of high rebound potential i. e., Strombidae, Acanthuridae and Balistidae. Six out of the eight species analysed were larger when harvested from periodically-harvested closures than those harvested from open reefs, but only Lutjanus rufolineatus was significantly larger. Trochus (Trochus niloticus) was significantly smaller from closures than those harvested from open reefs, which may be due to the effect of prior harvests. To summarise the local fisheries governance arrangements and outcomes presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4; periodically-harvested closures are a socially acceptable management measure, frequently implemented within co-management frameworks across the Indo-Pacific. My research indicates periodically-harvested closures can achieve at least short-term benefits by bolstering catch rates of invertebrates, and leading to catches with slightly larger fish in some species. However, harvesting during periodic harvests was intense, and there was evidence that this led to substantial localised depletion of invertebrate stocks. Further, as social and economic needs (rather than ecological knowledge and indicators) often drive decisions to open areas to harvest, the short-term fisheries benefits may be threatened by rising demand, and heavier and more frequent fishing events in the medium to long-term. There is a need for future studies to address long-term fisheries benefits of periodically-harvested closures. I found that periodically-harvested closures were the main form of management employed by communities with LMMAs. However, achieving nation-wide sustainable fisheries management will require marine resource governance to be comprehensive and widespread, requiring more than the currently localised and small scale advances. In response to this challenge, environmental governance is increasingly focused on connecting local management to higher scales of policy and planning. Governance networks are suggested as institutions that can foster cross-scale relations between actors for collective purposes. In Chapter 5 I present my analysis of a governance network explicitly established to strengthen and extend outcomes|$|R
