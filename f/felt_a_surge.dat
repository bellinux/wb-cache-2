60|$|Columbine {{watched that}} quiet face, while her heart throbbed and swelled with {{emotions}} wholly beyond her control and understanding. When at last Wilson opened his eyes, fluttering at first, and then wide, she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> that shook her whole body. He smiled wanly at her, and at Wade, {{and then his}} gaze lifted to Belllounds.|$|E
6000|$|Janet <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of relief, {{in which}} were mingled anxiety and resentment: relief {{because she was}} {{convinced}} that Lise was telling the truth, anxiety because she feared for Lise's future, resentment because Ditmar had been mentioned. Still, what she had feared most had not come to pass. Lise left her abruptly, darting down a street {{that led to a}} back entrance of the Bagatelle, and Janet pursued her way. Where, she wondered, would it all end? Lise had escaped so far, but drunkenness was an ominous sign. And [...] "gentlemen"? What kind of gentlemen had taken her sister to Gruber's? Would Ditmar do that sort of thing if he had a chance? ...|$|E
60|$|Then the King whistled and reared. Lucy heard swift, dull, {{throbbing}} beats. Beats of a fast horse's hoofs on the run! She <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surging</b> {{thrill of}} joy. She could not think. All of her blood and bone and muscle seemed to throb. Suddenly the air split to a high-pitched, wild, whistling blast. It pierced to Lucy's mind. She knew that whistle.|$|R

60|$|He {{suddenly}} {{gripped her}} arm. It {{was the first}} time he had touched her, and she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> queer <b>surging</b> of the blood to her head, a sudden and almost uncontrollable repulsion. The touch of his long fingers was like flame; his eyes, behind their sheltering spectacles, glowed in a curious, disconcerting fashion.|$|R
60|$|These {{words were}} {{scarcely}} {{out of my}} mouth, when three seas of enormous height came rolling down upon us, like three great roistering companions in a crowd of sullen men, {{the first of which}} raised the Dawn's bows so high in the air, as to cause us both to watch the result in breathless silence. The plunge into the trough was in a just proportion to the toss into the air; and I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge,</b> as if something gave way under the violent strain that succeeded. The torrent of water that came on the forecastle prevented any thing from being seen; but again the bows rose, again they sunk, and then the ship seemed easier.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{circumstance}} eased {{its grip on}} him. As he started {{to come out of}} the tent he saw a huge bull-moose crossing the swale some four hundred yards away. Morganson <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> and bound of the blood in him, and then went unaccountably weak. A nausea overpowered him, and he was compelled to sit down a moment to recover. Then he reached for his rifle and took careful aim. The first shot was a hit: he knew it; but the moose turned and broke for the wooded hillside that came down to the swale. Morganson pumped bullets wildly among the trees and brush at the fleeing animal, until it dawned upon him that he was exhausting the ammunition he needed for the sled-load of life for which he waited.|$|E
5000|$|In her NDE account, Eadie reports many {{phenomena}} {{similar to}} other NDE accounts, such as going through a dark tunnel, seeing a bright light and experiencing a Life review, {{as well as other}} features unique to her story. In 1973, at age 31, Eadie was recovering from a surgical operation. Eadie reported that she first felt herself fading to lifelessness, then <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of energy followed by a [...] "pop" [...] and feeling of release, a sense of freedom and movement unhindered by inertia or gravity. She was met by three angelic beings who spoke with her about her prior existence and hitherto suppressed memories in order to participate in earthly experience. She traveled to terrestrial locations such as her home merely by thinking about them, returned to her hospital, and then passed on through a dark tunnel-like medium in which she reported sensing other beings in a transitory preparatory stage.|$|E
5000|$|... “show’s {{guest of}} honour … Her mind was not what it was; {{but there was still}} the look of {{mischief}} about her. Tossing sticks and medics aside, Mama staggered onto the stage, where she was given a standing ovation. With great dignity, she inclined her head and acknowledged the nation. She’d no idea she was appearing on television. As the cheering continued and I clasped one of her hands in my own, I <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> enormous <b>surge</b> of pride. She really was a magnificent old girl.” [...] Dorothea Macnee died on 29 Nov 1984 aged 88 at nursing home in Beckington near Bath, Somerset.|$|R
60|$|When all was ready, the man {{reached in}} his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp {{rustling}} as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended {{to put him in}} a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> great <b>surge</b> of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.|$|R
60|$|The hunters laughed from sheer relief. Tragedy had dwindled, the farce had begun. The sailors now crowded boldly aft, {{grinning}} and shuffling, {{to watch}} the pummelling of the hated Cockney. And even I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> great joy <b>surge</b> up within me. I confess that I delighted in this beating Leach was giving to Thomas Mugridge, though it was as terrible, almost, as the one Mugridge had caused {{to be given to}} Johnson. But the expression of Wolf Larsen’s face never changed. He did not change his position either, but continued to gaze down with a great curiosity. For all his pragmatic certitude, it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in the hope of discovering something more about it, of discerning in its maddest writhings a something which had hitherto escaped him,—the key to its mystery, as it were, which would make all clear and plain.|$|R
