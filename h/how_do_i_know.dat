500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death {{may in fact be}} better than life: [...] "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?" [...] His writings teach that [...] "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|A November 6, 1971, cartoon in The New Yorker by Whitney Darrow, Jr. shows a {{cleaning}} lady {{on her hands}} and knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: [...] "I'd like to see George Plimpton do this sometime." [...] In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient looks up at the masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, [...] "Wait a minute! <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're not George Plimpton?" [...] A feature in Mad Magazine titled [...] "Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton" [...] spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square in the middle of the night, and spending a day with Jerry Lewis.|$|E
6000|$|Again: [...] "I fancy that God {{ought to}} be good. But <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that He really is good? I see the world full of injustice, and misery, and death. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that this is not}} God's doing, God's fault in some way?" ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. She {{asked me}} <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he wasn't, and fetched me a clout {{on the side}} of my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "That letter worried me. I {{began to}} wonder if, after all, I had chosen the right girl. Suppose Hannah was not all I thought her! What a terrible thing {{it would be for}} Josiah. What data, {{sufficient}} to reason upon, had <b>I</b> possessed? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that Hannah was not a lazy, ill- tempered girl, a continual thorn in the side of her poor, overworked mother, and a perpetual blister to her younger brothers and sisters? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> she had been well brought up? Her father might be a precious old fraud: most seemingly pious men are. She may have learned from him only hypocrisy.|$|R
6000|$|... "No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can't {{always have}} brains {{as well as}} beauty. What have we for lunch? Stew? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of onions is unmistakable." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{all this}} time no dinner! All this time H. is at the glacier! <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> but she has fallen into a crevasse? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> but that a cliff, one of those ice castles, those leaning turrets, those frosty spearmen, have toppled over upon her? I shudder at the reflection. I will write no more.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Is {{my destiny}} any longer {{in my own}} hands? Go: ask SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED.|$|E
60|$|AUNT JUDY. Oh, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> She {{slipped out}} a little while ago: I thought she was goin to meet the car.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I {{could not}} till I had proved {{to myself that}} there was no time-serving in them, if you must know the truth!' said Owen, {{colouring}} a little. 'Besides, having been told my wits would go, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> but that they were a symptom of my second childhood?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know'd {{my name to}} be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it? Much as I know'd the birds' {{names in}} the hedges to be chaffinch, sparrer, thrush.

6000|$|... "But then {{nobody could}} {{be certain that}} the monster {{at the bottom of}} the bay needed rest or sleep. He might be able to count without stopping, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that he couldn't check off four hundred claws a minute? If that {{happened}} to be the case, our time must be nearly up.|$|R
60|$|LIZA [halting, tempted] <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{what might}} be in them? I've heard of girls being drugged by the like of you.|$|E

60|$|STREPHON. I do {{not want}} the girl who is to be born today. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what she will be like? I want you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Crime! Pooh. They don't {{think much}} of such as that over there! Lots of 'em do it... Well, {{if you take it}} like that I shall go back to him! He was very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and as respectable as any married couple in the colony! <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where you were?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then also, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that Juliana's merry childishness {{would not}} ripen into sweet, cheerful womanliness? Her father, for all <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to the contrary, {{might be the}} model of what a retired sea-captain should be; with {{possibly}} a snug little sum safely invested somewhere. And Juliana was his only child. What reason had I for rejecting this fair young creature's love for Josiah? ...|$|R
60|$|It took me an hour {{to climb}} up {{that part of the}} slope which {{constituted}} the thicket of oak, maple and aspen. It was half-past three when finally I reached the saddle where we had shot at the grizzly. I rested as long as I dared. I had still {{a long way to go}} up that ridge to the rim, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> whether or not I could surmount it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well; but <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that you're the man {{represented}} in that letter? Pancho Robles may know you, but I don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE (somewhat indignantly: {{any such}} discussion, except {{by way of}} pleasantry, being outside her code of manners). <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Why do you ask me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a sad}} {{task for}} me, Eric!" [...] she sighed, [...] "for <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that Baresark's hands shall not loose this helm of thine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{perhaps this}} is very fanciful; {{and it may be}} that she was merely bored with her husband and went to Strickland out of a callous curiosity. She may have had no {{particular}} feeling for him, but succumbed to his wish from propinquity or idleness, to find then that she was powerless in a snare of her own contriving. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what were the thoughts and emotions behind that placid brow and those cool gray eyes? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{advanced}} to the window. It was open, {{and it was just}} high enough to be above my head. The light in the room found its way outward through the interstices of closed wooden shutters. Still haunted by misgivings of trouble to come, I hesitated to announce my arrival precipitately by ringing the house-bell. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what new calamity might not confront me when the door was opened? I waited under the window and listened.|$|R
60|$|Seeing me pausing {{before the}} door, {{he rose and}} invited me to enter. I obeyed with {{singular}} hardihood, for <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> whether {{a wave of his}} wand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster or conjure me into one of the bottles on his mantelpiece? He proved, however, to be anything but a conjurer, and his simple garrulity soon dispelled all the magic and mystery with which I had enveloped this antiquated pile and its no less antiquated inhabitants.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{thought you}} were in Europe," [...] he muttered. Hope flickered for a moment. [...] "Look here, you're joking me. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're Swithin Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{leave me}} here? Leave me {{alone in this}} house after what has happened? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my wife may not come back to-night? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> her journey is not a blind to mislead me? Have you no feeling, Lecount? Can you leave me in my miserable situation--?" [...] He sank into a chair and burst out crying over his own idea, before he had {{completed}} the expression of it in words. [...] "Too bad!" [...] he said, with his handkerchief over his face--"too bad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|PRIEST Not yet, for if {{you should}} get it, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you'll not be off to your palace without even {{beginning}} your dance, not even a measure? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was a child}} {{going along}} out there {{and asked me if}} the postman had been by and I said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and she said <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen to me, you villain,' said Beckwith, 'and let {{every word}} {{you hear me}} say be a stab in your wicked heart. When I took these rooms, to throw myself in your way and lead you on to the scheme that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> my {{appearance}} and supposed character and habits would suggest to such a devil, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that? Because you were no stranger to me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you well.

60|$|Yet {{what could}} <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> Tell Masapo <b>I</b> {{had seen his}} wife being embraced by another man? Surely that was not my {{business}}; it was Masapo's business to attend to her conduct. Also they would both deny it, and I had no witness. Tell him that Saduko's reconciliation with him was not sincere, {{and that he had}} better look to himself? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it was not sincere? It might suit Saduko's book to make friends with Masapo, and if I interfered I should only make enemies and be called a liar who was working for some secret end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I did not know! I {{did not ask}} to be baptized! Cruel, cruel parents, {{to bring}} me to it! And God! Oh, why did He forgive me so soon? And {{to go into the}} deserts! I dare not! I cannot! See me, how {{dedicate}} and tender I am! I should die of hunger and cold! I should go mad with fear and loneliness! Oh! brother, brother, is this the Gospel of the Christians? I came to you to be taught how to be wise, and good, and respected, and you tell me that all I can do is to live this horrible life of torture here, on the chance of escaping torture forever! And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I shall escape it? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I shall make myself miserable enough? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that He will forgive me after all?

6000|$|... "I see it, I deduce it. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{that you}} have been getting {{yourself}} very wet lately, and {{that you have}} a most clumsy and careless servant girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A great scheme truly," [...] said Hafela in admiration; [...] "but <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{whether all}} this tale is true, {{or whether you}} do but set a snare for me?" ...|$|E
60|$|At length came Amy's letter, {{with the}} last account which she had at Rouen from the Dutch skipper, which, {{confirming}} the other, left me out of doubt that this was my man; but still no human invention could bring me to the speech of him {{in such a manner}} as would suit with my resolutions. For, after all, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what his circumstances were? whether married or single? And if he had a wife, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he was so honest a man he would not so much as converse with me, or so much as know me if he met me in the street.|$|R
6000|$|Romayne smiled uneasily. [...] "I daresay you're right," [...] he answered. [...] "But, remember, I {{had left}} my aunt, feeling {{ashamed of the}} unjust way in which I had thought and spoken of her. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> mightn't be wronging an old friend next, if I kept Peterkin at a distance? His present {{position}} may be as much his misfortune, poor fellow, as his fault. I was half inclined to pass him, as you say--but I distrusted my own judgment. He held out his hand, {{and he was so}} glad to see me. It can't be helped now. I shall be anxious to hear your opinion of him." ...|$|R
