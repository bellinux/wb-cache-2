5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>parts</b> {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500HV.|$|E
5|$|New to {{the series}} is the Autovista mode, a mode in which players can view precise details such as <b>engine</b> <b>parts</b> and {{interior}} gauges on a select number of cars. It features a partnership with BBC's Top Gear {{as well as its}} American counterpart. Jeremy Clarkson and James May, former co-presenters for Top Gear, provide commentary in the game's Autovista mode. Other partnerships include a two-year agreement with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). Over 500 cars and 26 tracks are included.|$|E
5|$|The BT19 was not raced {{in serious}} {{competition}} after 1967. Brabham retired and {{moved back to}} Australia {{at the end of}} 1970. He retained ownership of the car until 1976, when it passed into the hands of Repco and was restored by the Repco <b>Engine</b> <b>Parts</b> Group. In 1986, Automotive Components Ltd. (ACL) was formed by the management buyout of <b>Engine</b> <b>Parts</b> Group, which included the transfer of the BT19 to the new company. Since its restoration, the car has frequently been demonstrated at events, including the 1978 Australian Grand Prix at Sandown where Brabham was involved in a spirited demonstration with Juan Manuel Fangio driving his Mercedes-Benz W196. Brabham and the car also appeared at the first Australian Grands Prix to be held on the Adelaide (1985) and Melbourne (1996) street circuits. It also appeared at the 2004 Goodwood Revival meeting in the United Kingdom. ACL sold the car back to Repco in 2004. In 2008 the car was installed in the Australian National Sports Museum at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, on loan from Repco.|$|E

5|$|Exhaust gas {{temperature}} margin erodes with usage, {{one or two}} performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin; after that, the life limited parts must be replaced, after 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the axial compressor and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56 : the whole <b>engine</b> <b>parts</b> cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing <b>engine</b> <b>parts.</b> Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for <b>engine</b> <b>parts.</b> Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E
