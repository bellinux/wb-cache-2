50|$|Despite {{changing}} the ending, the film <b>was</b> <b>still</b> seen as controversial by the Catholic Federation, who objected to its depiction of Catholicism. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{passed by the}} censor.

5|$|These types {{would now}} all {{be treated as}} {{peculiar}} Type II supernovae, of which many more examples have been discovered, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor.|$|E
5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2005, Global Heritage Fund (GHF), in {{partnership}} with Tsinghua University (Beijing), has been working to conserve the cultural heritage of Foguang Temple's Great East Hall. The hall has not had any restoration work done since the 17th century, and suffers from water damage and rotting beams. Despite the temple undergoing restoration, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> open to the public. On June 26, 2009, the temple was inscribed {{as part of the}} Mount Wutai UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|Brownsea Castle was {{purchased}} by Mary Bonham-Christie in 1927. She allowed the property to fall into disrepair {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in a very poor condition. It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} {{raised by}} Crozier in 2006 {{that the project}} would be halted after the first phase, which were dismissed at the time, no further work has actually been completed on the Essex Bypass since 2012, and the section between Essex and Ruthven remains a two lane highway. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered as a future project by the MTO, with no time line set.|$|E

5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> there today, though no longer in use.|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy, {{even in its}} fourteenth season, is ABC's highest-rated drama. While its {{ratings have}} fallen {{over the course of}} its run (it was once among the overall top 10 shows in the United States), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> one of the highest-rated shows among the 18–49 demographic, and the No. 3 drama on all of {{broadcast}} television.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Hugh Fulton {{organized}} 142 {{specific and}} varietal names into eighteen species groups containing {{a total of}} 64 species. When Henry Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph Manual of Conchology appeared, {{the number of species}} in the genus Amphidromus had increased to 81, and these were placed in nineteen groups. Pilsbry's study has remained the only illustrated monograph of the genus, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> considered indispensable for any serious study of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> {{not certain}} {{how many people}} died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E

The fictional Belford Regis of her eponymous novel, first {{published}} in 1835, is largely based on Reading.
