40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is defined for commercializing slags arising as by-products of steelmaking, {{and this is}} used to develop certain products. The outcome of the present work comprised three products or groups of products: 1) slag-based binding agents, 2) a road structure improved by means of stabilization with such binding agents, and 3) a procedure for designing stabilized structures. The commercialization procedure was drawn up by examining the technical properties of the initial materials, excluding environmental acceptability and the mechanisms of their chemical reactions. The research proceeded in stages, of which {{the first was a}} reconsideration of the results presented in the author's licentiate thesis concerning factors affecting the stabilization of road construction aggregates with blast-furnace slag-based binding agents and their significance. This was followed by a series of experiments designed to test the validity of these results. At the third stage the selection of slag-based binding agents was extended to include LD steel slag products, while the final stage consisted of the implementation of a set of test structures and associated preliminary experiments and monitoring measurements. The binding properties of three blast-furnace slag products and three LD steel slag products, used separately or in various combinations, were examined {{in the course of this}} work, taking cement as a reference material. Materials were then eliminated as the research proceeded, either on account of their poor binding properties or on economic grounds. The final construction experiments were performed with three combinations: cement-activated <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag,</b> LD steel slag-activated <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag</b> and a mixture of ground <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag</b> and cement. The actual novel product among the slag-based binding agents to be introduced here is LD steel slag-activated <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag,</b> which was found to be similar in its technical properties to cement-activated <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag.</b> Structural layers stabilized with these two binding agents showed very similar bearing capacities, although the former did not reach the same compression strengths at an age of 91 days. The reasons for these similarities lay in a larger amount of binding agent used when activated with LD steel slag and the greater thickness of the stabilized layer, factors which both tended to compensate for the poorer compression strength. The new information gained on the properties of cement-activated <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag</b> and the mixture of ground <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace <b>slag</b> and cement opens up fresh opportunities for selecting binding agents and designing road structures. Formulae were developed here for predicting the uniaxial compression strength at 91 days, used as a stabilization criterion, from the value for a sample taken at 28 days, a technique which will speed up the assessment of stabilization results, especially when using slowly reacting slag-based binding agents...|$|R

They contain siliceous and aluminous materials, and react with lime or cement, having the economic potential to replace some of the lime or cement presently used as an additive in the stabilisation of soil. Four (4) types of soils were treated with varying quantities of lime, cement, rice husk ash, <b>granulated</b> blast furnace <b>slag,</b> combinations of rice husk ash with lime or cement and combinations of <b>granulated</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> with lime or cement under laboratory conditions. To determine the effectiveness of RHA and GBFS as stabilisers, general geotechnical soil properties, including unconfined compressive strength, undrained shear strength, CBR, plasticity index and linear shrinkage, were measured.

It is revealed that rice husk ash alone is not suitable for modifying soil properties, however, beneficial results are obtained when it is used in combinations with lime or cement. It is shown that lime-rice husk ash and cement rice-husk ash additives increase the unconfined compressive strength, the CBR and the undrained shear strength of soils.

A modern principle was put forward in the article: blast furnace is an apparatus for manufacturing of two basic types of products : cast iron and slag.

An {{analysis of}} the existing methods of granulation was carried out and factors influencing the quality of granular slag were determined, as well as the ways of obtaining granular slag with the required physical and mechanical characteristics. The main factors of granulated slags quality, employed for manufacturing of binding materials are chemical composition and the structure of fine granulated particles. All wet methods of granulation are characterized by high humidity of <b>granulated</b> <b>slag,</b> its value reaching 24, 5 %, due to increase in granules’ porosity. Real options for reducing humidity of <b>granulated</b> <b>slag</b> may include: development of the process of granulation, ensuring manufacturing of products with increased density and low content of fine fractions, dehydration of slag in high bunkers and stacks at sufficient soaking time and slag blowdown with a stream moving downwards. Using mechanical granulators and gaseous energy carriers (air) for melt’s dispersion is an efficient way of reducing water consumption for granulation (semi-dry or dry methods of granulation). It also makes it possible to reduce r consumption of water, supplied for granulation from 3, 0 to 0, 7 - 1, 5 m 3 /min.
