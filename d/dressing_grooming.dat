25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> can be difficult for children with CP as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers. Compared to other disabilities, people with cerebral palsy generally need more help in performing daily tasks.|$|E
25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} {{assessment of}} patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This {{means that the}} patients are asked to define their goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Functional deﬁcits can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at the individual level rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming).</b> It is useful to make a distinction between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E

5000|$|Activities {{of daily}} living (ADL) is a term used in {{healthcare}} to refer to daily self care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. Health professionals routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regard to people with disabilities and the elderly. ADLs are defined as [...] "the things we normally do...such as feeding ourselves, bathing, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> work, homemaking, and leisure." [...] The ability {{and the extent to}} which the elderly can perform these activities is at the focus of gerontology and understandings of later life. In an 'active society' which sees mobility as an important norm, constant physical activity has replaced the striving towards personal growth in later life.|$|E

Occupational therapy may be necessary following an injury or illness in order to regain skills and to receive support during any physical or cognitive changes. [...] Occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living such as bathing, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming.</b> Occupational therapy also assists with instrumental activities of daily living which include home and financial management, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. Occupational therapists work to allow the person to safely and comfortably reintegrate into society by practicing public dining, transferring to different surfaces (chairs, beds, couches etc), and will assess the need for any home modifications or safety equipment to ensure a proper and safe transition. When a cognitive and/or perceptual deficit is presented, therapists will work with the person by teaching strategies to maximize memory, sequencing and attention span length.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} of pain has many cultural dimensions. For instance, {{the way in}} which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, and age. An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would. Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs. Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain. The older adult may also stop doing activities they love because it hurts too much. Decline in self-care activities (<b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> walking, etc.) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain. The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to. They may not want others to see them as weak, or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain, or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions.|$|E

40|$|Parents who {{undertake}} {{paid work}} {{are obliged to}} spend time away from their children, and to use nonparental childcare. This {{has given rise to}} concern that children are missing out on parental attention. However, time-use studies have consistently shown that parents who are in paid employment do not reduce their parental childcare time on an hour-for-hour basis. Since there are only 24 hours in the day, how do parents continue to be engaged in direct care of their own children while also committing significant time to labor market activities? Using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey 1997 (4, 059 randomly selected households) to compare the time allocation of employed fathers, employed mothers, and mothers who are not in the labor force, this paper investigates how this phenomenon arises. The strategies available are reducing the time devoted to other activities (principally housework, sleep, leisure, bathing, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> eating), and rescheduling activities (from weekends to weekdays, or changing the time of day at which particular activities are undertaken).

40|$|Demented {{persons of}} the Alzheimer type, {{and to a lesser}} degree, persons {{suffering}} from major depression, experience a loss of autonomy in their activities of daily living (ADL). This loss of autonomy is often associated with a decrease in the initiation, organization and continuation of the activity. The Psychogeriatric Basic ADL Scale developed for this study, was especially created for the aged experiencing a loss of autonomy as a consequence of problems other than motor and/or sensorial. It assesses the following activities: taking of a bath (or shower), <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> continence and feeding, in relation to some higher cognitive functions. In this study, the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the scale were evaluated using a sample of normal, depressed and demented subjects. The test-retest reliability was high (Spearman's rho = 0. 98), and the concurrent validity of this scale with the Rapid Disability Rating Scale- 2 was also high (Spearman's rho = 0. 93).

40|$|Abstract Background The study {{objective}} was to compare physical function documented in the medical records with interview data, and also to evaluate hospital mortality predictions using pre-admission and on-admission functional status derived from these two data sources. Methods A prospective cohort study of 1402 subjects aged 65 [*]years and older to the general medicine department of an acute care hospital was conducted. Patient-reported pre-admission and on-admission functional status for impairment {{in any of the}} five activities of daily living (ADLs) items (feeding, <b>dressing,</b> <b>grooming,</b> toileting and bathing), transferring and walking, were compared with those extracted from the medical records. For the purpose of mortality prediction, pre-admission and on-admission impairment in transferring from the two data sources were included in separate multivariable logistic regression models. We used a variable selection method that combines bootstrap resampling with stepwise backward elimination. Results For all ADL categories, the agreement between the data sources was good for pre-admission functional status (k: 0. 53 – 0. 75) but poor for on-admission status (k: 0. 18 – 0. 31). On-admission impairment was higher in the medical records than at interview for all basic ADLs. Using interview data as the gold standard, although sensitivity for pre- and on-admission ADLs was high (59 – 93 %), specificity for on-admission status was poor (30 – 37 %). The pre-admission models using interview data predicted mortality better than the model using medical records (c-statistic: 0. 83 versus 0. 82). Similar results were found for models incorporating on-admission functional status (c-statistic: 0. 84 versus 0. 81). However, the differences between the four models were not statistically significant. Conclusion Medical records can be a good source for pre-admission functional status but on-admission functional impairment was over-reported in the medical records. The discriminatory power of the hospital mortality prediction model was significantly improved with the incorporation of functional status information but it was not significantly affected by their time reference or source of data. </p...|$|E
