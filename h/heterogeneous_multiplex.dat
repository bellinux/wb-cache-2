40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a method called z-characterization for {{computing}} the deterministic bounds of an aggregated MPEG stream at frame level. Traditional deterministic characterization methods like empirical envelope generally {{suffer from the}} drawback of high computation complexity. In our approach, the I, P and B sub-traces of an MPEG trace will be characterized independently such that they possess their own empirical envelopes, By exploiting the periodic group-of-pictures (GOP) structure of MPEG video, the I, P and B sub-envelopes can act as building blocks for computing the characterization of the aggregate stream in real-time. Experimental results show that our proposed characterization closely bounds the empirical envelope in both homogenous and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>multiplexing</b> scenarios.

40|$|In {{this paper}} fluid models for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>multiplexed</b> traffic are considered. First, some {{extensions}} {{to the general}} theory applicable to superposed, time-reversible Markovian Rate Processes are given. These refer to the connection between performance metrics, the consideration for singular systems and {{the continuity of the}} solution, with respect to the system parameters. The general framework is then carried over to the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>multiplexing</b> of ON/OFF sources. By combining the general theory with the special structure of the ON/OFF sources several important facets of this structure are highlighted. As a result, more powerful methods that improve computation speed, stability and ease of implementation are produced. More specifically, the numerical part of the method is reduced to a solution of a nonlinear equation per system eigenvalue. The solution is obtainable through a variant of the (locally quadratically convergent) Newton method. For this method, easily computable starting values that guarantee convergence are given. In addition, explicit expressions for the eigenvectors are provided with the potentially unstable quantities factored-out. The paper also provides explicit and stably computable formulae for upper bounds to the coefficients of the spectral components, present in the expressions for the performance measures of interest. Moreover, the paper proves a partial ordering property for the system eigenvalues and presents an algorithm that performs full ordering on-line. This, in many cases, results in a great reduction to the amount of computation, without any significant loss of precision. Lastly, the particular case of heterogeneity where the differences are only identified in the rates within bursts is seen to have features resembling homogeneous systems. The possibility to substitute an ""equivalent"" homogeneous system of reduced order, for the original heterogeneous one is addressed. © 1994 J. C. Baltzer AG, Science Publishers...|$|R
40|$|Future B-ISDN {{networks}} {{will support}} {{a wide range}} of new multimedia services, whose characteristics are still mostly unknown. Among them the area of multimedia communications in medicine will result one of the most critical. This class of problems is furthermore complicated if we consider the requirements of teleradiology applications that involve the transmission of large amounts of data generated by <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>multiplexed</b> sources. The paper presents the analysis of the traffic collected during a typical teleradiology session over a broadband DQDB MAN offering a connection-less LAN-to-LAN interconnection service (such as SMDS). The study confirms the fractal nature of the source. The analysis of the collected data is used to validate a new approach for on-line self-similar traffic generation. On-line generators do not require any post-processing of the data and for this reason they are suitable to be used in discrete event block oriented simulation systems to evaluate network per [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation {{comparative study of}} some recent window-based high-speed TCP protocols (i. e. BIC and CUBIC) in large Bandwidth Delay Product (i. e. BDP) environment. It focuses particularly on long lived TCP transfer. We carry out simulation experiments extending the comparison between BIC and CUBIC [1]. In particular, we highlight further features of BIC and CU-BIC protocols in a lossy network environment. We show also RED AQM incidence on throughput performance. Two sets of simulation studies are conducted. The first one deals with multiplexed high-speed TCP pro-posals {{of the same kind}} (BIC or CUBIC) and on the same bottleneck link whereas the second one is concerned with <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>multiplexed</b> high-speed TCP propos-als (BIC and CUBIC). Throughput behaviors of different high-speed TCPs under different configurations are high-lighted with respect to network loss rate for Drop Tail (i. e. DT) and RED policies under Markovian and non Markovian loss distributions. We evaluate furthermore RED AQM algorithm impact both on link utilization and link bandwidth share between competing high-speed TCP proposals. Although the design and conception of each new proposal is achieved in order to enhance features such as scalability, friendliness, fairness and stability, we show, in this work, that this may not be done without some un-avoidable drawbacks.

30|$|Generally, it {{is vital}} for firms to balance path-dependent {{networks}} and calculative networks and to emphasize calculative networks at later stages. Start-ups’ network resources may furthermore be <b>heterogeneous</b> or <b>multiplex,</b> fostering reputation and market access, the sharing of knowledge, innovation, and technology transfer, and access to financial investors (Lechner and Dowling 2003; Pettersen and Tobiassen 2012). Zheng et al. (2010) argue that the more heterogeneous the networks are, the more diverse information and other resources the start-ups can acquire. Lechner et al. (2006) show that having different types of networks is more important for firm development than network size. Studies have also demonstrated that network heterogeneity helps high-tech start-ups to grow and prosper (Baum et al. 2000; Powell et al. 1996), and Zhao and Aram (1995) have shown that network breadth (and strength) was associated with start-up growth.|$|R
40|$|Green Small Cell Networks aim at {{achieving}} {{high rates}} and low powers by offloading users with low signal-to-noise-ratios from macrocell to the pico base station. In this work, we propose to jointly optimise energy efficiency (EE) and spectrum efficiency (SE) {{such that the}} network providers can dynamically tune the trade-off parameter for different design requirements. This paper formulates the EE-SE trade-off as a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP) in the uplink of multi-user two-tier Orthogonal Frequency Division <b>Multiplexing</b> <b>Heterogeneous</b> Networks. Using the weighted sum method, the MOP can {{be transformed into a}} single-objective optimisation problem (SOP). The proposed EE and SE trade-off optimisation problem is strictly quasi-concave. Hence, using Dual Decomposition approach, we derive the unique optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between EE and SE for different tradeoff parameters such as maximum transmission power and circuit power...|$|R
40|$|Admission {{control and}} {{bandwidth}} allocation are important issues in telecommunications networks, {{especially when there}} are random fluctuating demands for service and variations in the service rates. In the emerging broadband communications environment these services {{are likely to be}} offered via an ATM network. In order to make ATM future safe, methods for controlling the network should not be based on the characteristics of present services. We propose one bandwidth allocation method which has this property. Our proposed approach is based on pricing bandwidth to reflect network utilization, with users competing for resources according to their individual bandwidth valuations. The prices may be components of an actual tariff or they may be used as control signals, as in a private network. Simulation results show the improvement possible with our scheme versus a leaky bucket method in terms of cell loss probability, and confirm that a small queue with pricing can be efficient to <b>multiplex</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> sources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEmerging IT service {{providers}} that aim at delivering supercomputing power {{available to the}} masses over the Internet rely on high-performance IT resources interconnected with ultra-high-performance optical networks. To adjust the provisioning of the resources to end-user demand variations, new infrastructure capabilities have to be supported. These capabilities {{have to take into}} account the business requirements of telecom networks. This paper proposes a service framework to offer Internet {{service providers}} dynamic access to extensible virtual private execution infrastructures, through on-demand and in-advance bandwidth and resource reservation services. This virtual infrastructure service concept is being studied in the CARRIOCAS project and implemented thanks to the scheduling, reconfiguration, and virtualization (SRV) component. This entity handles the service requests, aggregates them, and triggers the provisioning of different types of resources accordingly. We propose to adapt to envisioned <b>heterogeneous</b> needs by <b>multiplexing</b> rigid and flexible requests as well as coarse or fine demands. The goal is to optimize both resource provisioning and utility functions. Considering the options of advanced network bandwidth reservations and allocations, the optimization problem is formulated. The impacts of the malleability factor are studied by simulation to assess the gain...|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{synchronization}} (ES) of {{coupled oscillators}} on networks {{is shown to}} be originated from existence of correlation between natural frequencies of oscillators and degrees of corresponding nodes. Here, we demonstrate that ES is a generic feature of multiplex network of second-order Kuramoto oscillators and can exist in absence of a frequency-degree correlation. A monoplex network of second-order Kuramoto oscillators bearing homogeneous (heterogeneous) degree-distribution is known to display the first-order (second-order) transition to synchronization. We report that multiplexing of two such networks having homogeneous degree-distribution support the first-order transition in both the layers thereby facilitating ES. More interesting is the multiplexing of a layer bearing heterogeneous degree-distribution with another layer bearing homogeneous degree-distribution, which induces a first-order (ES) transition in the heterogeneous layer which was incapable of showing {{the same in the}} isolation. Further, we report that such induced ES transition in the <b>heterogeneous</b> layer of <b>multiplex</b> networks can be controlled by varying inter and intra-layer coupling strengths. Our findings emphasize on importance of multiplexing or impact of one layer on dynamical evolution of other layers of systems having inherent multiplex or multilevel architecture.

40|$|This {{document}} is Closed Access. The demand for rapid screening technologies, {{to be used}} outside of a traditional healthcare setting, has been vastly expanding. This is requiring a new engineering platform for faster and cost effective techniques to be easily adopted through forward-thinking manufacturing procedures, i. e., advanced miniaturisation and heterogeneous integration of high performance microfluidics based point-of-care testing (POCT) systems. Although {{there has been a}} considerable amount of research into POCT systems, there exist tremendous challenges and bottlenecks in the design and manufacturing in order to reach a clinical acceptability of sensitivity and selectivity, as well as smart microsystems for healthcare. The project aims to research how to enable scalable production of such complex systems through 1) advanced miniaturisation of a physical layout and opto-electronic component allocation through an optimal design; and 2) <b>heterogeneous</b> integration of <b>multiplexed</b> fluorescence detection (MFD) for in vitro POCT. Verification is being arranged through experimental testing with a series of dilutions of commonly used fluorescence dye, i. e. Cy 5. Iterative procedures will be engaged until satisfaction of the detection limit, of Cy 5 dye, 1. 209 x 10 - 10 M. The research creates a new avenue of rapid screening POCT manufacturing solutions with a particular view on high performance and multifunctional detection systems not only in POCT, but also life sciences and environmental applications...|$|R
