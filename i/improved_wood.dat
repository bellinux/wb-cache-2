40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermarizburg, 2009. Persistent poverty, {{social and}} {{economic}} inequalities {{are some of the}} challenges in the process of national development efforts targeted in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Yet in South Africa, poverty, hunger, {{social and economic}} inequalities are still on the increase especially among poor rural to urban migrants. Because of severe poverty in rural areas, large populations of rural poor migrate to urban areas in search of better life. However, the growing energy needs in the urban areas where these people settle and their use of inefficient energy technologies negatively impact on the balance of environmental resources on which their socio-economic development depends. Efficient, affordable and environmental friendly technologies are therefore vital for improving the livelihood conditions and protecting the much needed environmental resources of the country. On the contrary, current practices presently dominating energy provision issues in South Africa are insufficient to solve the problems of socio-economic inequalities, especially for the increasing urban poor population. In addition, they are also failing to protect the environment and natural resources. Electrification of poor urban and peri-urban areas by both grid and off-grid systems through the top-down development practice is doing very little to change the socio-economic conditions of the poor section of the population in the country. Likewise, the provision of modern energy through public sector agencies such as Eskom is inadequate and inappropriate for the rapidly expanding urban and peri-urban poor areas in the country. One major reason that hinders provision of such services to the overcrowded consumer population in these areas is the massive capital investment required and inability to pay electricity bills by urban poor households. Against the above background, this study examined the use of <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> stoves in two peri-urban areas (Umsilinga and Isnathing) in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa as an alternative modern energy technology on how they would socio-economically benefit the peri-urban poor. It looked at the following: The efficiency of four <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> stoves (Yamampera, Simunye, Household Rocket and Vesto) in comparison with the three stone open fire, The impact of the efficient burning of the four improved stoves, Factors influencing consumers in choosing a specific energy technology to use, The effectiveness of the <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> stoves placed in 24 peri-urban households and observed for the specified period, and Additional potentials of such stoves to other prospective users. The key finding of this research is that the use of these <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> stoves could play a pivital role in household economic growth and improving livelihoods. Participants ranked smokeless burning, low selling price, fuelwood saving and light weight of the stoves as priority preferences for using these stoves. Speed of cooking and less constant attention to the fire were also ranked as important preferences. From women participants view point, the low selling price of the stoves and their considerable fuel saving would reduce strain on the household investment capital, household indoor pollution and tedious work of women’s fuelwood collection. Low investment costs in acquiring the stoves would encourage women’s participation as entrepreneurs in modern energy technologies. However, results from focused group discussions and observations of usage of stoves that were placed in 24 homes showed that the incorporation of consumer preferences in the design of <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> stoves would be key. This would enable stoves to adequately meet the energy needs of targeted users and be used frequently as an alternative energy solution by both urban and peri-urban poor who are currently lacking electricity and suffering from energy poverty...|$|E

This dissertation aims to estimate potential improvements in stem value through selection for improved stiffness. A new method to model and value volumes of structural wood grades within a stem was used to calculate these value improvements. Data for each stem from a stand in Kaingaroa Forest bred for <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> quality was used to perform this analysis. This data was from a stand bred for <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> quality and included information on the stiffness, density and width of each growth ring for each stem. The data was {{in the form of}} cores. Height and volume data was not recorded and therefore needed to be modelled. The volumes of MSG 8, MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood were estimated by modelling the stem volume at the age when wood is produced that is stiff enough to qualify for each grade. The majority of stems had merchantable volumes between 1 - 2. 5 m 3 with the largest stems containing 3. 6 m 3. Average stiffness ranged between 5. 2 GPa and 11. 3 GPa with the stand average being 8. 4 GPa. There was no relationship between average stiffness and merchantable volume. Stem values were found to range between $ 60 -$ 131 /m 3 with the stand average being $ 91 /m 3. The 10 most valuable stems had a total stem value ($ 318) twice that of the stand average ($ 157). The most valuable stem ($ 411) showed a 160 % increase in stem value from the average. The increases in value/m 3 were caused by large increases in the proportion of MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood held within the merchantable volume. These potential gains in stem value could help tree breeders assign an accurate economic weighting to stiffness improvements. Forest managers wanting to justify using a more expensive, improved stiffness seedlot may also find these results valuable...|$|E
30|$|Many wood {{properties}} are also under a moderate to {{high degree of}} genetic control, but these were often considered secondary traits in tree improvement programmes.

40|$|ABSTRACT There are {{currently}} in operation five major European industrial processes for wood thermal modification.

In fact, there is little research {{about the effect of}} thermal modification on wood resistance to termites, whether subterranean or dry-wood termites. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the Brazilian process of thermal modification (VAP HolzSysteme(r)) on the resistance of Eucalyptus grandis wood to attack by Cryptotermes sp. dry-wood termites. Five treatments were tested: untreated eucalypt wood, thermally modified eucalypt wood at three final temperatures (140, 160 and 180 °C) and pine wood (control). The attack was evaluated in terms of mass loss, mean score of wear grades, number of holes and termites mortality, according to a Brazilian method proposed by the Technological Research Institute of São Paulo.

Large wood veneer 700 × 700 mm specimens prepared with aspen (Populus tremuloides) were densified using heat, steam, and pressure at 160 ºC, 180 ºC, and 200 °C, respectively. OHT at 180 ºC, 200 ºC, and 220 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 h was then applied to the densified veneers. Results show that OHT efficiently improved dimensional stability and reduced compression set recovery. OHT temperature and duration markedly influenced the reduction of compression set recovery: the higher the OHT temperature and duration, the lower the recovery. Less than 5 % recovery was obtained under various OHT conditions, and almost 0 % recovery under some OHT conditions. Radial and tangential swellings of densified veneers were reduced dramatically. Compared to OHT duration, OHT temperature had a pronounced higher impact on radial and tangential swelling. Irreversible swelling (IS) in the compression direction of densified veneers decreased after OHT, particularly with high temperature and long duration, and anti-swelling efficiency (ASE) in the compression direction improved significantly...|$|R

40|$|Background: Wood cell {{walls are}} rich in cellulose, {{hemicellulose}} and lignin. Hence, they are important sources of renewable biomass for producing energy and green chemicals. However, extracting desired constituents from wood efficiently poses significant challenges because these polymers are highly cross-linked in cell walls and are not easily accessible to enzymes and chemicals. Results: We show that aspen pectate lyase PL 1 - 27, which degrades homogalacturonan and is expressed {{at the onset of}} secondary wall formation, can increase the solubility of wood matrix polysaccharides. Overexpression of this enzyme in aspen increased solubility of not only pectins but also xylans and other hemicelluloses, indicating that homogalacturonan limits the solubility of major wood cell wall components. Enzymatic saccharification of wood obtained from PL 1 - 27 -overexpressing trees gave higher yields of pentoses and hexoses than similar treatment of wood from wild-type trees, even after acid pretreatment. Conclusions: Thus, the modification of pectins may constitute an important biotechnological target for <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> processing despite their low abundance in woody biomass...|$|E

Analysis of RNA transcript abundance, enzyme activity, cell wall composition, and soluble carbohydrates revealed significant changes in the transgenic lines. All lines showed significantly increased SuSy enzyme activity in developing xylem. This activity manifested in altered secondary cell wall cellulose content per dry weight in all lines, with increases of 2 % to 6 % over control levels, without influencing plant growth. The elevated concentration of cellulose was associated with an increase in cell wall crystallinity but did not alter secondary wall microfibril angle. This finding suggests that the observed increase in crystallinity is a function of altered carbon partitioning to cellulose biosynthesis rather than the result of tension wood formation. Furthermore, the augmented deposition of cellulose in the transgenic lines resulted in thicker xylem secondary cell wall and consequently <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> density.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] Endogenous levels and signaling of gibberellin plant hormones such as gibberellic acid (GA) have been genetically down-regulated to create semi-dwarf varieties of poplar. The potential benefits of semi-dwarf stature include reduced risk of wind damage, improved stress tolerance, and <b>improved</b> <b>wood</b> quality. Despite these benefits, modification of growth traits may have consequences for non-target traits that confer defense against insect herbivores. According to the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, reductions in growth may shift allocation of carbon from growth to chemical resistance traits, thereby altering plant defense. To date, host-plant suitability and pest response have not been comprehensively evaluated in GA down-regulated plants. We quantified chemical resistance and nitrogen (an index of protein) in GA down-regulated and wild-type poplar (Populus alba × P. tremula) genotypes. We also evaluated performance of both generalist (Lymantria dispar) and specialist (Chrysomela scripta) insect pests reared on these genotypes. Our evaluation of resistance traits in four GA down-regulated genotypes revealed increased phenolic glycosides in one modified genotype and reduced lignin in two modified genotypes relative to the non-transgenic wild type. Nitrogen levels did not vary significantly among the experimental genotypes. Generalists reared on the four GA down-regulated genotypes exhibited reduced performance on only one modified genotype relative to the wild type.

A survey was conducted with a structured questionnaire for 210 households that were systematically selected from three rural kebeles which were selected purposively. Semi-structure interviews and focus group discussions were also held with a total of 9 key informants. Data from questionnaires were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression and data from interviews and the focus group discussions were analyzed through intensive textual analysis. The regression result reveals that women literacy level and separate kitchen house were found to be significant and positively correlated with the probability of Mirt stove adoption decision while marital status, source of wood and price of Mirt stove were found to be significant and negatively correlated with the probability of Mirt stove adoption decision. Furthermore, age and family size of the household characteristics were not found to be statistically significant. Providing services and supports to the potential users and producers, denying access to open forest and decentralizing Mirt stove production sites were found to be institutional factors to influence Mirt stove adoption. Membership in social associations, active participation in social activities, informal information exchange, early adopters and neighbors’ influence were found to be social factors that influence Mirt stove adoption.
