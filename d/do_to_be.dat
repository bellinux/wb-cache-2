25|$|His writing focus, {{as well as}} {{the focus}} of his life, turned to the problem of opium addiction. He {{described}} this as “one of my life’s ruling passions — a very agony of seeking to find — any means of bringing the habituated opium-eater out of his horrible bondage, without, or comparatively without, pain.” His essay What Shall They <b>Do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Saved from Harper’s was included in the 1868 book (written by Horace Day, himself a recovering addict) The Opium Habit, one of the first books to deal in a medical way with opium addiction, which had become a national crisis {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Ludlow expanded on his original essay with Outlines of the Opium Cure, a portrait in words of an ideal, perhaps utopian, drug addiction treatment clinic.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she is willing to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna {{shows up in the}} manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and it takes an effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that she could see Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her likes and dislikes.|$|E

500|$|According to Jan Delasara, one of {{the major}} themes of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] is the {{exploration}} of [...] "irresistible physical drives." [...] In Betts' case, his desire to kill is due to a biological need, not a malevolent desire to murder. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff, in his review of the episode, wrote that [...] "It also helps that Leonard's such an understandably human monster. On some level, he just wants to survive, and he's not happy about what he has to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to survive." [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] serves as the first story in a multi-season story-arc that features Agent Scully being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Richard Edwards, in the chapter [...] "Some Philosophical Reflections on 'Trust No One'" [...] of their book The Philosophy of The X-Files, argue that Scully withholding the knowledge of her cancer from Mulder is an example of psychological egoism in a protagonist. They reason that by not telling her partner, she is withholding the information in an act of self-interest.|$|E

She got the job. When she arrived at Idaho, the team had only one winning season in their first four years. Under VanDerveer, the team improved to 17–8 in the first year. The team won the first game of the season, beating the Northern Montana Skylights 80–78, which represented the first of VanDerveer's wins. The following year, the team improved to 25–6, which earned the team an invitation to the [...] AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament (the precursor to the NCAA National Championships).|$|E

2500|$|Although she was {{considered}} a blues singer during the pre-1925 period, Waters sang in the vaudeville style of Mamie Smith, Viola McCoy, and Lucille Hegamin. While with Columbia, she introduced many popular standards, including [...] "Dinah", [...] "Heebie Jeebies", [...] "Sweet Georgia Brown", [...] "Someday, Sweetheart", [...] "Am I Blue?" [...] and [...] "(What Did I <b>Do</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> So) Black and Blue" [...] on the popular series, while she continued to sing blues ("West End Blues," [...] "Organ Grinder Blues," [...] etc.) on Columbia's 14000 race series. During the 1920s, Waters performed and was recorded with the ensembles of Will Marion Cook and Lovie Austin. As her career continued, she evolved toward being a blues and Broadway singer, performing with artists such as Duke Ellington. She remained with Columbia through 1931. She signed with Brunswick Records in 1932 and remained until 1933, when {{she went back to}} Columbia. She signed with Decca Records in late 1934 for only two sessions, and later a single session in early 1938. She recorded for the specialty label Liberty Music Shop Records in 1935 and again in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gospel of}} John was written to Christians in exile after the {{destruction}} of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the Gentile Johannine community. John does not use the term [...] "repentance" [...] even once in the book, although he {{was familiar with the}} term (see John 20:30-31 and Revelation Chapter 2 and 3). Zane Hodges and Bob Wilkin hold that repentance is defined as turning from one's sins, but repentance is not a requirement for eternal life, only faith in Christ. Hodges takes the position in Absolutely Free! (and in more detail in Harmony With God) that the process of repentance may be a preparatory step in coming to salvation, and should be evident {{in the life of a}} believer, but a lost man can be born again apart from repentance by any definition. Hodges also says that he no longer holds to the change of mind view of repentance. In Harmony with God, Hodges says that there is only one answer to the question “What must I <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved?” [...] “Repentance is not part of that answer. It never has been and never will be.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent on one thing and that was to be successful and what you had to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
