25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success.

They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration,</b> Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
