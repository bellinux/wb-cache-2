40|$|The Students in Action Project in the School of Hospitality Management and Tourism was {{established}} in 2012 {{as a way of}} engaging students and working with stakeholders in a destination. The overall aim of the project was to immerse students in an active collaborative learning environment within the destination to identify ways in which tourism could be enhanced. In the 2014 / 2015 academic year the project involved over 300 students from a variety of programmes and modules working with local stakeholders in Wexford Town. To-date the project has been successful in its aims to develop staff, student and community engagement and has generated positive impacts in terms of lecturer and student collaborations and has also provided substantial outcomes for the destination. Going forward, while posing challenges in terms of <b>funding,</b> <b>timetabling</b> and logistical issues, the project provides extensive opportunities for further enhancement of student engagement and collaborative learning...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{infrastructure}} manager Trafikverket is <b>funding</b> research for <b>timetabling</b> optimization tools {{as part of}} their overall mission to utilize the existing infrastructure more efficiently. Currently, Trafikverket is modernizing both planning processes and the IT architecture, and will soon be ready to start using optimization tools on a broad scale. Meanwhile, innovative uses of a prototype developed at SICS have shown how a prototype does not necessarily merely serve to pave way for a future, large-scale implementation. This paper shows how computers in railway planning, coupled with OR techniques, relevant data and apt modeling, can help provide a future user with valuable insights even before the full-fledged tool is in place. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{physical}} fitness tests conducted at Caulfield Grammar School for the last nine years, 1969 – 1978. However concomitant with these results, other variables such as self esteem, academic performance etc, have been evaluated that perhaps show us that improving a person's level of fitness may also positively affect non-physical variables. It will not be my contention to justify physical education programmes on these grounds, because they need no other justification than that physical activity is a biological need and a pleasurable experience. But realistically it is the academics who control <b>funds,</b> staffing and <b>timetables,</b> so convincing these administrators that academic performance will not suffer from an increase in physical education time {{may have to be}} our tack...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} seven years, the number of plans with climate {{measures}} for tropical cities has increased 2. 3 times compared to the previous seven years {{as a result of}} the initiatives of central and local governments, multi-bilateral development aid and development banks. The plans matter in achieving the 11 th United Nations' Sustainable development goal. Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to ascertain the relevance and quality of climate planning in large and medium-sized cities in the Tropics. The chapter proposes and applies the QCPI-Quality of Climate Plans Index, consisting of 10 indicators (characterization of climate, number, quantification, relevance, potential impact, cost, <b>funding</b> sources, <b>timetable</b> and responsibility of measures, implementation monitoring and reporting). It is revealed that 338 tropical cities currently have a local development, emergency, master, mitigation, adaptation, risk reduction plan or a resilience or smart city strategy. These tools were unquestionably more common in large cities, especially in OCDE and BRICS countries, while they were rare in Developing Countries. Local development plans (Municipal development, general, comprehensive) were the most common in medium-sized cities, along with those with the lowest quality, while stand-alone strategies and plans (resilience, mitigation, sustainable, adaptation), applied mostly in big cities, present much higher quality...|$|R
40|$|Taking a constructivist-interpretivist stance, this mixed methods {{case study}} gives {{a voice to}} 236 {{children}} from east London between 2007 and 2010 {{through the use of}} questionnaires and interviews. The aim was to explore what the children thought about Physical Education, with a view to illuminating and informing current policy, practice and research in relation to the aims which under-pin the national curriculum. The children's voices, conspicuously absent from discussions about their physical education, over the last twenty years, give a view of the curriculum from the recipient's perspective. Through the vibrancy of their voices, the current status quo in primary PE is examined, and ways forward are offered as recurring themes throughout the thesis. In addition to valuing children's voices this thesis shows that through democratising the discussion, the children were more than just 'empty vessels', and were able to offer informed views. The children largely enjoyed Physical Education, valued their health and had ideas on curriculum content, <b>timetabling,</b> <b>fund</b> raising, and asked for a greater range of physical activities to be made available them...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{tensions}} within UK childcare {{policy and}} welfare reform. Through an ethnographic study of policy implementation, I examine themes of government, governance and governmentality. The evidence based policy movement {{assumes that the}} nature of evidence is self-evident but ethnographic data reveals how implementers draw on cultural resources of interpretive repertoires, myth and symbolism to make sense of policy. Central Government structures the policy implementation process with a “core offer”, hypothecated <b>funding,</b> a <b>timetable</b> and targets. Local policy actors manage implementation partly through tick box performative practices but they stretch time and juggle money. Implementation practices comprise branding, reification and commodification processes and the design of elastic policy products. Change and stasis are both in evidence with time-scales experienced variously as tight, as long running or as plus ça change. The community is produced as subject and object of governance, as an agent of change and a site for policy intervention. This glosses over childcare as women’s issue, market tensions and social class determinants of child poverty. Drawing on a range of theoretical resources and using the analogy of a palimpsest I show how discursive governance achieves a temporary policy settlement. This is neither workfare nor welfare but an unanticipated creative set of outcomes, exemplified in a circus project. I reveal some relatively hidden aspects of public policy and analyse give-away artefacts as hyper-visible policy manifestations. Commitment to a public service ethos is in evidence with policy implementers exercising their discretion in the interstices of market and state bureaucratic governance regimes. The Sure Start brand moves on from a flagship programme to Sure Start Children’s Centres but a novel Community Learning Partnership struggles to tug the oil tanker of children’s welfare services in a radically new direction or solve the wicked issue of child poverty...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the provision that students with dyslexia receive in Greek state secondary schools in EFL and if it corresponds with the Education Ministry’s policy on dyslexia. A study {{of the literature on}} dyslexia in Greece has shown that there is lack of teachers’ training on dyslexia and of teaching resources, collaboration between professionals and seminars for parents (Constantopoulou 2002; Arapogianni 2003; Lappas 1997). Taking a Vygotskian approach to learning, I apply activity theory (Engeström 2001) to understand and analyse the contradictions that inhibit the implementation of provision for students with dyslexia. This is an ethnographic case study involving audio recorded observations and interviews with two head teachers, three teachers, four students with dyslexia and their parents in two Greek state secondary schools. It also involves the collection of students’ work. The analysis shows that contradictions are created when the participants try to achieve their goals for dyslexia support by the lack of teachers’ knowledge and <b>funding,</b> the school <b>timetable,</b> the lack of inter-collegial collaboration and collaboration with parents and the inadequate diagnosis and school and Ministry’s policy. The analysis also shows how the participants try to resolve the contradictions by creating new objects and new tools through individual reflection...|$|R
40|$|Measurement is {{fundamental}} to research-related activities in social science (hence this Handbook). In my own field of education research, perhaps the most discussed element of education lies in test scores. Examination results are measurements, {{the number of students}} attaining a particular standard in a test is a measurement; indeed the standard of a test is a measurement. The allocation of places at school, college or university, student:teacher ratios, <b>funding</b> plans, school <b>timetables,</b> staff workloads, adult participation rates, and the stratification of educational outcomes by sex, social class, ethnicity or geography for example, are all based on measurements. Good and careful work has been done in all of these areas (Nuttall 1987). However, the concept of measurement itself remains under-examined, and is often treated in an uncritical way. In saying this I mean more than the usual lament about qualitative:quantitative schism or the supposed reluctance of social scientists to engage with numeric analysis (Gorard et al. 2004 a). I mean that even where numeric analysis is being conducted, the emphasis is on collecting, collating, analysing, and reporting the kinds of data generated by measurement, with the process of measurement and the rigor of the measurement instrument being somewhat taken for granted by many commentators. Issues that are traditionally considered by social scientists include levels of measurement, reliability, validity, and the creation of complex indices (as illustrated in some of the chapters contained in this volume). But these matters are too often dealt with primarily as technical matters – such as how to assess reliability or which statistical test to use with which combination of levels of measurement. The process of quantification itself is just assumed'...|$|R
40|$|Using Margaret Archer’s social realist methodology, {{this study}} {{critically}} examines {{the construction of}} the tutorial system in several departments and faculties at the Auckland Park campus of the University of Johannesburg. The purpose of the study is to investigate the extent to which tutorials support the acquisition of programme and disciplinary epistemologies. Social realism calls for analytical dualism of ‘the people’ (agents) from ‘the parts’ (structure and culture). This requires the separate consideration of structures (social systems, rules, roles, practices, policies, institutions, and organisational structures like committees, units, departments, faculties), culture (ideologies, theories, beliefs and values as evidenced in discourses), and agency (people and their ability to act within and upon their own world in terms of their social roles and positions dependent on their ability to activate their emergent properties and powers). Through this investigation, an understanding was gained into how the emergent properties and powers contained within the material, ideational and agential elements helped to generate certain events and practices in the tutorial system. These generative mechanisms were examined to explore whether they enabled or constrained {{the construction of the}} tutorial system to provide epistemological access. The study shows that while many official policy documents construct the tutorial system as being an intervention to support academic success, particularly for first-years, there are some tensions within the document discourses, where, on the one hand, student success is constructed in terms of throughput numbers, or, on the other hand, as being about becoming a particular kind of person who is able to access and add to powerful knowledge. Furthermore, the study found that policies are not being consistently implemented. While certain key agents and actors, in the form of management, academics and tutors, were found to be able to overcome constraints and introduce innovative ways of enhancing access to target epistemologies, {{there is a need for}} consideration of structural and cultural constraints. For example, structures in the form of <b>funding,</b> venues and <b>timetabling</b> were found to constrain the tutorial system as did some of the discourses in the cultural domain: for example, in the form of certain dominant discourses around teaching and learning, beliefs about the purpose of the tutorial and the relationship between academics and the tutorial system. The study also found that the ontological aspects of ‘learning to be’ were not fore-grounded to any great extent in the ways in which the tutorial system was constructed. There needs to be more consideration of the ontological as well as the epistemological aspects of first-year study so as to take cognisance of the different learning needs of an increasingly diverse student body and to encourage the development of the student agency necessary for a deep engagement with the disciplinary epistemologies...|$|R
