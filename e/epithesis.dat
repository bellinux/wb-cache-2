40|$|Maxillofacial defect {{caused by}} cancer {{treatment}} represents a problem affecting {{the quality of}} life of patients. Epithethic solutions are indicated if plastic surgery reconstruction is not a valid option for an extensive defect. We present the case of a 42 years-old woman, who had undergone a total nasal resection, for a well-differentiated epidermoid carcinoma of the tip of the nose. The anatomopathologic analysis of the piece of resection showed free margins, and did not reveal any ganglionar metastasis. No radiotherapy was applied. Three months later, four extraoral implants were placed in the frontal and paranasal areas with a transcutaneous approach, in order to avoid crusting resulting from trans-nasal mucosa emergence of the fixtures. After four months, each implant as a bone anchorage was connected with a prosthetic retention device to be connected to the nasal epithese. After four weeks, cutaneous healing allowed the prosthetic steps to be achieved. The use of extraoral fixtures as bone anchorage for a nasal <b>epithesis</b> represents an alternative to more heavy and time-consuming surgical reconstruction techniques. Another advantage is that the site can be monitored easily because the <b>epithesis</b> is removable, as for the carcinologic follow-up. It allows a good retention of the nasal <b>epithesis</b> and an esthetic result which is satisfying for the patient.

30|$|Approximately 4  weeks after healing {{abutment}} connection, intraoral defect including implant abutment and extraoral paranasal defect impressions were taken. The technician managed {{two different}} casts: one cast for nasal wax up and one cast for dental wax up. Superior implant bar supported by [4] zygoma implants was designed crossing the palatal defect {{in order to}} manufacture palatal obturator at a second time. Furthermore, two metal abutments were lodged and fused on the cranial surface of the bar {{in order to receive}} <b>epithesis</b> attachments. The abutments acted as primary crowns and secondary crowns, press-fitted on abutments and were used to take an extraoral position impression of the abutments using the nasal wax up as an individual. In this way, the technician could connect OTK (Ball abutment) attachments on the internal surface of the <b>epithesis</b> and thanks to secondary crowns, the nasal prosthesis can be removed for prosthetic aftercare and follow-up inspections. OTK attachments are commonly used because of their retention in overdenture prosthetic rehabilitation. The female part of this peculiar type of ball attachment is made out of Teflon™ (politetrafluoroetilene) while the male part consisted of a titanium structure. A complete implant-supported bar with two bolt prosthesis was made in order to provide superior arch rehabilitation. At the time of delivery, the palatal defect was closed by a soft base material. The nasal <b>epithesis</b> was made of silicone with an acrylic resin internal plate hosting female OTK attachments, whereas male parts were on the secondary crowns.|$|E

40|$|AB The {{prosthetic}} rehabilitation is {{a surgical}} alternative in functional-aesthetic facial reconstruction when the conventional reconstructive surgery cannot be applied {{either because of}} the psychophysical conditions of the patient or because of an excessive substance loss. From May 2002, 35 facial prosthesis (111 implants) have been positioned. Defects were congenital (N = 12), consequent to trauma (N = 8) and to demolitive surgery for malignant tumors (N= 8), and infection (N = 7). In 4 patients, implants were placed in previously irradiated areas. A total of 111 titanium implants were placed to support 21 auricular prostheses (bilateral in 2 cases), 4 orbital prostheses, 8 nasal prostheses, and 2 complex midfacial prostheses. Implant failure was observed for 2 of the 3 implants placed to support a nasal <b>epithesis</b> in a patient with hepatitis C virus, with an important parodontal disease, who experienced a postinfective necrosis of the nose after a liver transplantation; {{it was necessary to}} place an adhesive prosthesis.

In cases of subtotal ablation, an rn method designed especially for elderly oncological patients consists of epithetic rehabilitation. However, inserting an implant-retained concha <b>epithesis</b> proves challenging {{in patients with}} antecedents of deep resections involving the mastoid process. In the present case study, {{we report on the}} long-term treatment course (2009 – 2017) of a 79 -year-old male patient suffering from a recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the retroauricular region. Following tumor resection, along with lateral mastoidectomy, reconstruction, and adjuvant radiotherapy, functional and esthetic deficits primarily due to peripheral facial nerve palsy were successfully managed using a multistep ed The procedure was completed by inserting an implant-retained concha <b>epithesis,</b> resulting in improved quality of life. Due to prior lateral mastoidectomy, ultra-short implants (4 mm) were inserted, partially at atypical positions. For maintaining healthy periimplant soft tissue, aftercare comprised cold plasma treatment. This oncologic case demonstrates the therapeutic necessity of using a broad spectrum of reconstructive procedures, along with their limitations, in a critical anatomic region. Specific features include the presentation of a workflow using ultra-short implants in a compromised mastoid region. Surgeons should consider alternative implant positions in the event of any compromised mastoid process. A particular emphasis has been put on meticulous aftercare to preserve healthy periimplant soft tissues...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} bony integrated implants used {{in the management of}} exenterated or contracted sockets. Materials and Methods: Ten eyes of 10 cases underwent bony integrated implants for the management of exenterated (7 eyes) or contracted (3 eyes) sockets. The procedure was performed in two steps in a two-month period. The first step included placement of screws by preparing the osteotomy site, whereas the second step included implantation of magnetic implants over these screws that will adhere to the orbital implant. The patients were retrospectively evaluated for age, gender, etiology, surgical timing, history of radiotherapy, and time of application of <b>epithesis.</b> The presence of infection at the surgical site, implant loss, functional or cosmetic problems at the perisurgical area, the usage of <b>epithesis</b> during the social life were evaluated. Results: There were 7 female and 3 male patients. The mean age was 34 (5 - 75) years. The indications for enucleation or exenteration were: retinoblastoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (2 cases), basal cell carcinoma (1 case), squamous cell carcinoma (1 case), rhabdomyosarcoma (1 case) and sinoorbital mucormycosis (1 case). The epitheses were applied 3 to 156 months (mean 51 months) following the intervention. All of the implantations were performed successfully. During follow-up, one case had lost the implant and one case had local infection that responded to antibiotic treatment. Three cases were reoperated and the implants were replaced after a 2 -year follow-up time due to the deterioration of the magnetic effect of the implants. Conclusion: Bony integrated orbital implants have an important role in solution of esthetic problems encountered in the exenterated orbit and severe contracted socket.

40|$|Reconstruction of {{composite}} orbital defects {{must address}} the orbit and an exposed skull base and/or maxillary region.

This study presents a rationale for a near-anatomical reconstruction of the orbit, together with adjacent dead space obliteration, using the segmentalized osteo-fascia-cutaneous fibula flap. Before the flap transfer, a cutting template for the fibula is made according to the measures and requirements of the facial defect. The segmentalized bone is then osteosynthesized to the facial skeleton and revascularized. Thus, an orbital depth is created by the bony fibula, whereas the fascio-cutaneous part of the flap {{may be used for}} lining the orbit and obliteration of the skull base or the maxillary region, or resurface the palate and/or the nasal cavity...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} case of a 14 -year-old patient {{suffering}} from first branchial arch syndrome with agenesia of the auricle in which the auricle was reconstructed using osteointegrated implants.

In order to ensure an accurate preoperative evaluation, the patient was studied using CT with a standard technique and three-dimensional image reconstruction for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of bone thickness so as to allow the optimal positioning of fixtures. This test also revealed the existence and good degree of development of the middle and internal ear. The Authors then proceeded to implant 4 titanium fixtures into the mastoid process of the temporal bone, three of which were used for fixing the auricle prosthesis and one for the insertion of a bone anchored hearing aid.

40|$|Although {{the benefit}} of extra-oral {{implants}} in the reconstruction of maxillofacial oncological defects is undisputable, some relevant issues need to be clarified. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the relationship between implants placed during ablation (DA-implants) and after ablation (AA-implants) of the tumor with respect to implant survival. In total, 103 implants were assessed: 44 nasal implants (17 patients) and 59 orbital implants (18 patients). All patients received their implant-retained maxillofacial <b>epithesis</b> between 1997 and 2010, with a mean follow-up of 35 months (range 8 - 156 months).

40|$|Summary: Conjunctival {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) arising from an anophthalmic socket is quite rare, with few reports in the English literature. A 59 -year-old man who had used an ocular prosthesis for 40 years had not removed the ocular prosthesis at all during the last 5 years. He had developed a mass on his entire right upper eyelid, and biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated SCC. Orbital exenteration including {{the upper and lower}} eyelid skin was performed. The defect was reconstructed with a free forearm flap followed by the placement of a facial <b>epithesis.</b> The pathology revealed an intraepithelial carcinoma on the upper palpebral conjunctiva, which seemed to infiltrate exclusively from that site to the upper eyelid and into the orbit. Other risk factors were not detected; therefore, chronic irritation or microtrauma of the upper conjunctiva from the prosthesis due to persistent prosthesis placement could have been the main trigger for the development of SCC. In cases where the ocular prosthesis is not fitted properly or removed appropriately, clinicians should be aware of this possible long-term consequence...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} malignant disease in women. The loss of a breast is a highly traumatizing event for the woman; thus, surgical or non-surgical methods of reconstruction can improve quality of life. In the present study, we aimed to assess patient satisfaction with two different models of adhesive external breast prosthesis and to compare them with the previously worn models. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 240 women {{using one of the}} two prosthesis models. 154 questionnaires were returned, 41 of which were not eligible for evaluation. Most items were rated on a verbal scale (VRS). Results: After a prosthesis-free period of about 4. 5 years, the women wore both models of the “Silima direct” for almost 2 years. The assessment of both models was mainly positive. The average VRS scores were just above 2 out of 5 points, which corresponds to a “good” rating. The lighter model scored better results. Of the patients, 73. 6 % were overall at least “satisfied” with the lighter model as compared to 58. 3 % with the model of normal weight. In comparison with the Amoena adhesive <b>epithesis</b> and other prosthesis models worn previously, the “Silima direct” and particularly the light model was perceived to be better in almost all criteria. Conclusion: External adhesive breast prostheses are a valuable method of post-mastectomy rehabilitation, which improves quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Background The authors {{present their}} {{experience}} {{with the use of}} extraoral implants for reconstruction of the ear area after burns. The first step of the protocol includes positioning of implants in the mastoid process. The second step, after 3 to 4 months, is to realize the auricle prosthesis and apply it. Extraoral, bone-integrated implants offer low surgical risks and few postsurgical complications, leading to optimal aesthetic results, mainly in the ear area. Compared with traditional surgery techniques, the aesthetic results are better, with less surgery, possibly only two surgery sessions. Adhesive prostheses can be placed without the usual local irritation, and a more correct positioning can be obtained. Methods For this study, two female patients, treated from December 2001 to January 2005, were selected to receive auricle epitheses. In the authors' experience, 79 % of case reporting describes the creation of this <b>epithesis</b> type. The patient age has a range of 26 years. The two study patients initially had the same diagnosis: burns of the auricle-temporal region. Results In all cases, a good aesthetic result was obtained. Conclusions The authors believe that bone-anchored implants for the treatment of auricle burns is a valid and brilliant technique that complements traditional reconstructive procedures. The advantages are the low incidence of long-term complications and the possibility of obtaining excellent aesthetic lasting results even for very complicated cases {{that would not have been}} solved in the past...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the oral {{health-related}} {{quality of life}} of 18 patients (13 men and 5 women) was evaluated using validated questionnaires as proposed by the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The patients belonged to a cohort of 48 patients, whose prosthetic treatment was performed during the years 2004 - 2007. In the course of tumor resection, 12 patients underwent graft surgery and 14 patients radiotherapy. One patient required a nasal <b>epithesis</b> since resection of the nose became necessary. Five patients underwent a full block resection of the mandible, and tumor resection in 3 patients resulted in a large oronasal communication. Prosthetic rehabilitation was performed in all patients, and the follow-up period with regular care covered a minimum of 3 years. Eleven patients received dental implants for better support and retention of the prostheses. In spite of compromised oral conditions, functional restrictions, and some difficulties with the prostheses, the answers to the questionnaire were quite positive. The majority judged their general health as good or even excellent. The subjective perception of the patients may contradict the objective view by the dentist. In fact, the individual patient's history and experience provide {{a better understanding of the}} impact of oral tumors on daily life.

40|$|Breast {{carcinoma}} is {{at present}} {{one of the}} most frequent diseases of women which affects all areas of woman ´s life and becomes all-society problem. It is an oncology disease which brings a woman and her close relatives a huge psychical and physical stress. One of the possibilities to cure the breast cancer is the chirurgical removal of the whole breast (mastectomy), which is a huge change not only in woman ´s social life. The thesis gives information on breast carcinoma, risk factors for the onset of the disease, clinical symptoms, diagnostics and the treatment of breast carcinoma. Further, it describes the possibilities of reconstruction therapy, rehabilitation and psycho- social effects of cancer. The objective of the thesis was to find out if and how mastectomy influences the social life of women. For the data elaboration the method of quantitative research by means of questioning was used. The questionnaires were addressed to women with breast carcinoma after mastectomy. The research group was created by the clients of General Faculty Hospital in Prague. The questionnaires were anonymous and voluntary, in the form of 25 closed and semi-open questions. Hypothesis H 1 : negative influence of mastectomy depends on the partner ´s attitude and the family support, was proved. Hypothesis H 2 : mastectomy negatively influences single women and women without children, was also proved. Hypothesis H 3 : women after mastectomy are of worsened occupational use, was disproved. The research has shown that the question of solving social issue in women after mastectomy is more and more up- to-date. Average age of respondents is 51 - 60 years. In the question concerning the change of life in women after mastectomy were most frequently mentioned the problems with the change in dressing, sport activities and psychical problems.

Summary and conclusion. For {{the past two}} decades, great efforts {{have been made in}} the systemic functional description of English and many other languages including Chinese at the clause level. However, very few descriptive work has been done at the group/phrase level. As an attempt to fill in the gap, this thesis extends the lexicogrammatical study to the level of nominal groups, focusing on Mandarin Chinese in particular. Drawing upon a corpus of 180 quality texts of different text types, the investigation is heavily text-based: the nominal groups are observed in the environment of clauses, sentences, paragraphs and texts in contexts. The description of Chinese nominal groups is unfolded on the basis of Halliday’s metafunctional model, exploring the metafunctional resources that Chinese nominal groups provide in realising the three strands of meaning: ideational (including logical and experiential), interpersonal and textual meanings. Through the investigation of each metafunction, some important systems within the nominal group are presented, which provide selections in realising the metafunctional meanings. In terms of logical metafunction, the system of MODIFICATION is presented. In terms of experiential metafunction, the systems presented include THING TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, <b>EPITHESIS,</b> QUALIFICATION, and MEASURE. In terms of interpersonal metafunction, the system of PERSON is introduced. And finally, in terms of textual metafunction, the exploration includes the system of NAMING, the system of IDENTIFICATION, and the system of NUMERATION. Major selections on each of these systems are discussed in detail, with examples demonstrating the potential lexicogrammatical choices. Apart from the exploration of the systems, another focus of the study is on the potential application of the findings to other areas. For this purpose, at the end of each metafunctional exploration, a case study involving different types of texts is presented, demonstrating the significance of nominal groups in their contributions to the metafunctional meanings. The case studies are designed to explore different issues in relation to the use of nominal groups, including the modification structure of the nominal groups and its relation with text types (in the logical exploration), the experiential environment of Thing type choices in different types of texts (in the experiential exploration), the choice of nominal groups in enacting different attitudes (in the interpersonal exploration), and challenges of cohesion and coherence in machine translation presented by nominal groups (in the textual exploration). Through in-depth metafunctional exploration of the nominal gorups, as well as illustrative case studies, this research is expected to contribute to the development of language typology in Systemic Functional Linguistics, as well as other areas including delicate discourse analysis, the study of Chinese language, and machine translation research.
