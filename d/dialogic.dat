5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced <b>dialogic</b> prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E

25|$|Panagiotis Soutsos, {{along with}} his brother, was the {{originator}} of romanticism in poetry and prose of the First Athenian School with his poem The Wayfarer (Ὁ Ὁδοιπόρος) in 1831 and his novel Leander (Ὁ Λέανδρος) in 1834. The Wayfarer is a <b>dialogic</b> poem with a dramatic form but no scenic intention. The story revolves around the love between two young people, the Wayfarer and Rallou, which is presented in accordance with romantic motifs; a love that is met with various obstacles and which, ultimately unfulfilled, brings both protagonists to death. Central to the poem are themes of distraction, religion, and heartbreak. Soutsos kept editing the poem throughout his life, and every edition (1842, 1851, 1864) contained an increasingly archaic form of Greek, whereas his first edition was written in plain Katharevousa. Overall, Soutsos' poems are dominated by the lyric and elegiac tone, with the main subjects being religion, love and freedom, and all influenced by French Romanticism.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much <b>dialogic</b> 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
500|$|The novel's first 100 pages {{deal with}} the bridge's {{construction}} and the remaining 200 revolve around the Austro-Hungarian period. Andrić himself characterized The Bridge on the Drina as a chronicle rather than a novel. In the introduction to his English-language translation, Edwards also declined to classify it as a novel, for [...] "its scope is too vast, its characters too numerous, its period of action too long." [...] Literary scholar Annabel Patterson writes: [...] "There is no hero or heroine to hold it together, nor even a family or dynasty. In place of these there is the bridge, whose birth we attend, whose stability we come to count on." [...] Patterson hesitates to characterize The Bridge on the Drina as a historical novel {{because most of the}} events described in it actually occurred as opposed to having been fictionalized. She notes that other scholars have classified it as a [...] "non-fiction novel", a term she considers superfluous. [...] "If we wish for simplicity," [...] she writes, [...] "we can call The Bridge on the Drina a novel to distinguish it from Andrić's collections of short stories. But if we wish for precision, The Bridge on the Drina can best be classified as {{a collection of short stories}} of peasant life held together by a bridge." [...] The book deviates from other texts that have been described as chronicles in that the narrator observes events itinerantly and retrospectively. The style of storytelling Andrić employs is often likened to a transcendent historical monologue. Literary scholar Guido Snel believes that such a stylistic interpretation neglects the novel's <b>dialogic</b> properties and its ability to act as a back-and-forth between the narrator and reader, drawing a connection between the past described in the novel and the reader's present. This has caused Serb scholars to uphold Andrić's narrative authority, Snel writes, and Muslim scholars to challenge and reject it.|$|E

To describe dialogical phenomenology we turn to three resources: (a) " Chinese intellectual traditions, (b) dreams and (c) daily life. J Dialogical attributes are described: the dialogical self is capable of- ^ polyvocality but also of achieving unity with diversity; metacognition is vital to its development. We attempt to clarify the relation between <b>dialogics</b> and dialectics: The dialogical self is capable of taking an active part in the interaction between inner and outer dialectics, and hence of participating in its own creation and transformation. Finally, we illustrate how the study of dialogical movements may be operationalized...|$|R

40|$|The paper re–contextualizes Marek Siemek´s transcendentalist {{approach}} to the reciprocal recogniton in new contexts (phenomenology and hermeneutics) The paper examines the evolution of Marek Siemek’s “dialogical principle. ” The early version of this principle, sketched in the essay “Dialogue and Its Myth” (1974), meets several criteria of the phenomenology of dialogue and even hermeneutics. How- ever, Siemek has continued to change his concept of dialogue over the decades. In his recent book, Freedom, Reason, Intersubjectivity (2002), he explores transcendental preconditions of free and reasonable activism, i. e., the Fichtean “limitative synthesis” of I and Non-I and its applications in social interrelations. He no longer considers the em- pirical, anthropological, and phenomenological aspects of <b>dialogics</b> and mutual recognition. He also replaces mutuality with reciprocity, asymmetry with symmetry, and phe- nomenology with transcendentalism. NPRH no. 1 bH 15 0416 8...|$|R
40|$|Each {{communication}} act is translation. There {{is a need}} of transposing {{from the}} level of thinking {{to the level of}} words or transposing between the means of expression or between languages. To demonstrate the process of translating we have chosen the poetry of Ana Maria Fagundo, a poet from the Canary Islands. We believe that the relationship between a reader/writer and a text can exist at the same level as the relationship between people. After having presented the most important philosophies of dialogue of the twentieth century (Buber, Nedoncelle, Gadamer, Scheler, Gusdorf) we have observed the development of the attitude of Ana Maria Fagundo toward the poetic word. She uses the word in her early poems to identify herself with the word and to explain the reality around her. Then in her last book El sol, la sambra, en el instants she enters the full dialogue with the word. We have talked about the dialectics {{of the relationship between the}} poet and the word, among others: polilogue, meeting, integration, co-creation. The dialectics of the dialogue bring new insight to translation studies. We have analyzed the results of the trilingual survey (Spanish, English, Polish) about the perception of two poems of Ana Maria Fagundo. We have tried to understand the process of interaction between a translator/interpreter and a text/enunciation. We believe that the awareness of constant <b>dialogics</b> in a process of translation, described in our studies as a distanciation and a creative communion, can help to elaborate strategies in order to improve translating/interpreting technics. Another interesting example of the <b>dialogics</b> in the poetry of Ana Maria Fagundo is the dialogue of contradictions. The study of the oxymoron demonstrates the similarity between the interverbal relationships in a text and the relationships between people. The understanding of the reader/writer dialogical meeting with the word makes us aware of how important the factor of mutual influence is in the translating and interpreting labor. ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Dialogic</b> Imagination (first {{published}} {{as a whole}} in 1975) is a compilation of four essays concerning language and the essay: [...] "Epic and Novel" [...] (1941), [...] "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" [...] (1940), [...] "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" [...] (1937–1938), and [...] "Discourse in the Novel" [...] (1934–1935). It is through the essays contained within The <b>Dialogic</b> Imagination that Bakhtin introduces the concepts of heteroglossia, dialogism and chronotope, making {{a significant contribution to}} the realm of literary scholarship. Bakhtin explains the generation of meaning through the [...] "primacy of context over text" [...] (heteroglossia), the hybrid nature of language (polyglossia) and the relation between utterances (intertextuality). Heteroglossia is [...] "the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any utterance." [...] To make an utterance means to [...] "appropriate the words of others and populate them with one's own intention."

Even when tie-in merchandise for the Disney-Burton film is subversive of mainstream Disney aesthetics and ideologies, Disney and its licensed tie-in merchandising affiliates engage in rhetoric {{and practices that}} reincorporate dispersed and contesting intertexts, producing a portmanteau of ‘tie-intertextuality’.

40|$|Women {{operating}} as scholars and agents {{of social and}} cultural change in late-Victorian Britain succeeded through their persistence and active engagement in changing and contested social and cultural fields. This paper addresses aspects of the life and work of journalist, activist and scholar, Charlotte Carmichael Stopes (1841 - 1929). Specifically, the paper provides a discussion of correspondence from Constance and Oscar Wilde between 1888 and 1890, regarding Stopes' publication submissions to the Rational Dress Gazette and the Woman's World, and refers to the <b>dialogics</b> of voice, identity and authorship at work in this context. The view that the literary interventions of late nineteenth-century female writers - particularly writers of scholarly interpretation - were often positioned outside the established public sphere of letters and ideas, characterised as inconsequential (Robinson, xi), or in terms of 'threatening otherness' (Schwab, xi-xv) is also explored.
