25|$|An {{important}} physical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked is {{the separation of}} duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example: an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not {{also be able to}} authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the server administrator or the <b>database</b> <b>administrator</b> – these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.|$|E
25|$|Locks can {{be applied}} on {{different}} levels of granularity—on entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis on tables. For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the <b>database</b> <b>administrator.</b> While a fine-grained locking system allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources, so it does not automatically yield higher performance. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight mutual exclusion solutions—latches and spinlocks—which are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks {{to ensure that they}} do not end up in deadlocks—in case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases are to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and roll back the transaction it started. To implement locking, SQL Server contains the Lock Manager. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it.|$|E

[...] Employees have taken PINs and loaded or traded them for their own purposes. [...] Meanwhile victims have their claims investigated by the company ITC Financial Licenses under InComm, with a very broken model which blames victims as participants in Victim Assisted Fraud. [...] The extent of this situation is not yet known, but a victim with a small blog was able to find $5000 in victims while researching his own case to ultimately prove this. [...] A video reveals a PIN number being known before silvering has been scratched off, and the victim was able to trace the account one of the cards was loaded to back to a former InComm <b>Database</b> <b>Administrator.</b>|$|E

The ERP Solutions Delivery Team handles Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing, Real-time Version 3 (SAP R/ 3) support and BASIS (SAP R/ 3 kernel) support; Database Delivery team handles database support for DB 2, Oracle, Sybase, Informix and several smaller relational database environments. The Oracle databases are running in a SAP environment, so <b>database</b> <b>administrators</b> must be technically proficient in SAP as well as Oracle. Training will be a continual, expensive problem for these two teams, especially for the Enterprise Resource Planning Solutions Delivery Team since the DBAs are geographically dispersed. A solution to handle mentoring, collaborating and maintaining skills anytime, anyplace, any pace for SAP R/ 3 <b>database</b> <b>administrators</b> was a very high priority. Lotus Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM, recently announced its Learning Space was industry 2 ̆ 7 s first instructor-led, collaborative distance learning solution with Web access. A Web-based prototype for collaborative learning, mentoring and maintaining skills was a viable solution for geographically dispersed, mobile <b>database</b> <b>administrators.</b> The problem to be solved in this study was the lack of effective collaboration among SAP R/ 3 <b>database</b> <b>administrators</b> that are located in different geographical areas. Without this collaboration, work on critical tasks was problematic. Geographically dispersed <b>database</b> <b>administrators</b> must work from a distance that precludes daily face-to-face meetings with other <b>database</b> <b>administrators.</b> Solving this problem was critical to successful implementation and maintenance of SAP databases. The Internet was selected as the way to increase collaboration and overcome the associated dysfunction among geographically dispersed <b>database</b> <b>administrators</b> working on SAP Rl 3 projects. The collaboration would include mentoring, maintaining skill levels, sharing documentation, sharing work procedures and techniques, sharing run procedures and policies, and collaborative problem repositories. Expectations were this collaborative prototype would reduce costs and raise productivity of dispersed Systems SAP R/ 3 <b>database</b> <b>administrators.</b> The prototype would supplement the cost of corporate education and bring IBM Global Services South (IGSS) cost of doing business to lower levels...|$|R
