5|$|The {{separate}} pronouns {{have both}} a {{short and long}} form that are used for <b>emphatic</b> and normal pronouns respectively. Examples of the <b>emphatic</b> form include: emmë, elyë, entë (1st to 3rd person plural). Such <b>emphatic</b> disjunctive pronouns, were already present in early Quenya but differed from the later versions (e.g. plural: tûto, sîse, atta).|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{interrogative}} pronouns and adverbs {{frequently have}} the <b>emphatic</b> pronoun dash fused {{with them to}} form a single word. In this table the <b>emphatic</b> pronoun is written as -sh immediately following the main word.|$|E
5|$|Pietro Colonna {{and three}} bishops brought {{the news of}} Morrone's {{election}} to his mountain-top hermitage. Contemporary sources are <b>emphatic</b> in noting Morrone's reluctance to accept his election; for example, Petrarch recounts his attempt to flee.|$|E
50|$|Such {{dissimilation}} is {{more likely}} if the <b>emphatics</b> were glottalized.|$|R
5000|$|The law usually {{pertains}} to inherited Proto-Semitic roots whose <b>emphatics</b> were usually dissimilated. Compare: ...|$|R
5000|$|In modern Semitic languages, <b>emphatics</b> are {{variously}} realized as pharyngealized (Arabic, Aramaic, Tiberian Hebrew (such as [...] ), glottalized (Ethiopian Semitic languages, Modern South Arabian languages such as [...] ), or as unaspirated (Turoyo of Tur-Abdin such as [...] ); Ashkenazi Hebrew and Maltese {{are exceptions}} and all <b>emphatics</b> merge into plain consonants {{under the influence}} of Indo-European languages (Italian/Sicilian for Maltese, German/Yiddish for Hebrew).|$|R
5|$|Various changes, {{mostly in}} morphology, {{took place between}} Proto-Semitic and Proto-Central-Semitic, the {{language}} {{at the root of}} the Central Semitic languages. The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged, but the <b>emphatic</b> consonants may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from ejectives to pharyngealized consonants.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Tasmania was {{not part}} of Sheffield Shield, and Harvey made his Shield debut against New South Wales. He was {{dismissed}} without scoring in the first innings before making 49 in the second innings in an <b>emphatic</b> 298-run win over their arch-rivals. Victoria {{went on to win the}} title convincingly.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, <b>emphatic</b> beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
2500|$|In Burkina Faso the <b>emphatics</b> are {{denoted by}} [...] "hooked" [...] letters, as in Fula, e.g[...]|$|R
2500|$|The letter [...] is {{used for}} [...] only when it {{contrasts}} with [...] (e.g. ṛwiɣ [...] "I am satisfied" [...] vs. rwiɣ [...] "I am moved"). In all other cases [...] is used, e.g. tarakna [...] "carpet" [...] (pronounced taṛakna). This is because [...] is often an allophone of [...] in the environment of other <b>emphatics,</b> and it rarely contrasts with [...] otherwise. Exceptional cases of other <b>emphatics,</b> e.g. [...] "hound", are ignored (i.e. written as uccay).|$|R
50|$|Ancient Aramaic {{may have}} had a larger series of <b>emphatics,</b> and some Neo-Aramaic {{languages}} definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career. He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was <b>emphatic</b> that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, {{and most of the}} early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing {{to the lack of}} funds to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him {{that he would have to}} close the exchange early. Morgan was <b>emphatic</b> that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|During John's reign, Byzantium faced many difficulties: enemies {{confronted the}} empire on all sides. An {{invasion}} of nomadic horsemen {{from the north}} threatened Byzantine control in the Balkans, and the Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. However, John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor. At the Battle of Beroia, John personally led the imperial armies against the Pecheneg invaders. With {{the aid of the}} emperor's elite troops, the Varangian Guard, the tribal horsemen were decisively crushed. The emperor's victory was so <b>emphatic</b> that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people.|$|E
50|$|If Proto-Semitic <b>emphatics</b> were ejectives, {{then the}} Geers' law is {{explained}} as {{a manifestation of}} the widespread constraint in languages having ejectives, which forbids cooccurrence of two ejectives in a root.|$|R
5000|$|Vowel length distinction, the <b>emphatics</b> , , , [...] (sometimes {{realized}} as [...] ) and [...] (often realized as [...] ) are acquired. A geminated consonant {{distinction is}} developing, although children {{have difficulty with}} [...] and its voiced pair [...]|$|R
50|$|In later Punic, the laryngeals and pharyngeals seem to {{have been}} entirely lost. Neither these nor the <b>emphatics</b> could be {{adequately}} represented by the Latin alphabet, but there is also evidence to that effect from Punic script transcriptions.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this <b>emphatic</b> {{assertion}} that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that produced an <b>emphatic</b> art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the beat in the oboes and off the beat in the alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last <b>emphatic</b> sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5000|$|Before <b>emphatics,</b> vowels lower, turning /ə/ into ă, /e, i/ into [...] "emphatic" [...] e, and /u, o/ into [...] "emphatic" [...] o, {{with some}} dialectal {{variation}} (with the realizations of /i, u/ [...] "less open" [...] than /e, o/).|$|R
40|$|The {{role played}} by {{mitigation}} in academic discourse has been widely debated in the literature, but {{little attention has been}} paid to <b>emphatics,</b> expressions used to intensify the degree of certainty of an utterance and to increase its illocutionary force. Focusing on the use of adverbs in journal articles and on their evaluative orientations/parameters, the chapter looks at how their frequencies, meanings and uses vary across two “soft” disciplines: history and economics. Combining a corpus and a discourse perspective, <b>emphatics</b> are shown to signal “engagement” as well as “stance”, by positioning research in the context of disciplinary debate, highlighting the significance of the data or the conclusions produced, negotiating convergent or conflicting positions with the reader...|$|R
5000|$|The {{consonant}} inventory largely resembles Arabic: differentiated voicing; uvulars, pharyngeals (traditionally {{referred to}} as <b>emphatics)</b> requiring the pharynx muscles to contract and influencing the pronunciation of the following vowel (although [...] only occur in Arabic loans and [...] only {{in the name of}} Allah).|$|R
5|$|Ahead of {{the final}} Test of the series, Hassett's Victorians {{suffered}} a four-wicket defeat in their second match of the season against the West Indies, Hassett scoring 56 and 43. Australia completed an <b>emphatic</b> 4–1 result by winning the final encounter, {{even though they were}} bowled out for 116 {{on the first day of}} the match, before fighting back to dismiss the tourists for 78. Hassett's second innings score of 64 took his total to 402 runs (at an average of 57.43), making him the leading run-scorer for the series. Hassett ended the season with a dominant 229 against South Australia, setting up an innings win, dwarfing the 222 and 166 made by his opponents combined. Despite this, New South Wales claimed the Sheffield Shield for the season, and Hassett ended the summer with 855 runs at 61.07.|$|E
5|$|Auburn, like Virginia Tech, {{had gone}} 8–5 during the 2003 college {{football}} season, {{and entered the}} 2004 season with high expectations. The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme—the West Coast offense—and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense. In its {{first game of the}} 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the University of Louisiana-Monroe, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002. One week later, the Tigers backed up their good start with an <b>emphatic</b> 43–14 victory over Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi State University. In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked Louisiana State Tigers. In a hard-fought defensive struggle, Auburn won, 10–9, when a missed extra point was replayed after a penalty.|$|E
5|$|Celtic secured their {{progress}} to the knock-out {{stages of the}} Champions League on 5 December 2012 with a 21 home win over Spartak Moscow, Kris Commons scoring the winning goal in 82 minutes with a penalty. Celtic were drawn against Juventus but succumbed to 50 aggregate defeat in the Spring of 2013 {{to go out of}} the tournament. Despite the <b>emphatic</b> scoreline over the two legs, Celtic were not outclassed by their Italian opponents in terms of general play but while Juventus defended with a ruthless defiance, Celtic in contrast shipped their goals all far too easily. Despite the result against Juventus, Celtic and Neil Lennon won praise for their Champions League campaign.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other Modern South Arabian languages, Mehri 'emphatic' consonants are {{not simply}} ejectives. They may also be pharyngealized, as in Arabic, so it is {{possible}} for Mehri to attest to a transition from proto-Semitic ejective consonants to the pharyngealized <b>emphatics</b> that are found in many Semitic languages.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) {{is the presence}} of [...] "emphatic" [...] consonants.

Using their alphabetic names, these <b>emphatics</b> are: ...|$|R
5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an <b>emphatic</b> yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is <b>emphatic</b> in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|The name {{by which}} the series is known today is not Goya's own. His {{handwritten}} title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other <b>emphatic</b> caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks {{from a number of}} painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.|$|E
60|$|I {{have known}} him indulge in profane, ungentlemanly <b>emphatics,</b> When the Protestant Church has been divided {{on the subject of}} the proper width of a chasuble's hem; I have even known him to sneer at albs--and as for dalmatics, Words can't convey an idea of the {{contempt}} he expressed for THEM.|$|R
50|$|The modal {{system in}} Chimariko is abundant. Modal suffixes attach {{at the very}} end of a verb after all other suffixes are applied and {{generally}} don't occur with aspectual suffixes. The modal suffixes function as interrogatives, negatives, dubitatives, speculatives, conditionals, <b>emphatics,</b> potentials, potential futures, purposive futures, optatives, desideratives, imperatives, admonitives, intensives, inferentials, resultatives, and evidentials.|$|R
5000|$|Lepsius {{typically}} characterized ejective consonants as tenuis, as {{they are}} completely unaspirated, and wrote them with the Greek spiritus lenis (p’, t’, etc.), {{which may be the}} source of the modern convention for ejectives in the IPA. However, when his sources made it clear that there was some activity in the throat, he transcribed them as <b>emphatics.</b>|$|R
