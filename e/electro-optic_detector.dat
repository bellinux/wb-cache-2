50|$|Zinc {{telluride}} {{together with}} lithium niobate {{is often used}} for generation of pulsed terahertz radiation in time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz imaging. When a crystal of such material is subjected to a high-intensity light pulse of subpicosecond duration, it emits a pulse of terahertz frequency through a nonlinear optical process called optical rectification. Conversely, subjecting a zinc telluride crystal to terahertz radiation causes it to show optical birefringence and change the polarization of a transmitting light, making it an <b>electro-optic</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
30|$|ZnTe bulk crystal has {{increasing}} {{importance for}} various advanced semiconductor {{applications such as}} solar cells, blue-green laser diodes, terahertz imaging, <b>electro-optic</b> <b>detector,</b> and holographic interferometry [1 – 7]. The success of doping control of ZnTe thin films also makes ZnTe a suitable candidate for various optoelectronic device materials [8, 9]. ZnTe is well known to exhibit a pronounced preference for p-type due to self-compensation via Zn vacancies [10, 11]. Among many options for p-type doping of ZnTe, nitrogen (N) doping [12 – 16] and copper (Cu) doping [17, 18] have been mostly studied. Even though N doping using a radiofrequency (RF) plasma source has been proved to offer better doping characteristics, Cu doping has also been widely accepted as a good candidate {{as it can be}} achieved using various inexpensive ways including chemical immersions, sputtering, electrochemical deposition, and thermal evaporation [19 – 23]. Among previous reports on Cu doping of ZnTe thin films, most of them mainly focus on their electrical properties {{as a function of the}} Cu concentration without performing their structural and chemical analysis. Akkad and Abdulraheem recently provided evidence for the formation of the ternary zinc-copper-telluride alloy films containing Cu concentration above ~ 4  at.% prepared using RF magnetron sputtering [24], indicating that a structural or phase change could occur as Cu concentration in ZnTe reaches the over-doped regime. In this study, we discovered the formation of one-dimensional (1 D) surface modulation and Cu-Te nano-rods for heavily Cu-doped ZnTe thin films grown by MBE. These findings explain the unusual observations in reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) patterns and apparent resistivity of these thin films upon the increase of Cu cell temperature. Our work demonstrates that a highly reactive dopant could lead to formation of nanostructures in the host matrix, which may generally be applied to the studies of heavy doping using other physical or/and chemical vapor deposition approaches.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the large}} {{conduction}} band offset of nearly 2 eV between GaN and AlN, group III nitride semiconductor heterostructures are of great interest for optoelectronics based on intersubband transitions (ISBTs). These properties allow {{the extension of the}} ISBT wavelength range into the near infrared. In this work near infrared ISBTs in GaN/AlN heterostructures were investigated for samples grown by both plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) and metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). It was shown in the experiment that a 15 Å thick quantum well (QW) absorbs light around 800 meV (1. 5 μm). The highest ISB absorption energy for PAMBE samples in this work is 890 meV (1. 39 μm) and 834 meV (1. 49 μm) for MOVPE. Those results show that both growth techniques are appropriate to achieve short ISBT wavelengths. As group III nitrides are non-centrosymmetric, strong piezo- and pyro-electric fields occur in GaN/AlN heterostructures; they lead to intrinsic asymmetries in the electronic potential of a multi quantum well (MQW) structure and give rise to nonlinear optical phenomena. Based on the photoinduced polarization detection mechanism, ISB detectors were designed and investigated. Photovoltaic responses, which originate both from linear absorption as well as from step two-photon absorption were measured. These prototype photoinduced polarization photodetectors work up to room temperature. The frequency response obtained with a modulated telecommunication laser diode showed a signal up to 3 GHz. A narrow-band electro-optic modulator prototype working around 1. 5 μm based on the depletion of a GaN/AlN MQW region is also presented. Those results on modulation and fast photovoltaic detection at 1. 55 μm illustrate the application potential of group III nitride ISB devices as <b>electro-optic</b> <b>detectors</b> and modulators for long-haul optical fiber telecommunicatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} Information and Communication Technologies is {{witnessing}} a development speed unprecedented in history. Moore’s law {{proves that the}} processor speed and memory size are roughly doubling each 18 months, {{which is expected to}} continue in the next decade. If photonics is going to play a substantial role in the ICT market, it will have to follow the same dynamics. There are mainly two groups of components that need to be integrated. The active components, including light sources, <b>electro-optic</b> modulators, and <b>detectors,</b> are mostly fabricated in III-V semiconductors. The passive components, such as waveguides, resonators, couplers and splitters, need no power supply and can be realized in silicon-related semiconductors. The prospects of silicon photonics are particularly promising, the fabrication is mostly compatible with standard CMOS technology and the on-chip optical interconnects are expected to increase the speed of microprocessors to the next generation. This thesis starts with designs of various silicon-based devices using finite-difference time-domain simulations. Parallel computation is a powerful tool in the modeling of large-scale photonic circuits. High Q cavities and resonant channel drop filters are designed in photonic crystal platform. Different methods to couple light from a single mode fiber to silicon waveguides are studied by coupled-mode theory and verified using parallel simulations. The performance of waveguide grating coupler for vertical radiation is also studied. The fabrication of silicon-based photonic devices involves material deposition, E-beam or optical lithography for pattern defining, and plasma/wet-chemistry etching for pattern transfer. For nanometer-scaled structures, E-beam lithography is the most critical process. Depending on the structures of the devices, both positive resist (ZEP 520 A) and negative resist (maN 2405) are used. The proximity and stitch issues are addressed by careful dose correction and patches exposure. Some examples are given including photonic crystal surface mode filter, micro-ring resonators and gold grating couplers. In particular, high Q (2. 6 × 105), deep notch (40 dB) and resonance-splitting phenomenon are demonstrated for silicon ring resonators. It is challenging to couple light into photonic integrated circuits directly from a single-mode fiber. The butt-coupled light-injecting method usually causes large insertion loss due to small overlap of the mode profiles and large index mismatch. Practically {{it is not easy to}} cleave silicon sample with smooth facet where the waveguide exposes. By adding gold gratings to the waveguides, light can be injected and collected vertically from single-mode fiber. The coupling efficiency is much higher. There is no need to cleave the sample. The access waveguides are much shortened and the stitch problem in E-beam lithography is avoided. In summary, this thesis introduces parallel simulations for the design of modern large-scale photonic devices, addresses various issues with Si-based fabrication, and analyses the data from the characterization. Several novel devices using silicon nanowire waveguides and 2 D photonic crystal structures have been demonstrated for the first time. QC 2010092...|$|R
