40|$|In the United States, {{the ideological}} divide between Left/Right, or ‘progressive/conservative’ has been {{predominantly}} {{defined by the}} abortion issue since its decriminilization in 1973. Feminists who fought that long battle for reproductive rights have been compelled to protect them against political retrenchment. By 2000, human {{embryonic stem cell research}} (hESCR) had eclipsed abortion as the point of resistance for right-to-life activists. While aversion to embryo experimentation is not exclusive to the pro-life camp, pro-choice concerns to not privilege the embryo constrain liberal feminist discourse on the moral/ethical quandaries of such experiments. This thesis unravels political events surrounding hESCR in California between 2004 and 2007, examining the struggles, strategies and outcomes of social actors who crossed the abortion divide to find allies willing to fight <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> <b>cloning</b> and ova harvesting.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to regulate rapidly changing fields of science. New technologies are not anticipated and legislation becomes inadequate. Legislative definitions are also problematic. This article begins with consideration of such difficulties {{in the context of}} research on <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> and <b>cloning.</b> It considers problems with past legislative definitions in Australia, the new regulatory regime, and whether that regime now sets clear boundaries. It is found that problems still exist – some terms are not adequately defined and boundaries for research prove unclear. Three regulatory approaches are therefore discussed. Legislation based on strict definitions is compared to a legislative model that leaves terms undefined. The third model – which combines framework legislation with the oversight of a regulatory authority – is seen as most suitable. However, problems with this model are recognised and suggestions made regarding how to ensure the “framework” remains workable and effective. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2009 Dr. Sonia Marie AllanThis thesis analyses the nature, rationale, and implementation of United Kingdom and Australian regulation of research involving <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> and <b>cloning</b> using legal materials, other documents and qualitative interviews with researchers, practitioners and regulators. It considers how law-makers have decided upon what to regulate and where {{to draw the line}} between permissible and prohibited activities, and the type of regulatory design strategies and enforcement approaches adopted in each jurisdiction (the ‘how to regulate’ question). It is argued that both jurisdictions have effectively decided upon permissible and prohibited activities as a result of thorough public consultation, research, reviews and the parliamentary process, and have appropriately balanced competing rationales for regulation. However, the type of regulation used in relation to those who are licensed to research in this area is unsuitable due to an over-emphasis on deterrence and the authoritarian approach taken by the regulatory bureaucracies. The central thesis is that a responsive regulatory system for licence-holders should be adopted. It is proposed that such a system would maintain the top level ‘command and control’ design strategies and deterrence approaches present in the current regulatory systems for breaches of legislation by non-licence holders and serious breaches by licence holders. However, greater use of co-regulatory design strategies and cooperative, educative and persuasive enforcement approaches should be used for regulating licensed research activities. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|In December 2005, an {{investigation}} by Seoul National University, South Korea, found that scientist Hwang Woo Suk had fabricated results on deriving patientmatched stem cells from <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> — a major setback for the field. In May 2005 Hwang had announced a significant advance in creating <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> using <b>cloning</b> methods and in isolating human stem cells from <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> These developments {{have contributed to the}} debate in the 109 th Congress on the moral and ethical implications of human cloning. Scientists in other labs, including Harvard University and the University of California at San Francisco, intend to produce <b>cloned</b> <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> in order to derive stem cells for medical research on diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and other diseases. President Bush announced in August 2001 {{that for the first time}} federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells, but funding would be limited to “existing stem cell lines. ” Federal funds can not be used for the <b>cloning</b> of <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> for any purpose, including stem cell research. In July 2002 the President’s Council on Bioethics released its report on human cloning which unanimously recommended a ban on reproductive cloning and, by a vote of 10 to 7, a four-year moratorium on cloning for medical research purposes. The ethical issues surrounding reproductive cloning (commodification, safety, identity), and therapeutic cloning (embryos’ moral status, relief of suffering), impact various proposals for regulation, restrictions, bans, and uses of federal funding. In January 2002, the National Academies released Scientific and Medical Aspects of Human Reproductive Cloning. It recommended that the U. S. ban human reproductive cloning aimed at creating a child. It suggested the ban be enforceable and carry substantial penalties. The panel noted that the ban should be reconsidered within five years. However, the panel concluded that cloning to produce stem cells should be permitted because of the potential for developing new therapies and advancing biomedical knowledge. On May 24, 2005, the House passed H. R. 810 (Castle), which would allow federal support of research that uses human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from a <b>human</b> <b>embryo,</b> thus negating the Bush stem cell policy limitation on “existing stem cell lines. ” In July of 2006, the Senate passed H. R. 810 and President Bush vetoed it, the first veto of his presidency. An attempt in the House to override the veto was unsuccessful. Action on the Weldon bill (which passed the House in the 108 th Congress and stalled in the Senate) is also possible; it was reintroduced in the 109 th Congress as H. R. 1357 and S. 658 (Brownback). The bill bans the process of cloning as well as the importation of any product derived from an <b>embryo</b> created via <b>cloning.</b> It bans not only reproductive applications, but also research on therapeutic uses, which has implications for stem cell research. Advocates of the legislative ban say that allowing any form of human cloning research to proceed raises serious ethical issues and will inevitably lead to the birth of a baby that is a human clone. Critics of the ban argue that the measure would curtail medical research and prevent Americans from receiving life-saving treatments created overseas. This report will be updated as needed...|$|R
