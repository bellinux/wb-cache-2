40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the question of}} income adequacy {{as it relates to}} the broader issue of an <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farm</b> size in the Columbia Basin of Washington State. The issue is especially relevant because of possible limitations on farm size resulting from enforcement of the 1902 Reclamation Act. Income estimates derived under two alternative accounting frameworks - the standard economic accounting method and the after-tax cash flow accounting method - were examined. Findings were that the after tax cash flow accounting framework was more appropriate for examining the income adequacy aspect of the viability issue as it incorporated the effect of federal income taxes and farmer's equity, both of which are important determinates of income levels. Using the after-tax cash flow accounting framework, the after-tax cash flow for a representative 320 acre farm was found to range between $ 16, 858 and $ 42, 670 depending upon the profitability of the selected crop rotation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Mid-North of SA was largely native {{grassland}} at the time of white settlement, but it is not so well known that there are large areas of both grassland and grassy woodland remaining on the steeper slopes of the series of ranges that run through the Mid-North. These areas—estimated to be about 500, 000 hectares—are utilised as hills grazing and are not considered to be very productive. My family owns a farm that has a large area of degraded grassy woodland, and our challenge is to run an <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farm</b> utilising this area of degraded native grasses. The predominant grasses are Spear Grasses, Wallaby Grasses and Kangaroo Grass. In common with almost all the other farmers using this type of grazing land, our land has suffered from our lack of knowledge about the plants we are managing. Our past grazing practices—large paddocks set stocked throughout most of the year—have led to a decrease in quality and biodiversity of these pastures, and to a corresponding downward trend in productivity. With new information on native grasses and their management, {{we are in the process}} of changing our grazing regimes to encourage the regeneration of the native grasses, to improve their utilisation, and to increase the biodiversity of our grassy woodlands so that we have a more sustainable grazing system...|$|E

40|$|In today’s Dutch {{agriculture}} {{emphasis is}} put on entrepreneurship, social responsibility and sustainability. But do these fit together? In economic theories entrepreneurs are seen as movers of the markets, seekers of profit opportunities and innovators. Not all farmers however meet these conditions and if they do, {{there is no guarantee}} that this goes with socially responsible entrepreneurship and sustainability. In a sociological explorative study a multiform group of 20 pig and 21 dairy farmers – both male and female – were asked about their views on animal welfare and other features of sustainable farming. The group consisted of conventional, organic and free range farmers with different farming styles. Their farms varied in levels of scale, intensity, degree of specialization and participation in quality assurance schemes. In the indepth interviews, it became clear that the farmers focus on different aspects of sustainability and that multi-dimensional sustainability is not a self-evident aim for all farmers. An <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farm</b> is important for all farmers, although farmers with idealist motives stress this aspect less than other farmers. Social sustainability at the level of the farm (work load and schedule, division of tasks, balance work/ family life/ social life) is accentuated by conventional farmers on large scaled specialized farms. At a higher level of social sustainability (fair trade, fair prices, poverty reduction), in particular organic and biodynamic farmers stress that farmers have to take the responsibility to contribute to social equity. The latter group puts also emphasis on their responsibility towards the ecosystem. They, for instance, focus on sustainable cattle, mineral management and nature and landscape conservation. The interviewed large scale conventional farmers on the other hand, see energy production as a potentially profitable option to contribute to ecological sustainability. This means that agricultural entrepreneurs do not ‘automatically’ take all aspects of sustainability – people, planet and profit – into account. Policy makers who think they can stimulate sustainable agriculture by promoting agricultural entrepreneurship should be aware of this...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable dairy {{production}} requires {{farms that}} are economically viable, environmentally sound and socially acceptable. A low {{environmental impact of}} milk production is not necessarily associated with an <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farm.</b> To gain insight into a possible “trade-off” between economic and environmental sustainability, {{the relation between the}} environmental and economic indicators of dairy farms was quantified, and farm characteristics that influence this relation were identified. Economic and environmental indicators were quantified for 119 specialized dairy farms in 2005, based on data from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Economic indicators used were: gross value added expressed per kg fat-and-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) or expressed per unit of labour, i. e. labour productivity. Environmental indicators used were: land use per kg FPCM, energy use per kg FPCM, global warming potential per kg FPCM, eutrophication and acidification potential per kg FPCM or per ha of land. Environmental indicators were deduced from a life cycle assessment. High labour productivity on dairy farms was associated with low on-farm energy use, total and on-farm land use, total and on-farm global warming potential, and total and off-farm acidification potential per kg FPCM. High labour productivity, however, was associated also with high on-farm eutrophication and acidification potential per hectare. From partial least squares regression analysis, it was concluded that relations between economic and environmental indicators were affected mainly by milk production per ha, annual milk production per cow, farm size, and amount of concentrates per kg FPCM. An increase in annual milk production per cow, for example, not only increased labour productivity, reduced energy use and global warming potential per kg FPCM but also, {{in the case of an}} unchanged stocking density, increased eutrophication and acidification per ha. To be economically and environmentally sustainable, animal production in the Netherlands, therefore, should focus on high animal productivity, i. e. high annual milk production per cow and efficient use of feed per kg milk, and moderate stocking density, provided that a good animal welfare standard is guarantee...|$|E

Chickpea is grown and consumed across five continents, making this crop more important in international markets than other food legumes. Adaptation trials of 15 accessions of chickpea, 13 from the ICARDA collection and 2 from the Portuguese national catalogue, took place during two years in two different countries (Portugal, Syria). The trials were conducted under rainfed conditions using a late sowing date to naturally expose the plants to drought and heat stress. The accumulated results indicate a high variability in the yield response among genotypes and regions. In Portugal differences between the most productive accession and the least productive one was higher than 1000 kg/ha in 2009 (drought year) and than 1500 Kg/ha in 2010 (rainy year). In general, genotypes that fasten their development cycle showed higher grain yield, especially in drought years. Comparing the two years, we observed three groups of genotypes: i) Stable genotypes, well adapted to distinct environments (like ILC 588). ii) Genotypes adapted to adverse conditions, but not responding to favourable conditions (ICL 216); this genotype was also among the best performers under drought conditions in Syria. iii) Genotypes adapted to good conditions, but with bad performance under adverse conditions (ICL 3279). Across the two locations, Portugal and Syria, FLIP 03 - 145 C, FLIP 87 - 8 C and ILC 588 were on the top 5 during 2009.

40|$|In recent years, the {{production}} and marketing of local food has become the fastest growing segment of the natural food industry and {{an important part of}} the sustainable agriculture movement. The heightened attention to local food systems has bolstered farmers markets attendance, Community Supported Agriculture memberships, and Farm to School programs. The movement has gained such popular salience that in 2007, 2 ̆ 2 locavore 2 ̆ 2 (defined as a person who seeks out locally grown foods) was Oxford American Dictionary 2 ̆ 7 s word of the year. Many scholars have also recognized that local food systems may provide positive economic effects (Swenson 2009) and have the potential to build community relationships (Kloppenburg 2000; Lyson 2004). This thesis is based on ethnographic research among local food producers in Iowa that was conducted between June of 2008 and August of 2011. Here I examine the daily practice of producing and marketing local food and consider the challenges producers face in their attempts to develop <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farms.</b> Emphasis is placed on the relationships between small-scale direct market producers and their larger-scaled conventional neighbors, the implications for rural labor associated with alternative agriculture and small-scale processing, and the strategies producers use to meet the demands of diverse market outlets such as farmers markets or institutions. I argue that, while producers differentiate their farms from the conventional, industrial system, they are embedded within it. Local food producers must contend with the same land shortages and federal policies as conventional producers and in some cases they make use of the equipment and expertise of their conventional neighbors...|$|R

The path dependence resulting from the initial assignment of property rights on the Great Plains was slow to be corrected. The transactions costs of property rights reallocation from homesteads to larger farms were high, in part due to government intervention. Local politicians sought to retain the dense, Midwest-like population base that homestead settlement had fostered, and they successfully lobbied the Federal Government for subsidies to maintain small family farms. The result was a halting process of farm size adjustment between 1920 and 1982. This case illustrates the difficult economic problems that can be raised by an inappropriate assignment of property rights. It cannot be assumed that a more efficient allocation of rights with fewer negative effects will occur quickly...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{recognition}} of negative environmental impacts associated with overuse of pesticides {{in the agricultural}} regions of Bangladesh {{has made it clear}} that unsustainable pest-control strategies must change. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was developed for use as a tool in the production of healthy, sustainably grown food. A strategic approach to crop-pest control, IPM aims to minimize pest populations by combining environmentally friendly pest-control methods and <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farming</b> practices. This study examined the impact of IPM on insect damage to crop-yield parameters in a rice agro-ecosystem. IPM methods tested were: 1) collection of egg masses; 2) sweeping (using a funnel shaped net to capture insects); 3) perching (installing a branch or pole which serves as a resting place for predatory birds); and 4) Economic Threshold Level (ETL) based insecticide application (The ETL is the point at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest). We also examined the effects of prophylactic insecticide application and current management practices on rice yield. Rice-yield indicators included number of healthy tillers, number of hills, central leaf drying (Dead Heart), and grain-less panicles (White Head). For two consecutive years, the lowest percentages of Dead Heart (1. 23 and 1. 55) and White Head (2. 06) were found in the IPM-treated plots. Further, the IPM-treated plots had higher yields (7. 3 - 7. 5 ton/ha) compared with the non-IPM treatments (6. 28 - 7. 02 ton/ha). The location of the plots appeared to be non-significant for all measured yield components. The effect of treatment on the percentage of Dead Heart, White Head, number of hills, and yield was statistically significant (p ≤ 0. 05). We concluded that IPM is an effective strategy for obtaining high rice yields in sustainable rice agro-ecosystems...|$|R

Because so little has been written about rural California, I use a wide range of sources to document the existence of family farms and the transference of rural social values from the East and Midwest to the Far West. Using census records, newspapers, diaries, agricultural journals, letters, and booster literature, I show that settlers and civic leaders believed that family farming was the natural foundation for California and that agribusiness was not the inevitable trajectory for the state 2 ̆ 7 s economy;Starting with the gold rush, I examine the shift from mining to agriculture in the state. Miners left the placers to start farms and find wives. Leaders applauded the incipient agricultural communities and encouraged more men and women to settle the state.

Farmers set up homesteads in the mineral districts, in the coastal counties, and the Central Valley, adapting their agricultural skills acquired in the East, Midwest, and South to the unique conditions they found in these regions. Many families balanced market crops with subsistence agriculture as they had in eastern agricultural areas.

40|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} approximately nine {{per cent}} {{to both of}} Thailand’s GDP and exports. Thai farmers are basically smallholders and large numbers of them live in rural areas and below the poverty line. Pervasive and complicating risks cause a farmer’s income to fluctuate every year. The Thai government has tried to strengthen and enhance farmers’ {{ability to cope with}} risk and stabilize their farm income. These issues have been widely discussed in the 10 th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2007 - 2011). The development of appropriate solutions to deal with risks has been impeded {{due to the lack of}} empirical studies on farmers’ responses to risk and the impacts of risk at the farm level in Thailand. This study investigates the farmers’ perceptions of risk and risk management strategies and examines whether the farmers’ characteristics can be influenced by those perceptions. The farmers’ risk aversion is also elicited using the equally likely certainty equivalent approach and four different utility functions are employed to analyse their performances in terms of risk preference classification. Stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) is applied to determine the risk efficient farming systems for the farmers in central and north-east regions of Thailand. The data for this study were obtained from a face-to-face survey of central and north-east region farmers together with the historical data of prices and yields at the provincial level (1998 - 2008) from the Office of Agricultural Economics for each individual crop and livestock in the study areas. The results indicate that marketing risks associated with the unexpected variability of input and product prices are considered as important sources of risk among the farmers in both regions. The production strategy related to the purchase of farm machinery to replace labour is perceived as an important strategy to manage risk by the central region farmers, whereas the north-east region farmers considered storing feed and/or seed reserves as an important strategy. The results also show that some farm and farmers’ characteristics (e. g. gender, education, off-farm work, farm size and farm location) significantly impact the risk perceptions of the farmers in both regions. The negative exponential utility function is performed to describe the farmers’ risk behaviour. This functional form classified all sampled farmers in both regions as risk averse. The SERF results show that maize followed by sorghum (CRFP 4) is the most risk efficient farming system for the extremely risk averse rain-fed farmers in the central region. Intensive planting of wet rice and dry rice cultivation (CIFP 1) is preferred by the extremely risk averse central region irrigated farmers. In addition, wet rice and cassava with raising small herd of cattle (NRFP 5) is the most <b>economically</b> <b>viable</b> <b>farming</b> system for the extremely risk averse rain-fed farmers in the north-east region, while two rice crops with raising cattle (NIFP 3) is preferred by the extremely risk averse north-east irrigated farmers...|$|R

The economic impacts were estimated using simulated net present values, present values of ending net worth, internal rates of return, benefit-cost ratios, annual cash farm incomes, cash expenses, and net farm incomes.

Qualitative interviews and a series of workshops were used to learn about farmers' "desired system state" with regard to their region, disturbances to this system, and their perspectives on organic farming. The desired system in Sölktäler as formulated by the farmers depicts a vivid farming community that manages a diverse traditional agricultural landscape and performs a number of ecological services. The desired system and the principles of organic farming have several aspects in common, and many management practices and features of the social system support social-ecological resilience. The vulnerability of farms increases, however, when farmers must deal with structural changes in agriculture, the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge, and societal transformation. In conclusion, organic farming is a tool that can be used to build social-ecological resilience for Sölktäler farms, because it secures economic funding for the area and makes it possible to sustain environmentally benign practices. What remains is the question of whether the farming community is capable of reorganizing the social system under the pressures of modernization so that the desired system state can be reached...|$|R
