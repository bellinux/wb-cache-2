500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues.

As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E
500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E
500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly opined that the chemistry {{between the two}} actors was [...] "fresh and irresistible." [...] Zorianna Kit of The Huffington Post exclaimed that [...] "what [...] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." [...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
