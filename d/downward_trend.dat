5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E

The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find skilled employment. Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a training allowance to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E

5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and {{the first few years}} of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{budget cuts}} by Gateshead Council {{have seen the}} local {{authority}} transfer {{the management of the}} park to the community, despite a local petition raised in protest. The reserve remains popular with residents; in May 2012 dozens of volunteers cleared rubbish and engaged in a 'Windy Nook Wildlife Festival' with face-painting and other traditional activities. Local police continue to make 'targeted patrols' of the reserve to maintain the <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> of anti-social behaviour in the area. In November 2012 a 'green gym' was opened at the reserve. This saw fitness equipment installed in clusters of three and four machines which is available for use by the public free of charge. This is one of only two such outdoor public gyms in Gateshead, the other being opened simultaneously at Saltwell Park.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> in the melting and boiling points and {{atomization}} enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is nearly}} half as dense as uranium and plutonium, and is harder {{than either of}} them. It becomes superconductive below 1.4K. Thorium's melting point of 1750°C is above both those of {{actinium}} (1227°C) and protactinium (1568°C). In the beginning of period 7, from francium to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), {{because the number of}} delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new <b>downward</b> <b>trend</b> in melting points from thorium to plutonium. The number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals, and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788°C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind osmium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium.|$|E

Also ozone trends should have been approximately 1 %/decade more negative from 1979 - 1989 than from 1989 - 1999 because of the chemical feedbacks. The model results further indicate that both the reported decrease in CH 4 and the increase in H 2 O in HALOE measurements will result in a larger <b>downward</b> ozone <b>trend</b> and a decrease in the hemispheric ozone trend asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|My second chapter, "Does the Cyclicality of Employment Depend on Trends in the Participation Rate?" {{studies the}} fact that the past three recessions were {{characterized}} by sluggish recovery of the employment to population ratio. The reasons behind these ”jobless recoveries” are not well understood. Contrary to other post-WWII recessions, these ”jobless recoveries” occurred during times with <b>downward</b> <b>trending</b> labor force participation rate(LFPR). I extend the directed search setup of Menzio et al. (2012) with a labor force participation decision to study whether trends in LFPR cause jobless recessions. I then show that that recoveries during times of declining LFPR look very different to recoveries during positive LFPR trend. The basic intuition is as follows: During <b>downward</b> <b>trending</b> LFPR, many low productivity workers cling on to their jobs, but once separated, it does not pay off for them to pay the search cost to re-enter the market. If the recession happens during increasing trend LFPR, then the employment recovery is helped by persons entering the labor market. Thus, I highlight that contrary to the usual approach in the literature, it is important to explicitly account for the trend of the LFPR...|$|R
