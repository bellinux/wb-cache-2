5|$|Charles B. Pierce {{was born}} in Hammond, Indiana on June 16, 1938, one of three boys born to Mack McKenny Pierce and Mayven Bryant Pierce. His family moved to the southwestern Arkansas city of Hampton when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few months old. There he was a {{childhood}} friend and neighbor of future film and television director Harry Thomason, and the two made home movies together in their backyards using an old 8 mm camera. His first professional foray into media entertainment was in the mid-1960s as an art director at KTAL-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana. He later became a weatherman and hosted a children's cartoon show for that channel.|$|E

25|$|In September 1950, the anti-communist {{magazine}} Red Channels accused Bromberg {{of being}} a member of the American Communist Party. Subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in June 1951, Bromberg refused to answer any questions in accordance with his Fifth Amendment rights. As a result, he was blacklisted from Hollywood. He suffered enormous stress from the ordeal; friends noted that he aged considerably in a very short time. In 1951 Bromberg sought work in England, but died within the year of a heart attack while working in the London play The Biggest Thief in Town. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few weeks short of his forty-eighth birthday.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan, New Zealand, and Ireland {{played with}} Sri Lanka in Group F of Super 8s. Against Pakistan, Sri Lanka won the match by 19 runs. Dilshan scored 46 runs with some {{innovative}} Dilscoops. Against Ireland, Sri Lanka won by 9 runs, where Irish players came hard at Lankan bowlers. In the last Super 8 match, Sri Lanka beat New Zealand by 48 runs. Dilshan played another magnificent 48 runs and Mendis took 3/9 in the bowling. The semi-final was against West Indies {{for the second}} time in the tournament, where Sri Lanka scored 158/5 in their 20 overs. Dilshan scored another blistering knock with 96 unbeaten runs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> boundary behind to score first T20I century by a Sri Lankan. Dilshan scored 60.76% of Sri Lanka's runs, which was a new Twenty20 International record. However, this only stood for a matter of hours, as Chris Gayle scored 62.38% of West Indies' total. West Indies scored just 101 all out in their 20 overs. Angelo Mathews proved his ability also with the ball, where he took first 3 wickets of West Indian top order. Sri Lanka easily moved to their first T20 International final. However, Mahela ended the tournament as highest run scorer with 302 runs.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) {{as to whether he}} would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E

25|$|The {{assault craft}} {{departed}} from Olterra {{during the early}} hours of 8 December. At 2:15 AM, the first human torpedo reached the area of the boom defences. The motor launches and sentries inside the British base were quietly active and alert, conscious of the danger of a potential attack on the fleet at anchor. One of the security measures taken by the Royal Navy after the summer incursions of combat swimmers was the deployment at Gibraltar of an underwater bomb disposal unit, under the command of Lieutenant Lionel Crabb. A pattern of depth charges was dropped by the motor barges at an interval of three minutes. The craft of Visintini and Magro was apparently hit by one of the charges and destroyed when they were trying to find a breach in the steel net protecting the harbour. Their bodies were recovered by the British some days later and buried at sea with full honors. The second “pig” also endured the strong response of British defences after being uncovered by a searchlight. After a long chase by anti-submarine boats, the Italian crew decided to scuttle their craft and took shelter on board an American freighter. They discarded their swimsuits before submitting themselves to Gibraltar authorities. The last manned torpedo was {{caught in the middle of}} the general alarm across the stronghold, but managed to slip beneath the waters and fool the submarine chasers. The copilot, Leone, became missing during the pursuit and was never found; Cella, meanwhile, abandoned the craft elsewhere, thinking that he was still near Gibraltar or, in the best case, stranded close to the Spanish coast. With the idea of becoming a prisoner of war or being arrested and interned by Spanish authorities in mind, Cella surfaced, only to find that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few meters away from Olterra. His torpedo was recovered by the Italians the following day. The two divers captured by the British told their interrogators that the attack was launched by submarine, successfully deceiving Allied intelligence. Nevertheless, the first human torpedoes mission ended in failure.|$|E

500|$|Whilst still polemical, by 1989's Rotting the band's {{stance on}} Christianity was more {{agnostic}} than Satanic. The original vinyl release {{came with a}} lengthy manifesto written by Lamounier, in which he criticized the alienating effect that Catholicism had on Brazilian society. The band also questioned the divine nature of Christ, declaring <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> regular man who died for his ideas. On a less serious note the album featured [...] "Sex, Drinks and Metal", a hedonistic ode to the headbanger lifestyle.|$|E

Carter, the bassist from that tour, stated that Timmons offered his bandmates a lot of encouragement to experiment and improve from performance to performance, and that he [...] "was a really multi-talented person and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> real sweetheart, a sweetheart of a man."

They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: [...] "itting there, motionless, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mere shadow.

500|$|In August 1979, Shearer {{was hired}} as a writer and cast member on Saturday Night Live, one of the first {{additions}} to the cast, and an unofficial replacement for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who were both leaving the show. Al Franken recommended Shearer to Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. Shearer describes his experience on the show as a [...] "living hell" [...] and [...] "not a real pleasant place to work." [...] He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979-80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> writer. Michaels left Saturday Night Live {{at the end of the}} fifth season, taking the entire cast with him. Shearer told new executive producer Jean Doumanian that he was [...] "not a fan of Lorne's" [...] and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 2009, Warren {{announced}} {{his decision to}} forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. [...] Warren stated that the NFL's Draft Advisory Board advised {{him that if he}} entered the draft, he would be selected in the first three rounds. [...] When Warren signed Drew Rosenhaus as his sports agent, he was projected as a first or second round draft choice. [...] Warren was considered to be a man-to-man defense specialist who needed to develop his zone defense skills. [...] Some sources, such as Todd McShay, who felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> cut below the top five cornerbacks in the draft prior to the 2010 NFL Combine, had predicted that Warren could be selected in the second round. [...] ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. predicted Warren would be drafted in the third or fourth round of the draft, describing him as “a physical corner" [...] who [...] "likes going head to head on an island with the best receivers in the country, he’s never had an issue with that. Anticipation is good. Gambler, though. Gave up some big plays.” [...] Warren aggravated an ankle injury shortly before the NFL Combine, where he struggled in position drills and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds. His disappointing performance was cited as damaging his draft stock.|$|E
500|$|Stephen G. Haw, however, {{challenges}} {{this idea}} that Polo exaggerated his own importance, writing that, [...] "contrary to what has often been said...Marco does not claim any very exalted position for himself in the Yuan empire." [...] He points out that Marco never {{claimed to be a}} minister of high rank, a darughachi, a leader of a tumen (i.e. 10,000 men), not even the leader of 1,000 men, only that he was an emissary for the khan and held a position of some honor. Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a keshig, who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time. Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou, with some stating <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> simple resident, others stating he was a governor, and Ramusio's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else, yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan. Haw also objected to the approach to finding mention of Marco Polo in Chinese texts, contending that contemporaneous Europeans had little regard for using surnames, and a direct Chinese transcription of the name [...] "Marco" [...] ignores the possibility of him taking on a Chinese or even Mongol name that had no bearing or similarity with his Latin name.|$|E

500|$|On May 9, Rentería {{was called}} up to the Marlins {{following}} an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4–2 win over the Colorado Rockies, {{when he entered the}} game in the ninth inning as part of a double switch. He did not have any at bats in that game, though, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Rentería replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3–2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game {{for the first time on}} June 10 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3–2 loss. Rentería did so well as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Rentería strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in [...] Rentería finished the season with a [...]309 batting average, 68 runs scored, and sixteen stolen bases in 106 games. He was second behind Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award balloting.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E
