40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{problems inherent in}} passively ventilating and cooling low and medium rise urban buildings. We focus on overcoming numerous key issues, {{such as those of}} pollutant ingress associated with locating low-level <b>intake</b> <b>openings</b> in passive displacement ventilation systems. A solution is suggested. The concept that is examined is to take ventilation air into the building from the top and to draw it down into the spaces below using the stack effect associated with the difference in temperature between the internal and external environments. Stale air and excess heat from the spaces are discharged via outlet openings into the same external air pressure zone as the inlet. Results of laboratory experiments using the salt-bath technique are reported which substantiate this concept, and two wind-driven devices which may be used to assist the top-down process are described. This paper also discusses methods of occasionally actively cooling the vertical intake ducts of passively ventilated buildings, adopting the top-down system both to boost airflows and to improve internal environmental quality on occasions when solely passively driven ventilation may prove inadequate...|$|R

In 2 -stroke engine, scavenging process {{plays an important role}} regarding engine efficiency and pollutant emissions. Several geometrical and environmental parameters (like piston velocity and inlet/outlet thermofluid conditions) impact the scavenging process and most of them vary when the engine is running. To improve the scavenging process, an analytical model (integrating design parameter variations) is developed and will be implemented in 0 D global model. CFD simulations are used to establish the analytical scavenging model. The CFD model includes species transportation, piston motion (remeshing), turbulent effectsbut it {{does not take into account}} the combustion process or the aerodynamics in the cylinder before the beginning of scavenging. After defining the influent parameters on the scavenging, multiple simulations with varying values of parameters were run and a data base was created. The data base will be used to develop a reduced model of the scavenging process which will be integrated in a global 0 D model of the engine. Through a reference case, the in-cylinder flow is analyzed and the evolution of velocity, pressure, species and turbulent kinetic energy fields during scavenging are discussed. After a statistical treatment, the results of simulations highlight two main significant parameters: the advance of <b>intake</b> <b>opening</b> and the angle of the intake duct.

40|$|The {{considerable}} effort invested by {{automobile manufacturers}} to attenuate various noise sources within the passenger compartment {{has resulted in}} other sources such as induction noise having become more noticeable. This study was undertaken to investigate the feasability of using a non conventional noise cancellation technique to improve the acoustic performance of the induction system by introducing exhaust noise into the intake system through a manifold bridge. The effectiveness of this technique was first investigated using Ricardo Wave, a computational, engine simulation, software program. Using a one-dimensional, finite-difference approach to analyse {{the dynamics of the}} pressure waves, mass flows, and energy losses within the ducts, an optimized bridge configuration was determined. A physical model incorporating the design of the optimized bridge was installed and tested on a motored engine for comparison to the numerical results. The realized attenuation of induction noise due to the manifold bridge was evaluated using 1 / 12 th octave frequency spectra and three-dimensional colour maps of both the unmodified and bridged engine for steady state and transient engine cases. A sound quality analysis was also performed using various psychoacoustic metrics including loudness, sharpness, roughness and fluctuation strength. Both the numerical and experimental models demonstrated reductions in the overall sound level measured at the <b>intake</b> <b>opening</b> with the experimental results being more favourable. While the results of the sound quality analysis correlated well between the numerical and experimental models, the success of the bridging technique was somewhat ambiguous, depending on the sound quality metric used. As with the traditional analysis techniques, the reported loudness was lower for the numerical and experimental bridged engines. Sharpness was found not to be a relevant metric in this study {{due to a lack of}} high frequency content to the noise. Depending on the engine speed, values for roughness and fluctuation strength were either improved or diminished with the implementation of the manifold bridge. For the conditions tested, implementation of the manifold bridge has demonstrated promise. Before it can be declared commercially viable, however, further considerations such as the effects of exhaust gas recirculation and fired engine tests, are warranted.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to explore the physics behind the waterjet/hull interaction, {{and in particular the}} negative thrust deduction often reported in the semi-planing speed range. Another objective is to propose a validated numerical technique for computing the hydrodynamics of waterjet-driven hulls. The parameters that {{play a role in the}} waterjet/hull interaction are split into global effects (i. e. sinkage and trim variations) and local effects (other effects caused by the intake suction) and each are addressed individually in this thesis. Investigation of these parameters is carried out in two different ways. First, assuming the flow to be potential flow, an algorithm is developed for modelling the water/hull interaction. Then, in the second part of the thesis, a technique employing a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver is employed for modelling the flow and understanding the interaction effects. The algorithm used in the first part is called the Pressure Jump Method in this thesis. This method is based on the equilibrium condition that the resistance forces are balanced by the thrust force created by the head increase through the waterjet pump. The Pressure Jump Method is coupled with a potential flow solver capable of non-linear free-surface modelling. Validation and verification of the method are accomplished by comparing the computational results with experimental data available from a test case. The resistance increment of the hull is also estimated using the Pressure Jump Method and the dominant parameters, which contribute to the thrust deduction, are determined. General sinkage and trim changes between the bare hull and the self-propelled hull are also estimated by approximating the waterjet- propelled hull as a flat plate with a rectangular hole representing the <b>intake</b> <b>opening.</b> In the second part of the thesis, a technique using a RANS solver with a Volume of Fluid (VOF) free-surface representation combined with a body force representation of the pump is developed and validated against measurements. Using the results of this technique, the thrust deduction fraction is studied in detail from very low to high speeds. It is revealed that, in the lower speed range, the transom clearance plays an important role in the behaviour of the thrust deduction fraction. Therefore, the transom clearance phenomenon is studied in detail. The reasons for the waterjet-driven hull resistance increment are identified through studying the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance as well as the frictional resistance variations over the entire speed range. The difference between the net thrust and the gross thrust of the waterjet system, which has been a controversial issue, is also studied in this thesis and it is seen that this difference may well be the reason for the negative thrust deduction. Other issues investigated in the thesis are the shape of the capture area and the streamtube within which all water going into the intake is contained, the importance of the velocity profile at the intake and exit, the pressure distribution at the exit and the diameter and position of the vena-contracta...|$|E

The airbrush parameters under investigation were <b>intake</b> valve <b>opening,</b> carrier gas pressure, distance between the airbrush and substrate, concentration of solution, vapor pressure of solvent, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic substrate surface. This study was assessed through the characterization of dried droplet residues of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and of complete films of BSA by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was determined that droplet size was mainly affected by carrier gas pressure and vapor pressure. The parameters <b>intake</b> valve <b>opening,</b> distance between the airbrush and substrate, and concentration of solution control the rate of spray, or solution flux, onto the substrate.

The performance of the DePalma supercharger with atmospheric pressure at the discharge was compared with that of a hypothetical NACA Roots-type supercharger of the same displacement. The tests were conducted at speeds from 1, 000 to 6, 000 r. p. m. and at pressure differences from 0 to 15 inches of mercury. The variation in clearance between the impeller tips and the impeller housing was determined for the DePalma supercharger at a speed of 2, 000 r. p. m. and for the NACA supercharger at speeds from 500 to 3, 000 r. p. m. with the pressure differences for each supercharger varying form 0 to 15 inches of mercury. The results indicate that, if warping and growing of the metals of the case and impellers are neglected, the most uniform clearances can probably be maintained for all operating conditions when the case and impellers are constructed of metals that have the same coefficient of expansion. The results also show that the discharge and <b>intake</b> <b>openings</b> of this model of the DePalma supercharger are too small, which lowers the volumetric efficiency and impairs the performance at all speeds and pressure differences.
