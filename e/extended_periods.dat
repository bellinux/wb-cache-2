5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|The concerto {{also calls}} on the soloist {{to be nothing more}} than an accompanist to the {{orchestra}} for <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> such as the ricochet arpeggios {{at the start of the}} recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.|$|E

50|$|A {{re-entry}} permit {{is required}} by some countries, for their citizens or tourists who leave the country for an <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time. For example, the United States issues a re-entry permit to a resident alien who plans to travel abroad for an <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time (up to two years) while maintaining their permanent residency.|$|R
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} for <b>extended</b> <b>periods.</b> Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of extreme cold {{affected}} the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association {{to care for the}} poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would {{continue}} to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> outside a host.|$|E
40|$|To a one-parameter {{family of}} Calabi-Yau threefolds, we can {{associate}} the <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> map by the log Hodge theory of Kato and Usui. In the present paper, we study {{the image of}} a maximally unipotent monodromy point under the <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> map.

5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E

5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so.

5|$|Susan Stafford was the {{original}} hostess, serving in that role from the premiere until October 1982. Stafford was absent for two <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> once in 1977 after fracturing two vertebrae in her back and once in 1979 after an automobile accident. During these two extended absences, former Miss USA Summer Bartholomew was Stafford's most frequent substitute, with model Cynthia Washington and comedian Arte Johnson also filling in for Stafford.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of subfreezing {{temperatures}} with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
