5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. <b>He</b> <b>further</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. <b>He</b> <b>further</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E

Dominic Wong {{explained}} that since 1988, {{it had been}} the Housing Authority who decided the target amount of public housing flats to be built annually. The government itself had not involved and therefore, figures forecasting the amount of new public housing flats in each year's colonial Policy Address had been provided by the Housing Authority instead. <b>He</b> <b>further</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> the government had only started to make their own forecast since 1997, so it was not the case suggested by Rosanna Wong that the Housing Authority had to fulfill the target amount of public housing flats demanded by the government.|$|E

In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of light. As a result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist.

Stigler also asserts that the model is unnecessary because Chicago theory already included allowances for short-run sticky prices due to collusion, menu costs, and regulatory or bureaucratic inefficiencies in markets.|$|R

Previously, Benny Blanco, Emile Haynie, Diplo, Supa Dups, as well as Mars' production team The Smeezingtons, have been confirmed to have worked on the album.

500|$|The Los Angeles Times film critic, Charles Champlin, {{explained}} that the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival [...] "came into being {{as one of the}} consequences of the political turmoil that aborted the festival in 1968.

[...] <b>He</b> <b>further</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981.

[...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they laughed in all the right places, and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright."

500|$|Speaking {{on behalf}} of its sound, Gary Graff from Billboard {{compared}} the electronic sound in [...] "Ocean" [...] to Goldfrapp's previous albums Black Cherry (2003) and Supernature (2005). Additionally, {{he felt that the}} track is unlike their previous release, Tales of Us (2013), in that it does not contain a [...] "pastoral" [...] sound. Instead, the track contains [...] "heavy electronic beats" [...] and an emphasis on [...] "pulse-pounding synths". Both Goldfrapp and Gregory acknowledged the return to using synths in their music, with the former claiming that it created a [...] "tougher sound" [...] to the track overall. Categorizing the genre of the song as synth-rock, Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine claimed that she could picture Shirley Manson singing the lyrics to [...] "Ocean". Referring to its sound as [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "churning", Spins Anna Gaca noted the [...] "pounding industrial core and [...] faintly sinister processing effect applied to [...] vocals". Labelling the track as a ballad, Sean T.

To the linguists, the term was a windfall, as it enabled them to distinguish a Stammsprach.

500|$|Periyar's {{ideas on}} Tamil {{alphabet}} reforms and his reasons {{were for the}} following such as the vowel 'ஈ' (i), having a cursive and looped representation of the short form, 'இ' (I). In stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Periyar {{thought that it was}} sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. <b>He</b> <b>further</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> the older and the more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' கா ', ' கே ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar argued why should not other compound characters like ' கி ', ' கீ ', 'கு ', ' கூ ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar.

[...] He compared the film's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997, [...] "when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard DiCaprio go under– several times," [...] and thought the same would happen with Frozen. Another reason that contributed to the film's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing [...] "high quality" [...] voice actors for the Japanese-dubbed version, since Japan's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences. Orika Hiromura, Disney Japan's marketing project leader for Frozen, {{said in an interview with}} The Wall Street Journal: [...] "We really put effort into finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well.
