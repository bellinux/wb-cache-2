40|$|<b>False</b> <b>heartwood,</b> as the {{phenomenon}} considerably affecting {{the quality of}} beech logs and trees, has been the object of professional and scientific interest for more than 100 years. Occurrence and characteristics of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> were investigated depending on diameter class of average trees and type of cut in beech stands on a sample of 2308 trees. The age of trees in thinnings ranges between 50 and 91, in preparatory cuts between 96 and 111, in seeding cuts between 101 and 112 and in final cuts between 98 and 112. In thinnings 11. 7 % of trees were found with <b>false</b> <b>heartwood,</b> in preparatory cut 54. 7 %, in seeding cut 71. 3 % and in final cut 84. 6 %. The length of processed logs, and absolute shares of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> in trees, increase from thinning to final cut, while the volume percentage of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> in trees {{for all types of}} cuts, except final cut, decreases. With seeding and final cuts approximately 15 % of volume of processed assortments of the highest quality (A and B quality class) has an excessive share of sound <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> for Aand B quality class. With respect to the volume of large wood, depending on diameter class, the share of quality subclass A–s ranges between 0. 3 and 2 % and the share of quality subclass B-s between 1. 1 and 3. 2 % of large wood volume...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} influence of thermal modification on beech wood, with {{taking into account the}} difference of properties of healthy samples and samples with <b>false</b> <b>heartwood.</b> Thermal modification took place in two stages (165 ° C and 210 ° C), which are together with the untreated set tried on impact strength, bending strength (static modulus of elasticity) and the dynamic modulus of elasticity. The additional measured properties were density, equilibrium moisture and change of color spectrum. The first level of treatment slightly increased the bending strength and the static modulus of elasticity, residue tests, however, showed a negative effect on the other measured properties of the heat treated samples. It has been shown also that <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> has a clearly negative effect on the measured mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Swedish {{owners of}} poplar stands are {{interested}} in both the wood quality {{and the use of}} poplars that are soon to be harvested. An important concern is the frequency of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> (FHW) in the stems. We have presented an overview of the factors causing discolored wood as well as the industrial use and quality of the end products. We have studied poplar stems growing at 22 sites in Sweden between latitudes 55 &# 176; N and 60 &# 176; N. The mean age of the poplar was 23 years (range 14 &# 8211; 41), the mean stand density 1011 stems ha&# 8722; 1 (range 155 &# 8211; 3493) and the diameter at breast height (DBH) (over bark) 246 mm (range 121 &# 8211; 447). All stands were growing on clay soils (light and medium clay and light clay tills). All of the sampled stems (42) contained <b>false</b> <b>heartwood.</b> At 0 %&# 8211; 50 % of stem height, all sampled trees were discolored and at 90 % of stem height, 33 % were discolored. The percentage of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> area by stem area was highest at 1 % and 10 % of stem height (26. 6 % and 24. 7 % respectively). The &# 8220;FHW&# 8221; part of the stem had a radius of 47 mm (range 9 &# 8211; 93) at 30 % of stem height, which corresponds to 50 % of the total stem radius. A log of six meters represents about 30 % of stem height. Equations describing the correlation between DBH and the diameter of FHW at different stem heights (1 %, 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 %) and table describing FHW volume % by total stem volume at the first 50 % of stem height were constructed. These might be helpful for estimating the percentage of fresh wood in a stem. However, most of the fast-growing poplars will be harvested as biofuel...|$|E
40|$|Both {{resistance}} and velocity measurements {{were performed on}} planted and natural limba trees in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While 2 velocity measurements per tree are sufficient for the quick diagnosis of rotten or hollow trees, a compilation of 16 resistance profiles is necessary to distinguish the so-called <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> (limba noir). On those two-dimensional reconstructions, small peaks in resistance correspond roughly with the boundaries of limba noir. Detection methods are influenced by diameter, wood density {{and the presence of}} buttresses. Further research on density profiles is recommended to analyse these influences and the link with both detection methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{management}} of even-aged beech {{stands on the}} quality of beech timberassortments by type of cut were investigated in the region of Bjelovar. The research was carried outusing Croatian timber standards. Assortment tables were developed separately for thinning andintermediate felling, and separately for regeneration and final felling in accordance with theinterventions of management. The average shares of assortments maintained the same ratios by qualityclasses regardless of the applied standards (HRN or HRN EN). The research identified the problems inproduction of assortments, and justified the need for developing separate tables for thinning,intermediate felling, and for regeneration and final felling. Through forest management the quantityand quality of timber assortments may be oriented to a certain extent towards the production target. With the application of tending measures the value of the stand and timber assortments increases overtime. In economic respect, the development of <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> shows an opposite trend. Therefore acompromise must be achieved by proper management and determination of appropriate harvesting ageof beech stands...|$|E
40|$|During {{recent decades}} {{a new type}} of private forest owner has {{appeared}} in Sweden, with forestry goals other than simply generating money from wood production; these goals include hunting, maintaining biodiversity, cultural aspects and historical values. However, multiple goals often conflict with each other, leading to a problem of finding practices that can deliver several goals at the same time. Recently, there has been an increasing move to continuous cover forestry and other systems or practices that are considered more likely than clear cutting to fulfil multiple goals. However, an additional problem is that much of what is said about the suitability of different practices is partly based upon beliefs rather than on sound data, so more research is needed in this domain. Finally, identifying stands that are suited to specific practices represents another challenge. The main objective of the research presented in this thesis was to identify tools that can help foresters to select appropriate practices and suitable forest stands {{that will allow them to}} achieve the multiple goals of small-scale forest owners. Silvicultural practices were identified through a literature search and their appropriateness and value was determined using matrices summarizing the results of published studies. The results indicated that thinning and successive felling were most suitable for delivering the goals considered. Passive practices were less well adapted. Further literature reviews were undertaken to find criteria relevant to six different situations. In order to determine the link between management practices and results, checklists were created for field-testing. Checklists were also intended to be useful in other situations, and two additional lists, ‘Optimizing natural regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) ’, and ‘Avoiding <b>false</b> <b>heartwood</b> in ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) ’, were proposed as further examples of useful checklists...|$|E
