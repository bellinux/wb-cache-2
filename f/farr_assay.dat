IgG from 8 of the 20 SLE patients protected DNA from degradation by DNase {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of DNA bound to IgG as measured in the <b>Farr</b> binding <b>assay.</b> Using IgG from these sera, we showed that the DNA protected from degradation remained bound to IgG during digestion and was 35 - 45 base pairs in size. The size of this fragment is the same as that which has been proposed to be the minimal size necessary for monogamous bivalent binding of IgG to DNA. We therefore compared the ability of F(ab') 2 and Fab' to protect DNA from DNase digestion and demonstrated that the bivalent F(ab') 2 fragments were protective, but that the univalent Fab' fragments were not. These results suggest that some antibodies to DNA that bind to DNA via monogamous bivalent binding can protect a 35 - 45 -base pair DNA fragment from DNase digestion. The implications of this finding are discussed with regard to the in vivo behavior and potential pathogenicity of small DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—This study {{investigated}} the predictive value of rises in IgM class antibodies against double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) for ensuing relapses in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in comparison with rises in IgG class antibodies. In addition, it was analysed whether rises in IgM class anti-dsDNA were associated with specific clinical manifestations of SLE.  METHODS—Thirty four of a cohort of 72  SLE patients who were positive for IgM class anti-dsDNA {{at the start of}} the study or at the time of a relapse were analysed monthly for class specific anti-dsDNA levels during a median observation period of 19. 6  months. Disease activity was scored according to the SLE Disease Activity Index. Anti-dsDNA were measured by IgM and IgG class enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay.</b>  RESULTS—During the study 18  of 34  patients experienced 26  relapses. Twenty two (85 %) of the relapses were accompanied by a positive test for IgM class anti-dsDNA by ELISA, 23  (89 %) were positive for IgG class anti-dsDNA by ELISA, and 25  (96 %) were positive by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay.</b> Patients with rises in IgG class anti-dsDNA by ELISA or in anti-dsDNA by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> had a significantly higher cumulative risk for relapses than patients without those increases (p= 0. 04 and p= 0. 03, respectively). This was not the case for rises in IgM class anti-dsDNA (p= 0. 16). Moreover, a rise in IgM class anti-dsDNA before a relapse was not associated, expressed in terms of odds ratios, with specific clinical manifestations of SLE.  CONCLUSION—Relapses of SLE are frequently accompanied by IgM class anti-dsDNA. Rises of IgM class anti-dsDNA, in contrast with rises in IgG class anti-dsDNA, are not a sensitive tool for predicting a relapse and are not associated with specific clinical manifestations of SLE. ...|$|E

40|$|Antibodies to DNA can {{be found}} in the {{circulation}} of the majority of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). They are quite specific for this disease, which makes their detection an important diagnostic aid to the clinician. Fluctuations in the level of anti-dsDNA in an individual patient generally parallel the clinical state of that patient. Furthermore, the presence of anti-dsDNA may precede the diagnosis of SLE by more than a year. Four methods relevant for the measurement of anti-dsDNA antibodies are discussed in this paper: the ELISA, the indirect immunofluorescence test on Crithidia luciliae, the PEG assay, and the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay.</b> Each of these methods detects a part of the spectrum of anti-dsDNA antibodies present in the circulation of an individual patient. The ELISA is the most sensitive method, whereas the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> is the most specific for SLE.

Mild forms of SLE, where patients only have anti-dsDNA of a low avidity in their circulation, may easily be missed by this technique.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether a new fluid-phase filtration radioassay possesses both high {{sensitivity and specificity}} compared with the currently used ELISA and Farr assays. Methods. Sequential sera (25 samples) from 9 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sera from 20 patients with SLE possessing anti-dsDNA antibodies by the Crithidia assay, 75 patients with rheumatoid arthritis possessing rheumatoid factors, 50 healthy control subjects, 767 from patients with type 1 diabetes, and a commercial standard serum sample were tested for anti-dsDNA antibodies with the 3 different assays. Results. Of serial dilutions of a standard anti-dsDNA antibody sample, only the highest positive sam-ple (50 IU/ml) in the ELISA and the highest 2 positive samples (50 and 25 IU/ml) in the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> were above the normal range.

40|$|When {{measured}} serially by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> at {{a frequency}} of approximately once a month, changes {{in levels of}} anti-dsDNA {{appear to be a}} good predictor of clinical disease activity. Although the role of antibodies to the RNA component of snRNP awaits further studies, measurement of anti-UsnRNP antibody levels seems to be of limited value in monitoring lupus patients in clinical practice. The same holds for antibodies to SSA (Re) and anti-histone antibodies. More recently described antibodies to C 1 q are probably useful in the follow-up of SLE patients suspected of proliferative renal involvement. The best alternative to measuring levels of the antibodies mentioned before is probably serial analysis of activation of the complement cascade. Levels of complement factors like C 3, C 4 and, functionally, CH 50 remain a useful parameter for monitoring disease activity in SLE, although fluctuations in anti-dsDNA as measured by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> seem superior with respect to sensitivity and specificity for an ensuing relapse. Despite the problems in sampling, measuring levels of activated split products of complement factors like C 3 a, C 3 d or C 5 a may prove to be a valuable tool in the follow-up of lupus patients. The involvement of the endothelial surface is illustrated by rising sVCAM- 1 levels prior to relapses in SLE. Although one could expect that subsequent inflammation should be reflected by increased levels of inflammatory molecules like CRP and IL- 6, the use of these molecules as predictors of lupus activity seems limited. Interferon-alpha as a direct reflector of the effector phase seems, however, rather promising in this respect and awaits longitudinal studies to analyse the possible relation with clinical disease activity and other serological parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of anti-dsDNA antibodies {{is important for}} the diagnosis and the follow-up of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For routine detection of anti-dsDNA, the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> and the immunofluorescence technique (IFT) on Crithidia luciliae proved to be very useful. The anti-dsDNA ELISA is not used for routine purposes in our institute since it is flawed by false-positive results due to binding of negatively charged (immune) complexes to the employed precoat (protamine sulphate). Recently, a new anti-dsDNA ELISA has been described in which photobiotinylated dsDNA is coated to streptavidin coated plates. To investigate whether this modified ELISA is more specific than the classical anti-dsDNA ELISA, we tested sera of patients with SLE (n = 51), myasthenia gravis (MG, n = 25), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 25) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS, n = 23) and sera of healthy blood bank donors (BBD, n = 25). In both assays the sera of the SLE patients gave significantly higher values than the sera of healthy blood bank donors. In the classical ELISA, 84 % of the sera from patients with RA and 28 % of sera of patients with MG were found positive. For the modified assay the figures were 8 % and 24 %, respectively. This modified ELISA was further studied and clinically evaluated by comparing it with the classical anti-DNA ELISA and two other anti-DNA assays (<b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> and IFT), using 500 sera sent to our institute for routine anti-DNA determination and sera of an additional 75 healthy blood bank donors. Quantitatively, both ELISAs showed the same high degree of correlation with the IFT. The modified ELISA gave a better correlation with the Fan assay than the classical anti-DNA ELISA.

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that anti-DNA can bind to heparan {{sulphate}} (HS), a constituent of {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM). We hypothesized that binding of anti-DNA to HS in the GBM plays a role in the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis. To test this hypothesis we measured the anti-HS reactivity in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of SLE patients with or without nephritis. In the transverse serum study single serum samples from 26 SLE patients were studied. We found no correlation between anti-HS reactivity and previously development of nephritis (anti-HS positive: seven out of 16 with history of nephritis, two out of 10 without nephritis). However, six of the seven anti-HS positive sera in the nephritis group were obtained within 1 month of the onset of nephritis, suggesting a temporal relationship between anti-HS reactivity and onset of nephritis. In the longitudinal serum study between six and 16 serum samples were studied from each of 10 SLE-patients. In five out of five episodes of nephritis we found anti-HS reactivity before the onset or exacerbation of the nephritis. In four non-renal manifestations anti-HS reactivity was found in only one episode; in none of the three patients who remained clinically stable did serum samples show anti-HS reactivity. Anti-HS reactivity was only found in sera positive for anti-DNA by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> but the anti-HS titre was not a mere reflection of the reactivity measured in the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay.</b> This indicates that only a subpopulation of anti-DNA can bind to HS. We found a high correlation (r = 0. 99) between anti-HS reactivities in plasma and serum and we conclude that anti-HS reactivity in serum samples from SLE patients is not due to in vitro complex formation during clotting.

METHODS: Multiple sera obtained from 156 patients before and after treatment with infliximab and from 37 patients treated with placebo infusions were tested for anti-dsDNA antibodies by 3 methods: Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence test (CLIFT), a commercial <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> (Ortho Diagnostics radioimmunoassay [RIA]) in which the antigen source is mammalian DNA, and a <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> employing 125 I-labeled circular plasmid DNA (Central Laboratory of The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service [CLB] RIA). Patients with positive findings on the CLIFT were also tested for antibodies to histones (H 1 -H 5) and chromatin and for IgM rheumatoid factors (IgM-RFs). RESULTS: None of the RA patients had a serum sample that was positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies by the CLIFT prior to infliximab therapy. Of the 22 patients who developed a positive CLIFT result, 11 (7 % of 156 exposed to infliximab) also had positive findings on the Ortho RIA at a concentration of > 10 units/ml and another 8 (5 %) were positive at a concentration of > 25 units/ml. In all but 1 patient, the anti-dsDNA antibodies were solely of the IgM isotype. Only 1 patient had detectable anti-dsDNA antibodies by the CLB RIA. All sera containing anti-dsDNA by the CLIFT contained antibodies to chromatin, and sera from 2 patients also contained antibodies to histones. IgM-RF titers showed a significant reduction following infliximab therapy in these 22 patients. One patient developed anti-dsDNA antibodies of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotype and had positive results on both Farr assays (peaking at 22 weeks and resolving by 54 weeks); this {{was associated with a}} reversible lupus syndrome. CONCLUSION: Anti-dsDNA antibodies of IgM class are induced by infliximab therapy; the frequency is dependent on the assay method used.

40|$|The {{clearance}} kinetics of homologous soluble pre-formed 125 I-BSA/IgM anti-BSA immune complexes (IgM. IC) {{injected into}} the blood was studied in the rabbit. IgM. IC close to equivalence were cleared with a greater velocity than those in x 5 or x 10 antigen excess. Clearance of BSA specifically bound to antibody, {{was measured by the}} <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> and found to exhibit an exponential mode of elimination suggesting a selective removal of large over small lattice complexes or free antigen. The role of C 3 in the clearance of IgM. IC was examined by treating rabbits with cobra venom factor (CVF). While more variation was noted in CVF-treated rabbits, no statistically significant differences could be detected between C 3 -depleted and control animals. It is, therefore, concluded that soluble preformed IgM. IC are cleared from the rabbit circulation by a C 3 b-independent mechanism. This finding for soluble IC is clearly different from the clearance of IgM-coated red cells from the circulation, which has previously shown to be highly C 3 b-dependent...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{differences}} in both specificity and avidity of anti-DNA antibodies {{were observed in}} the sera of groups of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus glomerulonephritis, active systemic lupus erythematosus without nephritis, and in IgG eluates obtained by DNAase digestion of isolated glomeruli from glomerulonephritic kidneys. With methylated albumin-kieselguhr fractionated 3 H-HeLa DNA {{as a source of}} native or single-strand DNA antigen in a modified <b>Farr</b> <b>assay,</b> an increased level of antibody to native DNA was associated with active systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly active nephritis. The avidity of antinative DNA estimated from plots of the reciprocals of bound and free antigen according to the Sips distribution formula was significanly lower in active glomerulonephritis sera than in sera from patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus without nephritis. However, antinative DNA of uniformly high avidity was found in the glomerular eluates. Avidity of single-strand DNA antibodies did not differ in the various patient groups. The data stronly supprot a major role for high avidity antinative-DNA in DNA/antiDNA immune complex-induced glomerular injury in systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the diagnostic value of low avidity antibodies to double stranded DNA (dsDNA) measured by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) assay was undertaken. By routine screening low avidity anti-dsDNA were detected in the serum samples of 106 hitherto unknown patients. Clinical data of these patients were collected and when only low avidity anti-dsDNA was present (n = 92) a varied disease spectrum was observed. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was established in 48 / 92 (52 %), lupus-like disease in 21 / 92 (23 %), autoimmune hepatitis in 9 / 92 (10 %), rheumatoid arthritis in 8 / 92 (9 %), and {{mixed connective tissue disease}} in 2 / 92 (2 %) of all patients. Patients with definite SLE were all older than 45 years and predominantly female (46 / 48, 96 %). They showed a remarkably low incidence of renal disease (2 / 69, 3 %). When high avidity antibodies to dsDNA as measured by the <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> were present as well (n = 14) a diagnosis of SLE could be established in 12 / 14 (86 %) of all patients, indicating the secondary importance of low avidity anti-dsDNA in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Hybridomas {{producing}} monoclonal {{antibodies to}} DNA were prepared from NZB/W F 1 (n = 20), MRL/lpr (n = 13), mice with a chronical graft versus-host-disease (GVHD) (n = 8) and polyclonally stimulated mice (n = 9). Screening {{was performed by}} means of an anti-DNA ELISA. Reaction patterns in four different anti-DNA assays (anti-DNA ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae, PEG assay and <b>Farr</b> <b>assay)</b> as well as avidity and cross-reactivity of these monoclonals were studied in relation to anti-DNA (sub) class and murine origin of the clones. It was found that monoclonal anti-DNA derived from mice with chronic GVHD did not differ from monoclonal anti-DNA derived from NZB/W F 1 or MRL/lpr mice, with respect to isotype distribution, avidity towards DNA, cross-reactivity and assay behaviour in the anti-DNA assays mentioned before. In contrast, monoclonal anti-DNA obtained from polyclonally stimulated mice were all of the IgM isotype and displayed a stronger cross-reactive behaviour than the other three models. Altogether, these results exclude the possibility that anti-DNA in the GVHD mice originates from the non-specific pool of natural autoantibodies and further emphasize the relevance of chronic GVHD as a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{significance of}} anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) determination was evaluated in a prospective manner from 1974 to 1982 {{in a group}} of 441 patients without systemic lupus erythematosus whose sera were found to contain antibodies to dsDNA on routine screening (<b>Farr</b> <b>assay).</b> Within one year 69 % (304) of these patients fulfilled the preliminary American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Eighty-two of the remaining 137 patients were followed up for several years. At {{the end of the study}} 52 % of these patients had also developed systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients who developed systemic lupus erythematosus were characterised by the occurrence of relatively high avidity anti-dsDNA in the circulation compared with patients who did not develop systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be concluded that about 85 % of patients without systemic lupus erythematosus with anti-dsDNA in the circulation will develop SLE within a few years. Taking into account the relative avidity of anti-dsDNA, as determined by calculation of Farr/polyethylene glycol (PEG) ratios, we conclude that patients with relatively high avidity anti-dsDNA are more prone to develop systemic lupus erythematosus than patients with relatively low avidity anti-dsDNA...|$|E
40|$|A {{conjugate}} of a hapten (NIP) and {{a strongly}} antigenic protein chicken gamma globulin (CGG), when injected in soluble form into mice, induced weak primary responses, as weak as responses induced by conjugates of NIP (or other haptens) to polysaccharides Ficoll or alpha (- 1 - 6) dextran. Mean concentrations of anti-hapten antibodies on day 14 varied {{within the range}} of 37 - 105 micrograms/ml (C 57 BL mice) or 14 - 38 micrograms/ml (CBA mice). The NIP-protein conjugate administered in alum-precipitated form induced 100 times higher primary antibody responses. Alum-precipitation of NIP-Ficoll made it a modestly stronger antigen than soluble NIP-Ficoll. When lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected together with any of the soluble antigens, the mice produced plenty of anti-hapten antibodies regardless of whether the antigen was hapten-polysaccharide or hapten-protein conjugate. Concentrations on day 14 varied from around 400 micrograms/ml to approximately 1600 micrograms/ml. LPS had a similar adjuvant effect on antidextran responses. LPS alone induced a polyclonal immunoglobulin production, and the immunoglobulin produced included 'anti-NIP' or 'anti-dextran' detectable in the solid phase antibody assay. These 'antibodies' induced by LPS alone were almost totally mercapto-ethanol-sensitive and poorly detectable by <b>Farr</b> <b>assay</b> or the bacteriophage assay. The response to the LPS+antigen combination was specific for the antigen and included both mercapto-ethanol-sensitive and resistant antibodies...|$|E
