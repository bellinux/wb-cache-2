5|$|In a 2005 Canadian dispute, Rogers Media and Newcap Broadcasting {{maintained}} a joint sales agreement pertaining to CHNO-FM in Sudbury, Ontario, but community <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lobby group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting presented substantial {{evidence to the}} Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that in practice, the agreement was a de facto LMA, going significantly beyond advertising sales into program production and news-gathering. LMAs in Canada cannot be implemented without the CRTC's approval, and in early 2005, the CRTC ordered the agreement to cease.|$|E

5|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service, the {{smallest}} of the Western border surveillance organisations. Its personnel served as a liaison between British military and political <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> German agencies on the border. The BFS was disbanded in 1991 following Germany's reunification.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning {{whether or not}} a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> airlines supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} country, and {{particularly}} Texas, Galveston boomed in the 1920s. But even the Great Depression did not stop Galveston's run of prosperity. Despite the financial ruin that faced {{much of the country}} during the Depression, not a single Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of. Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution, in addition to many legitimate businesses. During much of the period, the vice industries provided the majority of employment. Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era: the Moodys controlled the largest legitimate <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises. Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E
5|$|Shultz and Godson discuss Soviet {{disinformation}} tactics including {{injection of}} Communist propaganda through covert {{groups within the}} U.S.S.R. tasked with disrupting activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S. The book explains disinformation methods including forgery as covert operation, agents of influence, and using social influence to turn targets into useful idiots. They focus on disinformation activities of Soviet intelligence from 1960 to 1980. Shultz and Godson discuss case studies as examples of Soviet disinformation, including a French journalist covertly financed by Russian agents in order to publish biased material against Western <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> front organization activities of the World Peace Council. They back up their analyses with two Soviet intelligence defectors.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E

25|$|The commons {{dilemma is}} a {{specific}} class of social dilemma in which people's short-term selfish interests {{are at odds with}} long-term group <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> common good. In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including resource dilemma, take-some dilemma, and common pool resource.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Exchange was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1838. The building was rebuilt by 1844, but many of Lloyd's early records were lost. In 1871, the Lloyd's Act was passed in Parliament which gave the business a sound legal footing. The Lloyd's Act 1911 set out the Society's objectives, which include the promotion of its members' <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> collection and dissemination of information.|$|E

Things came to a head in 1896, when first Edward Dean Adams was appointed president, then less than two months later, Edwin Winter.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, {{the number}} of hedge funds {{increased}} significantly, with the 1990s stock market rise, the aligned-interest compensation structure (i.e. common financial <b>interests)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> promise of above high returns as likely causes. Over the next decade, hedge fund strategies expanded to include: credit arbitrage, distressed debt, fixed income, quantitative, and multi-strategy. US institutional investors such as pension and endowment funds began allocating greater portions of their portfolios to hedge funds.|$|E

25|$|In March 1965, Johnson sent to Congress a {{transportation}} message {{which included the}} creation of a new Transportation Department—which would include the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the house, passage required negotiation over maritime <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bill was signed October 15, 1965.|$|E
25|$|Political debate resurfaced the {{following}} year, after patronage continued to accelerate. The Civil Aviation Administration launched {{a proposal to}} build an airport at Hurum in 1986. The motion {{was supported by the}} center-right parties, commercial <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> airlines, largely based on that Hurum was closer to more people. However, Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Borgen of the Labor Party supported Gardermoen, large for reasons related to rural policies. Hence a series of government documents were created to investigate the various locations.|$|E
