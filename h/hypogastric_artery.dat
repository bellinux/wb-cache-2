50|$|The {{internal}} iliac artery (formerly {{known as}} the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery)</b> is the main artery of the pelvis.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the {{superior}} vesical artery represents the terminal section of the previous portion of the umbilical artery (fetal <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery).</b>|$|E
50|$|It runs {{backward}} and upward on the lateral {{wall of the}} pelvis below the obturator artery, and then passes between the ureter and the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery,</b> to end in the hypogastric vein.|$|E

40|$|Transcatheter {{embolization}} of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> {{has become}} more and more widely used in the management of bladder hemorrages due to inoperable pelvic cancers. It is a not shocking technique for the patient, without major complications. However, if its immediate results can be defined as very good, its long-term effects are not well known. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the Authors' experience on this matter, which is based on 9 cases of transcatheter embolization of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries.</b> The patients were followed for at least 1 year or, in some cases, until their death...|$|R
30|$|Trans-catheter {{uterine artery}} {{embolization}} was originally used in obstetrics in 1979 to control persistent massive postpartum haemorrhage after failure of surgical ligation of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries.</b> The same procedure {{was introduced by}} Ravina et al., in 1994, as a primary treatment for uterine fibroids [5].|$|R
50|$|At birth, {{when the}} placental {{circulation}} ceases, the pelvic portion {{only of the}} umbilical artery remains patent {{gives rise to the}} superior vesical artery (or arteries) of the adult; the remainder of the vessel is converted into a solid fibrous cord, the medial umbilical ligament (otherwise known as the obliterated <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery)</b> which extends from the pelvis to the umbilicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{abdominal}} aneurysm extends down to {{the common}} iliac arteries in about 25%-30% of patients. In such cases, the iliac limbs can be extended into the external iliac artery to bypass a common iliac aneurysm. Alternatively, a specially designed endograft, (an iliac branch device) {{can be used to}} preserve flow to the internal iliac arteries. The preservation of the hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries is important to prevent buttock claudication and impotence, and every effort should be made to preserve flow to at least one <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
40|$|PurposeHypogastric artery {{interruption}} {{is sometimes}} required during aortoiliac aneurysm repair. We have not experienced {{some of the}} life-threatening complications of pelvic ischemia reported by others. Therefore we analyzed our experience to identify factors that help minimize pelvic ischemia with unilateral and bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruption. MethodsFrom 1995 to 2003, 48 patients with aortoiliac aneurysm required interruption of both hypogastric arteries as part of endovascular (n = 32) or open surgical (n = 16) repair. During endovascular aneurysm repair coils were placed at {{the origin of the}} hypogastric arteries, and bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruptions were staged at 1 to 2 weeks when possible. Open surgery necessitated oversewing or excluding the origins of the hypogastric arteries and extending the prosthetic graft to the external iliac or femoral artery. Collateral branches from the external iliac and femoral arteries were preserved, and patients received systemic heparinization (50 units/kg). ResultsThere was no buttock necrosis, ischemic colitis requiring colon resection, or death with the bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruption. Initially buttock claudication developed in 20 patients (42 %), but persisted in only 7 patients (15 %) at 1 year. New onset of impotence occurred in 4 of 28 patients (14 %), and there were no neurologic deficits. ConclusionsBilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruptions can be accomplished with limited morbidity. When <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruption is needed during endovascular aneurysm repair, certain principles help minimize pelvic ischemia. These include <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruption at its origin to preserve the pelvic collateral vessels, staging bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> interruptions when possible, preserving collateral branches from the femoral and external iliac arteries, and providing adequate heparinization of the patient during these procedures...|$|E
30|$|In a young patient {{affected}} by choriocarcinoma and metrorrhagia, a computed tomography showed a giant arterio-venous fistula, pulmonary metastases and embolism. A transfemoral diagnostic arteriography showed a giant arterio-venous fistula sustained by {{right and left}} <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> with early opacification of the right gonadal vein and of the inferior vena cava. A transarterial embolization of the distal branches of <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> with poly-vinyl-alcohol particles, coils and Squid was performed. A transfemoral phlebography of the right gonadal vein showed multiple thrombi, responsible of the pulmonary embolism. An Amplatzer plug via trans-jugular was finally placed at {{the confluence of the}} gonadal vein in the vena cava, to reduce arterio-venous fistula out-flow and to occlude the vein, preventing further episodes of pulmonary embolism. Metrorrhagia progressively disappeared. A second transarterial embolization combined with a complete response to systemic chemotherapy determined arterio-venous fistula resolution.|$|R
40|$|AbstractColonic {{ischemia}} is {{a recognized}} complication of either open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The clinical difficulty {{in establishing the}} diagnosis, the severity of this complication and the patient's poor physiological status {{may lead to a}} fatal outcome. We presented a case of ischemic colitis in a patient with patent <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> that occurred after an endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair as well as a review of the available literature. The patient's preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were recorded. A thorough search through the Google data and Medline to review similar cases or any analyses that referred to ischemic colitis after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair was conducted. A 76 -year-old male was admitted to our department for an elective endovascular repair of an 8  cm in diameter abdominal aortic aneurysm. A Zenith bifurcation graft was implanted. The whole procedure was uneventful and the final angiogram showed an accurate deployment of the endograft without endoleaks and patency of both <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries.</b> During the 1 st postoperative day, the patient developed symptoms of acute abdomen in combination with metabolic acidosis and oliguria. He underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed necrosis of the sigmoid. A Hartmann's procedure was performed; the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where he deceased after 24  h. Postoperative ischemic colitis has been described after open abdominal aneurysm repair. The description of this complication has been reported since the early phase of endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair development with a current incidence of 1. 5 %– 3. 0 %. Possible mechanisms that may contribute to ischemic colitis in spite of the presence of patent <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> include atheroembolization, shock, vasopressive drugs and inferior mesenteric artery occlusion...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{our initial}} experience with <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion using a nitinol vascular plug during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsWe reviewed the records {{and images of}} 23 consecutive patients who underwent transluminal vessel occlusion of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> with a nitinol plug, {{as well as a}} cohort of 19 patients who underwent <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> embolization with coils in conjunction with EVAR. ResultsThere were no demographic {{differences between the two groups}} of patients. <b>Hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion was successful in all cases when a nitinol vascular plug was used. When coils were used, there was one unsuccessful embolization which required a second procedure. The number of embolic devices used in the coil group was 7. 53 (range, three to 13) compared with 1. 35 (range, one to six) in the plug group (P <. 05). Only one plug was used in 19 of 23 cases. The average cost to embolize per <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> was $ 1, 496 compared with $ 470 when a nitinol plug was used. There were two instances of coil migration. No other intraoperative complications occurred. At one month follow up, seven patients (35 %) in the coil group complained of buttock claudication compared with two patients (9 %) in the nitinol plug group (P =. 027). ConclusionOur experience demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the nitinol vascular plug for <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion during EVAR. When compared with coils for hypogastric embolization during EVAR, nitinol vascular plugs are less expensive, produce less technical complications, and are associated with a significantly lower incidence of gluteal claudication...|$|E

40|$|Objective/BackgroundTo {{report on}} our {{experience}} of the treatment of aortic aneurysms by custom-made, branched stent-grafts with an additional inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) side branch to preserve IMA perfusion in patients at risk for colon ischemia. MethodsThree male patients (mean age 60 years) with a thoracoabdominal, pararenal, and infrarenal aortic aneurysm (AA), respectively, were treated by endovascular aneurysm exclusion using custom-made, branched stent-grafts with a side branch to the IMA for prevention of colon ischemia. Indications for selective IMA side branch perfusion were occlusions or high-grade stenosis of the visceral or <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries.</b> ResultsNo colon ischemia and no neurological deficit were observed. All three IMA side branches were perfused and patent, as documented by computed tomography scan and duplex ultrasound postoperatively and after 12 months. Patency after 24 months was documented as 2 / 3.

40|$|Abnormal {{attachment}} of {{the placenta}} (Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta) is an uncommon but potentially lethal cause of maternal mortality from massive postpartum hemorrhage. A 33 -yr-old woman, {{who had been}} diagnosed with a placenta previa, was referred at 30 weeks gestation. On ultrasound, a complete type of placenta previa and multiple intraplacental lacunae, suggestive of placenta accreta, were noted. For further evaluation of the placenta, pelvis MRI was performed and revealed findings suspicious of a placenta increta. An elective cesarean delivery and subsequent hysterectomy were planned for the patient at 38 weeks gestation.

However, acute interruption of hypogastric perfusion can result in symptoms of pelvic ischemia. We describe a technique in which a prosthetic graft is used as an external iliac artery conduit to facilitate {{the passage of the}} endograft delivery catheter/sheath and after completion of the endovascular portion of the procedure, a surgical bypass is completed with anastomosis of the graft to the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery.</b> (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 1289 - 91. ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveAvoidance of nephrotoxic {{contrast}} agents during endovascular {{repair of}} abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) {{may reduce the}} incidence of renal dysfunction following the procedure. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) angiography is a safe alternative to iodinated contrast media vastly under-utilized by vascular surgeons. We herein describe our experience with a simple angiographic technique using CO 2 for EVAR guidance that does not require a separate angiographic catheter. MethodsEighteen patients underwent EVAR using angiography with CO 2 delivered through the endograft sheath. The renal and <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> were localized for endograft deployment exclusively with CO 2 in all patients. Completion angiography was done with CO 2 in all patients and an additional angiogram with iodinated media was done in 13 cases. ResultsAll endograft deployments were done successfully with CO 2 angiography injected through the endograft delivery systems and femoral access sheaths. Additional iodinated media completion angiography did not modify the procedure in any case. All patients were discharged within two days after surgery. There were no ischemic or systemic complications related to CO 2 administration. Follow-up CT-scan revealed well positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> in all patients, and no additional endoleaks. No significant deterioration in renal function occurred in any case. ConclusionCarbon dioxide angiography conducted through the endograft delivery sheath is reliable for endograft deployment, safe, non-toxic and inexpensive. In addition, it may expedite EVAR by eliminating a number of angiographic catheter placements and exchanges during the procedure. This favorable experience warrants further utilization of this technique...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundSpinal cord {{ischemia}} {{is a rare}} complication after open surgical repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). The use {{of emergency}} endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (eEVAR) is increasing, and paraplegia has been observed in a few patients. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the incidence and pathogenesis of spinal cord ischemia after eEVAR in greater detail. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of patients who had eEVAR for rAAA in three hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium during a 3 -year study period that ended in February 2004. The use of aortouniiliac devices combined with a femorofemoral crossover bypass was the preferred technique. Patients with postoperative symptoms of spinal cord ischemia were identified and the influence of potential risk factors was assessed. These factors included the presence of common iliac artery aneurysms necessitating device limb extension to the external iliac artery with associated overlapping the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery,</b> the prolonged interruption of bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> arterial inflow during the procedure (defined “functional aortic occlusion time” > 30 minutes), and the occurrence of preoperative hemodynamic shock. ResultsThirty-five patients were treated by EVAR and they constituted the study group. The first-month mortality in the study group with EVAR was 23 %. Four patients (11. 5 %) with EVAR developed paraplegia postoperatively; the unilateral or bilateral <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> in all four patients became occluded during the procedure. In the other 31 patients who did not have paraplegia, the unilateral or bilateral hypogastric arteries became occluded in 14 patients (45 %). This constituted a significant difference in the prevalence of <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> occlusion in patients with or without paraplegia (P =. 04). The functional aortic occlusion time was prolonged in all four patients with paraplegia and in five without spinal cord ischemia (P =. 0003). All four patients with spinal cord ischemia presented with hemodynamic shock. This factor did not reach a significant difference from nonparaplegic patients. ConclusionEmergency EVAR continues to be a promising approach to reduce the high mortality of rAAA, but the incidence of spinal cord ischemia after endovascular treatment of rAAA was worrisome. Although the pathogenesis is most likely multifactorial, interruption of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> inflow appeared to have significant influence. In patients with aneurysmatic common iliac arteries, any effort should be made to minimize hypogastric occlusion time during the procedure and to maintain <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> inflow afterwards, either by the use of a bell-bottom iliac extension or by electing open repair...|$|E
30|$|Undiagnosed {{placenta}} percreta or unsuccessful surgery, {{as in our}} cases, and uterine rupture {{or failed}} methotrexate treatment could mandate surgery [6, 7].

In obese women, the incision should be made well lateral {{to the edge of the}} rectus sheath, taking care to avoid injury to vessels on the pelvic side wall when the sharp trocar is introduced.

40|$|BackgroundMultiple {{strategies}} {{have been devised}} to extend the applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in patients with common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms. This {{study was designed to}} examine outcome in patients undergoing EVAR with either <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> embolization or common iliac artery bifurcation advancement by hypogastric bypass. MethodsA retrospective review of all patients undergoing EVAR since the inception of our program (1997 - 2006) was performed. Data were prospectively collected in an EVAR registry. Patients with large common iliac artery aneurysms (≥ 20 mm) and patent hypogastric arteries not amenable to a cuff or “bell bottom” technique were treated with coil embolization (EMBO) and/or hypogastric revascularization (BYPASS). The perioperative and mid-term outcomes were compared with the larger group of patients undergoing EVAR that did not require either treatment (CTRL). Bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms were treated with unilateral coil embolization and contralateral bypass. ResultsCommon iliac artery aneurysms were present in 137 (31 %) of the 444 patients undergoing EVAR, but only 57 (42 %) of 137 required direct management. This included <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> embolization alone (EMBO) in 31 or <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> revascularization (BYPASS) in 26, with and without contralateral embolization (both revascularization/embolization in 46 %). The procedure length (CTRL, 159 ± 72 minutes; EMBO, 153 ± 39 minutes; BYPASS, 283 ± 75 minutes) and estimated blood loss (CTRL, 251 ± 313 mL; EMBO, 233 ± 158 mL; BYPASS, 400 ± 287 mL) were significantly greater (P <. 05) in the BYPASS group. The incidence of any postoperative complication (CTRL, 26 %; EMBO, 68 %; BYPASS, 54 %), any ischemic complication (CTRL, 6 %; EMBO, 55 %; BYPASS, 27 %), and new-onset buttock claudication (CTRL, 3 %; EMBO, 39 %; BYPASS, 27 %) were all significantly greater in the BYPASS and EMBO group relative to the control (CTRL) group (n = 387). The incidence of new-onset buttock claudication ipsilateral to the hypogastric bypass was 4 %; the balance of the new onset claudication in the BYPASS group was due to the contralateral embolization. The primary <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> bypass patency was 91 ± 11 % (SE) at 36 months by life-table analysis. ConclusionsDespite its increased complexity, <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery</b> bypass is an excellent alternative to embolization in terms of patency and freedom from ischemic symptoms for patients with large common iliac artery aneurysms undergoing EVAR...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the ischemic {{complications}} in the colorectal and gluteal region in patients operated on by the authors for infrarenal aortic aneurysms between 1983 and 1986 showed that in 13 cases the morbidity and in 2 cases the mortality were due to reduction of perfusion in the vascular bed of the <b>hypogastric</b> <b>artery.</b> This fact has made the authors carefully consider the indication for simultane-ous revascularization of the internal iliac artery in reconstructions of the aor-toiliac segment for aneurysms in the years from 1987 to 1989.

30|$|Approximately 1 – 2 % of all {{singleton}} deliveries {{are complicated}} by retained placental tissue (RPT) [1 – 3]. Half of all secondary postpartum haemorrhages {{are caused by}} retained placental tissue (RPT) [3]. Various drug therapies and surgical therapies to control the bleeding, {{to clean out the}} uterus, and to prevent or treat infection are used as treatment. Oxytocics, ergometrine, methotrexate and prostaglandins are used as drug treatment. Surgical interventions to evacuate the uterine cavity include curettage, hysteroscopic loop resection or morcellation [4]. Uterine or hypogastric ligation or embolisation or hysterectomy is used to control the bleeding. Bilateral ligation of the uterine or <b>hypogastric</b> <b>arteries</b> is a useful procedure but complications may occur including the need for significant blood transfusion, persistent retained placental tissue and risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies [5].
