50|$|When F. novicida and F. tularensis are grown, {{they appear}} to be morphologically very similar. They are both Gram-negative bacilli. Many tests have been done to try to {{distinguish}} if F. novicida and F. tularensis should be considered separate species. One of these tests involved growth on cysteine-glucose-blood agar (CGBA). F. tularensis took 2 to 7 days to appear on the CGBA, while F. novicida took only 24 hours to appear. F. novicida grows much more rapidly on CGBA than F. tularensis. Another difference between the two is the virulence of F. novicida was lower. F. tularensis was highly virulent in the mice and cavies (guinea pigs) used in studies. It only took one to 10 cells of F. tularensis to kill the animal of either species, although F. novicida took 10 to 100 cells in cavies and up to a 1,000 cells in mice. The immunological differences, though, are the strongest evidence used to support the idea that F. novicida and F. tularensis are separate species. Nonliving vaccines provided no protection against the heterologous organism. However, these nonliving vaccines did provide protection against the homologous organism. The living vaccines provided protection and cross-protection. as well. No protection was demonstrated against F. tularensis when using an F. novicida vaccine in any experiment. Therefore, a fundamental difference appears to exist in the antigenic composition of the two organisms, which was also demonstrated by cross-absorption in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test (PCAs). The ability of the given antigen to remove all reactivity from its <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> while leaving the heterologous antiserum intact indicates the lack of antigen identity. To many scientists, this is enough proof to consider F. novicida and F. tularensis as separate species. Much debate still occurs over how to classify the two organisms, and it is important for scientists to establish a species concept for this organism due to its medical relevance.|$|E

This material, containing 12 to 20 % protein, 11 to 19 % carbohydrate, and about 16 % unbound lipid, had a mean lethal dose for mice of about 500 mug.

A suspension of G vaginalis incubated at 37 degrees C for one hour in heat inactivated <b>homologous</b> mouse <b>antiserum</b> with unheated normal human serum as a source of complement did not show any less viability than the control mixture using heat inactivated human serum.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} to {{elucidate}} the in vivo antigenicity of homologous animal organs, {{especially of the}} liver, and also to clarify the problem centering around the visceralspecificity and the harful effect of the <b>homologous</b> liver <b>antiserum</b> obtained from the same species of animals sensitized with the homologous animal antigens, the author carried out serological investigations, and obtained the following results. 1. Antigenicity can be recongized in the liver {{of the same species}} of animals, but its antibody titer is lower than that of different species of animals; and moreover, the in vivo reactions between such a liver antiserum and various visceral antigens of rabbits reveal a relative visceral specificity. 2. When the same species of animal is sensitized with antigen extracted from the rabbit liver, homologous liver antibody can be detected not only in the circulating blood but also in various organ tissues of the rabbit. 3. When the <b>homologous</b> liver <b>antiserum</b> obtained from the same species of animal sensitized with the antigen extracted from rabbit liver is inoculated into the same species of rabbits, disturbances in the liver and neighboring internal organs can be recognized serologically and functionally. Moreover, the serum of such animals possesses the relative visceral specificity...|$|R
40|$|A {{filamentous}} alpha-hemolytic streptococcus of provisional capsular type 87 {{isolated from}} the human respiratory tract {{has been shown to}} be binary capsulated. One of the capsular antigens appears to be a glycoprotein; the other appears to be a polysaccharide. Transformation reactions with deoxyribonucleic acid from streptococcus type 87 and a number of noncapsulated pneumococci yielded transformed pneumococci with either a glycoprotein capsule or a polysaccharide capsule, but not with both. Capsular precipitin (quellung) reactions were observed when streptococcus type 87 was treated with <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> or with antisera to either of the two distinct capsular transformants. Each of the transformed pneumococci gave a quellung reaction with its <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> or with antiserum to streptococcus type 87, but neither reacted with antiserum to the heterologous transformant. Chemical analysis showed the glycoprotein antigen of streptococcus type 87 to contain, in addition to amino acids, glucose, galactose, glucosamine, and phosphate. The amino acid composition of the glycoprotein capsular antigens from streptococcus type 87 and of those from transformed pneumococci were similar, showing only minor differences. The glycoprotein capsular antigen from streptococcus type 87 gave two closely associated precipitin bands with <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> or antisera to transformed pneumococci with the glycoprotein capsule. That the two precipitin bands represent two unrelated proteins is precluded largely on the basis of the unlikely probability of 100 % cotransformation of the genes coding for both proteins in the pneumococcal transformants that were isolated. Chemical analyses of the various fractions of the glycoprotein indicate that the two precipitin bands may represent a glycoprotein and its corresponding apoprotein...|$|E

J 5 antiserum reacted to the greatest extent with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from A 2385 grown for up to 10 h, and reactivity greatly diminished thereafter; <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> showed no difference in reaction over time. LPS from smooth bacteria grown for 19 h showed no reaction with J 5 antiserum in immunoblots, while LPS from A 2385 grown for 5 or 10 h showed a positive reaction.

40|$|Hyperimmune {{antisera}} to purified Sindbis (SIN) or Semliki Forest (SF) virus {{were used}} to identify alphavirus-specific and cross-reactive proteins in virions and infected cells. The hyperimmune sera participated in homologous and cross-cytolysis of alphavirus-infected cells, {{and the use of}} monospecific antisera to SIN structural proteins suggested that E 1 and E 2 could serve as target proteins in cytolysis. Proteins from purified virions or infected cells were extracted with Nonidet P- 40, denatured by procedures for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose solid supports, and reacted with hyperimmune sera and 125 I-labeled protein A (immunoblotting on denatured proteins). Alternatively, native proteins extracted by mild Nonidet P- 40 treatment were precipitated with hyperimmune sera before denaturation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After immunoblotting, <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> reacted with the virus structural proteins E 1, E 2, capsid extracted from purified virions, and the counterparts of these proteins extracted from infected cells. In addition, PE 2 and a 92, 000 -molecular-weight protein from infected cells reacted with <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum.</b> These proteins were also immunoprecipitated with <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum.</b> After immunoblotting, the Sindbis capsid protein was shown to be cross-reactive whether derived from purified virions or from infected cells; no cross-reactivity was observed with PE 2 or E 2 from either source, and the E 1 glycoprotein was shown to be cross-reactive only when obtained from virions. However, the E 1 glycoprotein could be cross-immunoprecipitated from infected cells (as well as from disrupted virions), and, in addition, capsid and a 92, 000 -molecular-weight protein were cross-immunoprecipitated from infected cells. These results suggest that a native conformation of the cell-associated E 1 glycoproteins may be required for immunological cross-reactivity (immune precipitation), whereas virion but not cell-associated E 1 retains immunological cross-reactivity after denaturation (immunoblot technique). The findings extend our previously published evidence which suggested that alphavirus maturation is accompanied by a change in immunological cross-reactivity with respect to E 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{similarities and}} differences between various actins were explored by use of antisera against purified bovine cardiac actin and chicken embryo brain actin. In double-antibody coprecipitation tests, purified iodinated actins from bovine cardiac muscle, rabbit skeletal muscle, chicken embryo brain, and bovine brain all bound to antiserum against chicken embryo brain actin. This result demonstrates the presence of shared antigenic determinants among these actins. Cardiac actin antiserum, on the other hand, bound cardiac and skeletal actin, but failed to bind significantly either brain actin. In radioimmunoassay, all four unlabeled actins were capable of some degree of inhibition of binding of 125 I-labeled chicken embryo brain actin to <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum.</b> The results confirm the existence of shared or similar antigenic determinants, but also show that the molecules are not antigenically identical. In the cardiac actin radioimmunoassay, unlabeled cardiac and skeletal muscle actins inhibited the binding of 125 I-labeled cardiac actin to <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum,</b> but neither brain actin inhibited the binding. Thus, the muscle actins possess at least one antigenic determinant not expressed by the brain actins, in addition to the shared determinants. Furthermore, cardiac actin and skeletal actin generated different inhibition curves in the cardiac actin radioimmunoassay, demonstrating that, although antigenically related, they are not identical. Correlations with existing sequence data imply that substitutions in only a few residues alter the antigenic properties of actin...|$|E

40|$|In {{search of}} an anti-transcriptase, {{antibody}} was raised in rabbits to partially purified, soluble NS protein present in cytoplasmic extracts of cells infected with the Indiana serotype of vesicular stomatitis (VSInd) virus. This antiserum gave specific reactions of identity by agar immunodiffusion with both cytoplasmic and virion NS protein. NS antiserum also preferentially precipitated NS 3 -H-labeled protein from infected cytoplasmic extracts, whereas anti-whole VSInd virion serum also precipitated N 3 -H-labeled protein from extracts both of infected cytoplasm and virion nucleocapsids. Transcriptase activity of VSInd cytoplasmic or virion-derived nucleocapsids was effectively inhibited by ribonuclease-free immunoglubulin prepared from <b>homologous</b> NSInd <b>antiserum</b> or from anti-whole vesicular stomatitis virus serum. Transcriptase activity of heterologous New Jersey serotype (VSNJ) nucleocapsids and virions was not appreciably affected by anti-NSInd or by anti-whole VSInd virion gamma globulin.

40|$|The {{development}} of increased numbers of antigenic variants which arise when a micro-organism is grown in its <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum</b> may be ascribed to spontaneous mutation and the concurrent inhibition of the parental cell type. Since the variation involves the loss or acquisi-tion of agglutinogens, the primary effect by anti-serum in the inhibition phenomenon {{would appear to}} be the activity of the immune agglutinins. Consequent to the immunological reactivity of the agglutinogen-agglutinin complex, the oxida-tion-reduction potential within the agglutinated mass of cells is reduced (Austrian, 1952). Simul-taneously, the coating of the bacterial surface with antibodies results in partial dehydration in the immediate region of complex formation both outside the cell (Haurowitz, 1950) and inside the cell (Perlman, 1956). The over-all thickening of the cell wall has been observed visually (Tomesik, 1956). Any of these, or other unknown effects could conceivably contribute to the inhibition of the growth of the homologous cell type, but the principal deterrent would be the presence of agglutinins which bring about the formation of the complex. The present report is concerned with the in-creased numbers of antigenic mucoid variants which arise in a population of Escherichia coli strain K- 12 grown in the presence of <b>homologous</b> <b>antiserum.</b> The influence of the immune system to effect this population will be shown to be due to a thermolabile mucoid enhancing antibody which is unrelated to titratable agglutinins...|$|E

40|$|In a study {{involving}} the preparation {{and testing of}} pneumococcus capsular polysaccharide, {{the need for a}} rapid method of assay of preparations of unknown antigenic potency became evident. Most bacterial vaccines are standardized on the basis of cell counts or total nitrogen determinations.

Obviously, neither procedure can be used for the standardization of capsular oarbohydrate preparations. Heidelberger and Kendall (1932) developed a method for the quantitative estimation of specific carbohydrate in solution which is based on the precipitation of this material by <b>homologous</b> type-specific <b>antiserum.</b> By this method, they were able to determine as little as 0. 01 mg of type III pneumococcus polysac-charide.

Although convalescent mouse and rat serum were somewhat inhibitory to M. arthritidis in the absence of macrophages, these sera did not promote active phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages. In fact, the macrophages appeared to protect the mycoplasmas against the inhibitory effects of the antisera by stimulating their growth. Hyperimmune rabbit antiserum against M. arthritidis initiated phagocytic action and resulted in a 50 -fold decrease in numbers of viable mycoplasmas by 6 h. In contrast with M. arthritidis, M. pulmonis rapidly adsorbed to the surface of peritoneal macrophages. Upon addition of specific rabbit antiserum, a rapid decrease in viable organisms occurred, and a more complete destruction of organisms ensued in comparison with M. arthritidis.
