5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} by Bell {{was used in}} the later GAM-63A version of the RASCAL. This improved guidance system decreased the CEP of RASCAL to 1,500 feet (457 m). This system received reference information from the bomber prior to launch. The accuracy claims of the <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> have been questioned by sources., This system could also be used to guide the missile throughout its flight to the target.|$|E

Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining. Gyroscopes can be used to construct gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1950, at {{the start}} of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were {{transferred}} to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. Between 1952 and 1956, von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation. Work on the Redstone led to development of the first high-precision <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> on the Redstone rocket.|$|E
25|$|It {{is powered}} by a single 400 kgf Ukrainian-made, Motor Sich JSC R95-300 {{turbofan}} engine, with pop-out wings for cruising efficiency. It can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300nbsp&ft altitude). After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E

500|$|Four {{test flights}} of the High Virgo missile were conducted. Due to {{development}} problems, {{the first two}} {{did not include the}} <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system,</b> instead they were fitted with a simple autopilot guiding the weapon on a pre-programmed course. Launched from its B-58 carrier aircraft at high altitude and supersonic speed, the initial flight, conducted on September 5, 1958, was a failure when the missile's controls malfunctioned. The second test, three months later, proved more successful, with the missile flying over a range of nearly [...] The third flight test, the following June, utilized the <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> for the first time.

500|$|Joseph Francis Shea (September 5, 1925 [...] February 14, 1999) was an American {{aerospace}} engineer and NASA manager. Born in the New York City borough of the Bronx, he was educated at the University of Michigan, receiving a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics in 1955. After working for Bell Labs {{on the radio}} <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile, {{he was hired by}} NASA in 1961. As Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea {{played a key role in}} shaping the course of the Apollo program, helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting [...] "all up" [...] testing of the Saturn V rocket. While sometimes causing controversy within the agency, Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as [...] "one of the greatest systems engineers of our time".|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Shea took {{a position}} at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. [...] There he first worked as systems engineer on the radio guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> of the Titan II ICBM. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, {{a new type of}} engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He {{played a significant role in}} the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, [...] "e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system." [...] In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.|$|E
2500|$|Klass wrote some of {{the first}} {{articles}} on <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>systems,</b> infrared missile <b>guidance,</b> and microelectronics.

50|$|<b>Inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>systems</b> were {{originally}} developed for rockets. American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard experimented with rudimentary gyroscopic systems. Dr. Goddard's systems were {{of great interest}} to contemporary German pioneers including Wernher von Braun.

500|$|Three missile {{systems were}} {{developed}} to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis. Recognizing the need for tactical nuclear missile mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by {{the production of a}} second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment. The missile itself weighs [...] and is [...] long. Using a simplified <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> and a solid propellant rocket motor, the Pluton has a maximum range of [...] The second missile system is the AMX-30R (Roland) surface-to-air missile launching system, which began development in 1974. Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year. The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland's exploration radar has a detection range of [...] The third missile system, called the AMX-30SA, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 Shahine, developed and manufactured by Thomson-CSF; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} to the ICBM programme, the United States developed three separate intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems. On 8 November 1955, Wilson approved IRBM projects by both the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF). The United States National Security Council gave the ICBM and IRBM projects the highest national priority. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency, commanded by Major General John B. Medaris, with Wernher von Braun as its technical director, developed the Jupiter (SM-78) IRBM. After three failures, its first successful flight {{took place at the}} Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 31 May 1957. The United States Navy initially participated in the Jupiter programme, intending to launch the missiles from ships, but in view of their size, decided instead to develop [...] a smaller, solid-propellant IRBM that could be launched from a submarine, which became Polaris. Despite reluctance on the part of Major General Bernard Schriever, the commander of the USAF Western Development Division, to take on IRBM development, and a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for missiles among senior USAF [...] officers, who preferred manned bombers, the rival USAF project moved quickly. The Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the contract {{for the development of the}} missile, which was codenamed Thor (SM-75), in December 1955. Rocketdyne, Ramo-Wooldridge, AC Spark Plug, Bell Laboratories and General Electric were engaged as the subcontractors for the rocket engine, technical coordination, <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system,</b> radio guidance system, and re-entry vehicle respectively. The first missile was delivered to Patrick Air Force Base on 26 October 1956. After four unsuccessful attempts, the first successful test flight took place on 20 September 1957.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{changes were}} made to improve the Mercury-Redstone's reliability. [...] The {{standard}} Redstone's ST-80 <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> was replaced in the Mercury-Redstone with the simpler LEV-3 autopilot.
