50|$|Matt Smith, {{writing on}} Crikey.com praised the show, {{saying it was}} smart, funny, and {{interesting}} all at once. It's well-scripted and Tony Martin and Ed Kavalee are entertaining hosts. Andrew Williams of 6PR radio, praised the show saying the opening segment (of episode 1) was funnier than a whole episode of Good News World. These <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> natural easy chemistry that just works. He also commented that the show felt a little awkward at times but overall was charming. Joey Alcock on imdb.com wrote that the show gave the hosts great leeway to create humorous moments {{and most of the}} gags hit the mark. Arguably the most compelling edge that The Joy of Sets has is Martin's extensive knowledge of television shows, and particularly some of the more obscure and often esoteric moments in TV history. He did comment on the disproportionately high number of longterm fans of Martin's and Kavalee's previous work (particularly Get This) amongst the live audience which he believed prompted the hosts to sometimes overly rely on legacy material and in-jokes.|$|E

[...] "The difference with this song and the video is that it's much simpler and much more about getting the song ingrained in your mind, thus {{was a very different}} thing." [...] "When we made the video, it was kind of the release after the high production of 'Thinking 'Bout Somethin', [...] " [...] Taylor explained. [...] "With the 'Give a Little' video, it's almost back to the blank slate. We invited all these dancers. We just set up a room, cranked up the music and threw a party and let people dance. The attitude is not about everyone doing the same moves; it's about putting a unique twist." [...] "There's this energy to it," [...] Taylor said. [...] "Strangely, there's this dance theme. We're not known for our dancing, but dancing is this metaphor that's in the record. Kind of, 'Get out there and let loose.' ...|$|E
