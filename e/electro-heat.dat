40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) EIS simulation {{approach was}} developed by solving a SOFC unit cell model with imposed sinusoidal voltage perturbations at different frequencies. The transient SOFC unit cell model describes the intricate interdependency among the ionic/electronic conduction, multi-component species transport, electrochemical reaction processes and electrode microstructure {{as well as the}} coupling processes of mass, energy, momentum transport within flow channels. The model calculates the local transient response and impedance spectra as a function of channel position. The effects of the reaction depletion, product accumulation as well as the temperature variation along the flow channels on the EIS spectra was numerically simulated with a counter-flow mode. The results show that the convection-diffusion process along the flow channel has significant effects on the low frequency circle of the impedance spectra. The temperature oscillations accumulate along the flow channels, and then affect the current response which probably leads to <b>electro-heat</b> impedance effects...|$|E
40|$|Innovative heating {{research}} on cooking, pasteurization/sterilization, defrosting, thawing and drying, often focuses on areas {{which include the}} assessment of processing time, evaluation of heating uniformity, studying the impact on quality attributes of the final product as well as considering the energy efficiency of these heating processes. During the last twenty years, so-called electro-heating-processes (radio-frequency - RF, microwaves - MW and ohmic - OH) gained a wide interest in industrial food processing and many applications using the above mentioned technologies have been developed {{with the aim of}} reducing processing time, improving process efficiency and, in many cases, the heating uniformity. In the area of innovative heating, <b>electro-heating</b> accounts for a considerable portion of both the scientific literature and commercial applications, which can be subdivided into either direct <b>electro-heating</b> ({{as in the case of}} OH heating) where electrical current is applied directly to the food or indirect <b>electro-heating</b> (e. g. MW and RF heating) where the electrical energy is firstly converted to electromagnetic radiation which subsequently generates heat within a product. New software packages, which make easier solution of PDEs based mathematical models, and new computers, capable of larger RAM and more efficient CPU performances, allowed an increasing interest about modelling transport phenomena in systems and processes - as the ones encountered in food processing - that can be complex in terms of geometry, composition, boundary conditions but also - as in the case of <b>electro-heating</b> assisted applications - in terms of interaction with other physical phenomena such as displacement of electric or magnetic field. This paper deals with the description of approaches used in modelling transport phenomena in a multi-physics context such as RF, MW and OH assisted heating...|$|R

Recently, cold gelation ability of whey protein isolate (WPI) is taking interest in protection and delivery of value-added bioactive compounds through micro and nano-association techniques. This study aims to combine an <b>electro-heating</b> treatment at moderate electric fields (MEF) together with cold gelation ability of whey proteins in order to reduce size of protein aggregates at nano-scale and improve association efficiency of riboflavin. Divalent iron cation assisted cold gelation of <b>electro-heated</b> WPI and effects of MEF on the produced hydrogels were reported and encouraged during this experimental research. Particle size was characterized, through dynamic light scattering. While spectrofluorimetric analyses were performed in order to examine the effects of MEF and cold induced gelation on the association of riboflavin within WPI hydrogel network structure. Under MEF application smaller sized particles were produced and riboflavin association efficiencies ranged from 40 to 60 %. Results also show that MEF treatment allowed producing WPI nano-hydrogels with associated riboflavin less susceptible to light oxidation. This novel approach that combines <b>electro-heating</b> treatment together with cold gelation can be used to design and develop entirely biodegradable whey protein-based gels as potential devices for controlled release of riboflavin. MEF can be used to improve or create novel applications not only in food and bioprocessing industries, but also in the pharmaceutical area...|$|R

40|$|During {{the latest}} decade, much {{research}} on Ohmic Heating (OH) as <b>electro-heating</b> {{technology has been}} addressed, {{and the effects of}} its moderate electric fields (MEF) have been addressed aiming at fighting pathogens and improving the nutritional and sensory properties of food. In this piece of research, MEF appeared to be an interesting biotechnological tool for food processing, as well as to be used in bioprocesses at large. Our results show that the presence of MEF during heating contributes to a change in protein aggregation kinetics, as well {{in the shape of the}} aggregates obtained, thus highlighting the influence of non-thermal effects. Transmission electron microscopy unveiled that MEF can be used to transform e. g. whey products, containing mainly lactoglobulin in their composition, into in vitro small nano-fibrils which can attract the interest of biomedical sciences. <b>Electro-heating</b> treatment can be designed together with cold gelation for development of entirely biodegradable whey protein-based gels as potential devices for incorporation of nutraceuticals i. e. up to 60 % of association efficiency, thus creating novel applications for both food and pharmaceutical industries. Electrical and thermal effects were optimized into a single step treatment to enhance thermal stabilization (i. e. inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes) and extraction of added-value or bioactive compounds (i. e. anthocyanins and phenolic compounds) from plant and fruit tissues. High frequency (25 kHz) and electric field (30 V/cm), combined with high temperatures (up to 90 ºC) were well suited for a significant effect (p < 0. 05) upon extraction of phenolic compounds. The <b>electro-heating</b> capacity of applying high heating rates with an accurate temperature control, together with putative electroporation effects on cell tissues (due to presence of alternating electric fields), put forward an interesting solution as processing technology toward biorefinery systems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electro-heating</b> {{has often}} been claimed to {{interfere}} with distribution of molecular secondary structure of whey protein isolate (WPI) networks due {{to the presence of}} a moderate electric field (MEF). Recently, cold gelation ability of WPI is also taking interest in protection and delivery of value-added bioactive compounds through micro and nano-association techniques. Hence, the aim of this work is producing cold-set hydrogels from WPI through combined application of an <b>electro-heating</b> treatment followed by cold gelation. Protein dispersions were heated under the absence and presence of MEF at denaturation temperatures (> 80 °C). Divalent iron cation (Fe 2 +) assisted cold gelation of <b>electro-heated</b> WPI and the effects of MEF on the produced hydrogels were reported and encouraged during this research. Nano-scale phenomena of WPI thermal aggregation as affected by applied MEF were assessed by dynamic light scattering technique. To shed more light on the produced protein hydrogels, samples were investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy and rheology techniques. Results shows that apparent viscosity values and protein aggregation decreased with increasing MEF intensity applied (i. e. treatments at 10 V/cm have determined an average particle sizes below 100 nm). Fe 2 + addition resulted in the formation of a network mediated via interactions between cationic agents and WPI soluble aggregates. MEF and cold gelation can induces changes from a nanometer to micrometer range thus offering a great potential to the development of whey protein hydrogels with tailored mechanical and microstructural features Acknowledgments: Ricardo N.

Many applications using the above-mentioned technologies {{have been developed}} {{with the aim of}} reducing processing time, improving process efficiency, and, in many cases, increasing the heating uniformity of the food product being processed, both at domestic and industrial levels. As competition in the global market has grown, the time of conception, prototyping, and validation of new systems based on <b>electro-heating</b> (especially MW) has been reduced due to the continued need for manufacturers to improve their products (as, for example, better performing combined MW ovens for domestic purposes, or particularly efficient MW continuous dryers for industrial purposes). In this scenario, the use of mathematical modeling and virtual prototyping as design tools allows a considerable savings of both time of processing and engineering costs. In fact, modeling experts can make a valuable contributions to the development of new products to enter the market for domestic and industrial supplies by providing very specific and targeted responses to innovation challenges. In this presentation, simple but effective case studies will be addressed spanning solutions for research presented in the literature to niche applications. In addition, it will be discussed if and how multiphysics mathematical modeling can drive innovation in very specific applications, such as mild-drying, devoted to processing of high-added-value food product...|$|R
40|$|The 19 th Gums & Stabilisers for the Food Industry Conference: Hydrocolloid multifunctionalityOhmic heating is {{currently}} being used by food industry as an alternative for the conventional thermal processing of several types of foods. Thus, the way how electrical fields affect functional and nutritional aspects of important food ingredients {{still needs to be}} ascertained. During the last decade, the effects of <b>electro-heating</b> treatments and its moderate electric fields (MEF) has been addressed with a view to functionalize whey protein systems. Whey proteins present an interesting set of technological, functional and biological properties being thus considered as an important dietary food ingredient. In this research it was demonstrated that MEF appears an interesting processing tool acting like a chaperon towards heat unfolding, aggregation and gelation of whey proteins. Results show that the presence of <b>electro-heating</b> contributes to a thermodynamic change in protein denaturation kinetics leading to lower values of reaction order (n) and rate constant (k) (p < 0. 05), when compared to those of conventional heating under equivalent heating rates and holding times. Application of MEF provides also a fast, homogenous and direct way of heating (Joule effect) reducing the size of protein aggregates from 300 nm to 170 nm (p < 0. 05), and thus affecting thermal aggregation and also morphology of protein aggregates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) discloses the appearance of small fibrillar structures at nano-scale size (< 200 nm) upon the influence of MEF. These fibril-like structures have recognized potential to form hydrocolloid gels, act as thickeners in foods or be also used as carrier for the transport of bioactive or functional ingredients. <b>Electro-heating</b> treatment can be designed together with gelation at room temperature induced by salt addition (also known by cold gelation) for the development of entirely biodegradable whey protein isolate gel as potential carrier of divalent iron (Fe 2 +). Results have shown that ca. 33 mmol. L 1 of Fe 2 + can be associated to a WPI gel network. Application of MEF provides an opportunity for the development of innovative functional foods that can be used as an oral dietary supplement. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{sintering}} method, {{named as}} coupled multi-physical fields activation technology, {{has been introduced}} for the forming of various material powder systems. Compared with the conventional ones, this technique presents more advantages: lower sintering temperature, shorter forming time, and remarkable inhibition of the grains coarsening. In the study, the cylinders of Φ 4. 0 mm× 4. 0 mm had been formed with ultrafine WC- 6 Co powders. The relative properties of sintered WC- 6 Co cemented carbides, such as hardness and the microstructures, had been obtained. The study has shown that a relative density, 97. 80 %, of the formed samples, could been achieved when the case of temperature 850 ℃, heating rate 50 ℃/s, pressure 75 MPa and <b>Electro-heating</b> loop 6 times, were used. More importantly, the circumscription {{for the growth of}} grain size of WC, attributed to the effect of electrical field, renders coupled multi-physical fields activation technology applicable for getting WC- 6 Co cemented carbides with fine grain size and good properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{energy saving}} Leidenfrost {{levitation}} method is introduced to transport micro-droplets with virtually frictionless {{contact between the}} liquid and solid substrate. By micro-engineering the heating units, selective areas of the whole substrate can be electro-thermally activated. A droplet can be levitated {{as a result of}} the Leidenfrost effect, and further transported when the substrate is tilted slightly. The selective <b>electro-heating</b> produces a uniform temperature distribution on the heating units within 1 s, in response to a triggering voltage. Alongside these experimental observations, finite element simulations are conducted to understand the temperature profile of the selective heated substrate, and also generate phase diagrams to verify the Leidenfrost regime for different substrate materials. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of controlling low friction high speed droplet transportation (~ 65 mm/s) when the substrate is tilted (~ 7 °) by structurally designing the substrate.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of tomatoes (vitamins, carotenoids and phenolic compounds) is inevitably decreased during processing. Use of high lycopene cultivars, alternative <b>electro-heating</b> technologies and transformation in specific products, can potentially be exploited {{to get a}} final product with still a high {{nutritional value}}. Industrial samples of aseptically packed tomato pulp and diced tomatoes, obtained from normal or high lycopene cultivars, and stabilised with conventional or ohmic thermal treatment, were, then, analysed for the functional profile. In particular, the total phenolic content (TPC) (expressed as gallic acid equivalents, GAE, based on the Folin-Ciocalteu assay), the lycopene content and antioxidant capacity AC (using the ABTS+ assay), were analysed. TPC ranged from 384 to 563 mgGAE/kgproduct and from 556 to 789 mgGAE/ 100 gTotal Solids. The lycopene content ranged from 80 to 140 mg/kgproduct and from 123 to 200 mg/ 100 gTotal Solids. The lycopene fraction contributed, on an average, 80 % of the products AC. Processing of high lycopene cultivars and transformation into pulp rather than diced tomatoes, did not significantly influence the evaluated functional profile. Only ohmic heating (with a 74 % shorter holding time at a 8 % higher temperature than conventional heating) showed a significant and {{positive effect on the}} AC of the lycopene fraction. AC of ohmic treated pulp samples was almost 100 % higher than for the conventionally treated pulp...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic {{solar energy}} is {{considered}} one of the most versatile and promising renewable energy technology. It is based on the use of an infinite source of energy: the sun. The photovoltaic energy conversion process is emission free and the total environmental footprint of photovoltaic energy is very low. Crystalline silicon is the most widely diffused technology among all the photovoltaic for its high efficiency, a well-established manufacturing process that permit the adoption of scale economies and an overall low levelized cost of energy. Along the PV production chain research activities can be conducted on the development of novel cells, as well as on the optimization of process steps with the aim of obtaining better products at low cost and with reduced environmental impact. Following these objectives the knowledge acquired on the development of electrothermal processes of materials allowed the development of two applications of <b>electro-heating</b> for improving the PV production chain. In particular an induction heating directional solidification furnace for growing multi-crystalline silicon ingots had been developed and a lab scale prototype had been built for making experimental tests aimed at the improvement of the silicon ingots production process; an electrothermal process for the treatment of end-of-life PV modules based on radio frequency heating has also been developed and constructed. Both the applications developed can be considered a technological breakthrough that could have a benefic impact on the multi-crystalline silicon production chai...|$|R
40|$|Towards 2020, future energy {{scenarios}} predict {{an excessive}} penetration of distributed generation (DG) in low voltage (LV) networks {{as well as}} a significant uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and <b>electro-heating.</b> The Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in UK will face significant challenges towards this de-carbonised electricity generation and consumption shift. The deployment of these so-called low carbon technologies (LCTs) will impact the performance of the distribution network in such way where solutions will be needed to maintain capacity, reliability and the availability of the electricity supply to customers. The practise to put more copper on the ground – reinforcement - in order to facilitate these changes is found to be expensive and disruptive to the public and business. An innovative solution proposed in this thesis is to increase the voltage along the distribution feeders and step it back down at a customer’s premises. Results show that a significant increase at the hosting capacity of the existing network can be achieved and power quality problems such as overvoltage caused by DG can be avoided. The voltage step-down device, which is termed a voltage control unit (VCU), is to be located in the meter-box of each house. This location raises challenges round the temperature rise in the box caused by VCU losses, and the subsequent effect on the electricity meter and cut-out fuse. It also imposes constraints on the size and weight of the VCU so that a very high efficiency design is required, with high power density and small mass. The optimum VCU design was found to be a power electronic AC Chopper using new Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and diodes. The technology was demonstrated by designing, constructing and testing two interleaved, parallel operation, 1 kW AC Chopper modules. Results from the prototype were compared against Spice simulation results and theory and confirmed that the target efficiency of 99 % was achieved...|$|R
