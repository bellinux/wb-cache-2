40|$|The {{presence}} of flexibility in automotive drivelines, coupled with nonlinear {{elements such as}} gear lash leads to the {{presence of}} an undesirable oscillatory acceleration response to step changes in throttle input. This oscillation is generally low frequency (approximately 2 – 5 kHz) and can be of sufficient amplitude to cause driver discomfort and subjective disappointment with the driveability of the vehicle. A pole placement controller is developed for a ‘‘drive-by-wire’’ (<b>electronically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>throttle)</b> system, with the objective of reducing or eliminating the oscillatory response. The results of an existing factorial study are used to calculate the required number of poles. Due to the inherent nonlinearities present in the system and the various constraints which must be applied to the controller design, the polynomial values for the pole placement controller are selected by the application of multi- objective optimisation. The controller is shown to achieve excellent performance and robustness to parameter variations and operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a controller {{for use in}} speed control of an internal combustion engine for series-hybrid electric vehicle applications. Particular reference is made to {{the stability of the}} rectified DC link voltage under load disturbance. In the system under consideration, the primary power source is a four-cylinder normally aspirated gasoline internal combustion engine, which is mechanically coupled to a three-phase permanent magnet AC generator. The generated AC voltage is subsequently rectified to supply a lead-acid battery, and permanent magnet traction motors via three-phase full bridge power electronic inverters. Two complementary performance objectives exist. Firstly to maintain the internal combustion engine at its optimal operating point, and secondly to supply a stable 42 V supply to the traction drive inverters. Achievement of these goals minimises the transient energy storage requirements at the DC link, with a consequent reduction in both weight and cost. These objectives imply constant velocity operation of the internal combustion engine under external load disturbances and changes in both operating conditions and vehicle speed set-points. An <b>electronically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>throttle</b> allows closed loop engine velocity control. System time delays and nonlinearities render closed loop control design extremely problematic. A model-based controller is designed and shown to be effective in controlling the DC link voltage, resulting in the well-conditioned operation of the hybrid vehicle...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{followed}} {{the development of}} an <b>electronically</b> <b>operated</b> water control system, using a structured product development process and incorporating a major theme of inclusive design. Three project objectives were identified for this project: 1. Use the Product Development Process to successfully develop an <b>electronically</b> <b>operated</b> water control system to a stage that is near ready for manufacture. 2. To understand and implement an inclusive design approach to {{the development of an}} <b>electronically</b> <b>operated</b> water control system to ensure that the product is usable by people regardless of age or ability. 3. To understand to what effect design decisions, related to the usability of a product, have upon the desirability of the product to all users. The product development process used in the development of this product was successful. It resulted in an innovative new product idea that has associated intellectual property, currently under patent application. The product was identified as both usable to people {{with a wide range of}} impairments and desirable to a majority of all potential users. The research methodology relating to inclusive design resulted in the finding that some design decisions relating to the usability of products do in fact affect the desirability of the product to other potential users, and hence could potentially affect the financial success of the product. A set of activities were identified from the process used in this case study and recommended for further product development projects, which will help to ensure that the product is made more usable while still retaining its desirability.
