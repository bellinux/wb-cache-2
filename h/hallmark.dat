5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the <b>hallmark</b> sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a <b>hallmark</b> of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|During {{his five}} {{years with the}} Indians he was {{primarily}} used as a starting pitcher, although he did display the versatility that would become his <b>hallmark.</b> He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early evidence of his versatility is demonstrated by his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom (UK), the <b>Hallmarking</b> Act 1973 {{makes it}} an offence to {{describe}} as platinum, gold or silver an item which is not <b>hallmarked</b> as appropriate or exempt from <b>hallmarking.</b> In July 2009, following a proposal by the British <b>Hallmarking</b> Council, {{an amendment to the}} Act also brought palladium under the <b>hallmarking</b> regime.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{consequence}} of the Act was {{the formation of the}} British <b>Hallmarking</b> Council (BHC). This council is responsible for advising the Secretary of State in matters of <b>hallmarking,</b> making certain the UK has acceptable <b>hallmarking</b> facilities, and overseeing the Assay Offices so they follow the legal <b>hallmarking</b> standards. The council has made many important contributions concerning UK <b>hallmarking</b> procedures. In 1992, the European Commission proposed a Directive meant to cover <b>hallmarking.</b> The BHC examined the document and found multiple areas of ambiguity and deficiency. When the European Parliament voted on the Council’s recommendations, many were approved.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>hallmarking</b> in the Swiss territories {{dates back}} to Geneva in the 15th century there was no uniform system of <b>hallmarking</b> in Switzerland until 1881. Before that time, <b>hallmarking</b> was {{undertaken}} {{at the local level}} by the Swiss cantons. With the introduction of the Swiss system of <b>hallmarking</b> in 1881, there was uniformity throughout the nation.|$|R
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a <b>hallmark</b> was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Mom and Dad, Babb renamed his company <b>Hallmark</b> Productions, {{continuing}} the marketing approaches of Hygienic Productions while going beyond health and sex education films. He would later set up a larger distribution company, named Hallmark's Big-6.|$|E
5|$|Impex {{acted as}} a front for Fatah, serving as a meeting place and conduit for funds. This became a <b>hallmark</b> of Abu Nidal's career. Companies {{controlled}} by the ANO made him a rich man by engaging in legitimate business deals, while acting as cover for arms deals and mercenary activities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hallmarks</b> for gold, palladium, {{platinum}} {{and silver}} from Poland. Official Polish <b>hallmarks</b> between 1963 and 1986 ...|$|R
50|$|Dutch <b>hallmarks</b> are {{recognized}} in Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom without further testing and {{have also been}} recognized in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which have voluntary <b>hallmarking</b> systems. All jewelry produced in the Netherlands or imported for the Dutch market must carry <b>hallmarks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hallmarking</b> Regulations 1998 and The <b>Hallmarking</b> Order 1998 {{caused the}} legitimisation of <b>hallmarks</b> of {{other member states}} (those {{countries}} that ratified the Convention on the Control of Articles of Precious Metals of 1972). The council was responsible for clearing up ambiguous statements in the regulations and for extending its definition to deal with other problems in the <b>hallmarking</b> law. Some of these changes include seven additional standards of fineness, {{a change in the}} standard mark, and the dropping of the date requirement on marked metals.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Amahl was colorcast. The opera {{claims the}} distinctions {{of being the}} first opera written for television, the first {{presentation}} of the teleseries <b>Hallmark</b> Hall of Fame, and the first Christmas television special to become an annual tradition. The opera was telecast on NBC from 1951 to 1966 with many of the original cast and crew participating.|$|E
5|$|Months {{after the}} {{hurricane}} season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review {{of the season and}} its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm corethe <b>hallmark</b> of a subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, one <b>hallmark</b> of the 1950s was the {{beginning}} of European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 Burton won the United Kingdom Jeweller Award {{for best}} design in silver. Burton {{had the first}} piece of {{platinum}} to be <b>hallmarked</b> at the London Assay Office in 1973 when <b>hallmarking</b> for platinum was introduced under the <b>Hallmarking</b> Act of 1973 and platinum became a recognized metal under the Vienna Convention on the Control of the Fineness and the <b>Hallmarking</b> of Precious Metal Objects. This piece is at Goldsmiths' Hall. She became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|In 1424, the French I Jean de Brogny, after {{consulting}} a council of eight Master Goldsmiths from Geneva, enacted a regulation on the purity and <b>hallmarking</b> of silver objects, following the French standards, for application in Geneva. Although gold was certainly used for articles, the regulation was silent on standards and <b>hallmarking</b> for gold.(In Switzerland today, only precious metal watch cases must be <b>hallmarked.</b> Perhaps this {{attests to the}} significance of watches to the Swiss economy. The <b>hallmarking</b> of other items including silverware and jewelry is optional.) ...|$|R
50|$|There is one assay {{office at}} Praha.Assay Office was {{established}} by the Czech National Council Law No. 19/1993 Coll., concerning the Administration Authorities of the Czech Republic in the Field of <b>Hallmarking</b> and Precious Metal Testing, from which the Assay Office competences and duties are resulting. The provision of the financing {{is included in the}} Law about <b>Hallmarking</b> and Precious Metal Testing (<b>Hallmarking</b> Act), No. 539/1992 Coll., and in the procedural Decree of the Federal Ministry of Economy (FME), No. 540/1992 Coll., according to which the <b>Hallmarking</b> Act is implemented.|$|R
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the <b>hallmark</b> symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|The strictest {{forms of}} Jain diet are practised by the monastic ascetics. It also {{excludes}} potatoes and other root vegetables. The scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, {{and especially to}} food, shapes their entire lives and {{is the most significant}} <b>hallmark</b> of Jain identity.|$|E
5|$|While {{relaying}} the deteriorated {{floor of}} Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed {{belonging to the}} British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the <b>hallmark</b> of Mughals.|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch {{government}} markets their assay services/office as the [...] "Jewellery Gateway {{in and to}} Europe." [...] The Netherlands' <b>hallmarks</b> {{are also}} recognized in other E.U. countries and thus can be sold in Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom without further testing. The Netherlands' <b>hallmarks</b> are also recognized in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which have voluntary <b>hallmarking</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|The Assay Office {{primarily}} {{tests and}} <b>hallmarks</b> precious metal. In 1973 the modern <b>Hallmarking</b> Act 1973 was passed, then in 2010 palladium became the fourth precious metal to be assayed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hallmarks</b> {{are applied}} {{with a hammer}} and punch, a process that leaves sharp edges and spurs of metal. Therefore, <b>hallmarking</b> is {{generally}} done before the piece goes for its final polishing.|$|R
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring <b>hallmark</b> of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was a <b>hallmark</b> of Rockwell's wartime work. In Rockwell's prime {{and at the}} peak of its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was a real person. Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|E
5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} <b>hallmark</b> of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in {{that they were not}} part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
50|$|The British <b>Hallmarking</b> Council (BHC) is the {{organisation}} responsible for supervising <b>hallmarking</b> in the United Kingdom. It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).|$|R
5000|$|An {{article in}} the Journal of Biosciences in 2013 argued that {{original}} data for most of these <b>hallmarks</b> is lacking. [...] It argued that cancer is a tissue-level disease and these cellular-level <b>hallmarks</b> are misleading.|$|R
25|$|They {{argue that}} it was in San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland that the <b>hallmarks</b> of the Olmec culture were first established, <b>hallmarks</b> that include the patio/plaza concept, monumental sculpture, Olmec iconography, archetypical Olmec figurines, and other {{portable}} art.|$|R
5|$|Baroness Lehzen {{has been}} portrayed {{numerous}} times in film and television. She was played by Renée Stobrawa in the 1936 German film Mädchenjahre einer Königin, Greta Schröder {{in the films}} Victoria the Great and Sixty Glorious Years, Barbara Everest in 1941's The Prime Minister, Magda Schneider in the 1954 television serial The Story of Vickie, Olga Fabian in an episode of <b>Hallmark</b> Hall of Fame, Patience Collier in Edward the Seventh, Diana Rigg in the 2001 television serial Victoria & Albert, Jeanette Hain in the 2009 film The Young Victoria and Daniela Holtz in the 2016 television serial Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he {{supplies}} 007 with {{a modified}} Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond {{that became a}} <b>hallmark</b> of the series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, {{with the exception of}} Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a <b>hallmark</b> of well made fried chicken.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>hallmarks</b> {{were applied}} by a trusted party: the 'guardians of the craft' or more {{recently}} by an assay office. <b>Hallmarks</b> are {{a guarantee of}} certain purity or fineness of the metal, as determined by official metal (assay) testing.|$|R
50|$|They {{argue that}} it was in San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland that the <b>hallmarks</b> of the Olmec culture were first established, <b>hallmarks</b> that include the patio/plaza concept, monumental sculpture, Olmec iconography, archetypical Olmec figurines, and other {{portable}} art.|$|R
50|$|The {{mandatory}} {{status of}} <b>hallmarking</b> gold jewellery sold in India, although declared, {{is yet to}} be implemented. But it has a wide acceptance among consumers. This often leads to fake <b>hallmarking</b> of jewellery which is under the regular scrutiny of the bureau.|$|R
