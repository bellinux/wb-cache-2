5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> left the island and said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E

5|$|While {{lacking in}} the social qualities common to politicians, one {{characteristic}} served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters and opponents both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive. Cobb concluded that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been more impressed with a man's intellect {{than he had been}} with Goebel's.|$|E
5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E

After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008. That was accomplished with the help of Ross Perot, who had met him at a history seminar in 2001, and who intervened in 2008 with the White House regarding a final resting place.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 {{in favor of}} new wave, Kijak was {{immediately}} drawn to the band's music, surprised <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard it before.
