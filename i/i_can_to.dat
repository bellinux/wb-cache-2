5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>to</b> inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

In London during the Blitz, he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask (until Churchill gave him some), visiting bomb shelters. Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at 10 Downing Street and had him as a guest at Chequers. In his writings, Churchill recalled [...] "a long talk with this most able and forceful man".|$|E

500|$|The fifth {{season of}} American Idol used [...] "Bad Day" [...] to {{underscore}} {{a montage of}} each contestant shown when they were eliminated. Although {{it was not his}} decision to have it on the show, Powter said: [...] "I need every opportunity that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> get the music out there". [...] "Bad Day" [...] was subsequently used in other shows, including the Brazilian series Malhação in 2005, and TV Asahi's 2006 Japanese drama Regatta: Kimi to Ita Eien. It was featured in Veronica Mars episode [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] in 2007, and in a 2012 episode of the German show Danni Lowinski.

500|$|The {{next morning}} Tarwater boarded {{a plane and}} headed home. Later that day, Phelps, facing the {{prospect}} of competing in eight events at the Olympics, elected to drop the 200-meter freestyle from his program. Phelps' decision allowed Tarwater to move up into the sixth spot in the 200-meter freestyle and {{be added to the}} relay team. Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night. [...] I was in peace and left with my faith intact. [...] To have this extra bout of joy is... surreal", he said. He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha, where the Trials were held, for a team meeting and practice. He told Olympic swim coach Gregg Troy, [...] "you won't see anyone show up with more focus and fire.... I will do everything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> bolster the U.S. team." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{live at the}} Holland Festival on June18, 2010, in the Muziekgebouw aan'tIJ. The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... Maybe because of the language barrier, maybe because it’s not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when he wrote this piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice." ...|$|E

500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> make it look good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E
