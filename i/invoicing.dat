25|$|The Metropolitan Region of Recife has {{the second}} largest medical pool in Brazil, after São Paulo. Together they make up 417 {{hospitals}} and clinics with 72,000 employees in the Metro Area and more than 120,000 in the State of Pernambuco. The medical pool offers a total of 8,990 beds and, according to the Union of the Hospitals of Pernambuco, recorded in the year 2000 an <b>invoicing</b> of R$220million (Brazilian Reals). It is thanks to the pool that Pernambuco has access to more computed tomography devices than more developed countries such as Canada or France.|$|E
50|$|<b>Invoice</b> {{processing}} {{involves the}} handling of incoming <b>invoices</b> from arrival to post. <b>Invoices</b> have many variations and types. In general, <b>invoices</b> are grouped into two types:1. <b>Invoices</b> associated with a request or purchase order2. <b>Invoices</b> {{that do not have}} an associated request (no purchase order).|$|R

50|$|From {{the point}} of view of a seller, an <b>invoice</b> is a sales <b>invoice.</b> From {{the point of}} view of a buyer, an <b>invoice</b> is a {{purchase}} <b>invoice.</b> The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term <b>invoice</b> indicates money is owed or owing.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War there arose {{a debate}} {{regarding}} the Coast Guards scope. With a diminishing threat from Russia, the navy decided that it would downplay the military role of the Coast Guard. This would allow the Norwegian Fleet and the Coastal Artillery to focus on training while the Coast Guard would focus entirely on its core tasks. In line with the trend of new public management, the government was eager to introduce user payment for the Coast Guard. This would have involved the various civilian agencies, such as the JCRRs, having to pay for Coast Guard services. The Navy argued that a key role of the Coast Guard was a constant presence and that <b>invoicing</b> for use would decrease its efficiency since it had low marginal costs with participating in SAR missions. In the end user payment was abandoned.|$|E

Steve Dalby, iiNet's chief regulatory officer, said: [...] "We are concerned that our customers will be unfairly targeted to settle claims out of court using a practice called 'speculative <b>invoicing.</b> Information of up to 4,700 subscribers were being sought for allegedly downloading the film before its box office release.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of Post {{has also}} {{developed}} software for philatelic inventory management, known as [...] "Philsim". It {{is used for}} all activities relating to philately, including forecasting, indenting, <b>invoicing,</b> monitoring supply and demand and recording sales and revenue for commemorative stamps and other philatelic products at philately bureaus and counters (and definitive stamps and stationery at circle stamp depots and head post offices).|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} an <b>invoice,</b> which in either multivalue or {{relational}} data {{could be seen}} as (A) <b>Invoice</b> Header Table - one entry per <b>invoice,</b> and (B) <b>Invoice</b> Detail Table - one entry per line item. In the multivalue model, we have the option of storing the data as on table, with an embedded table to represent the detail: (A) <b>Invoice</b> Table - one entry per <b>invoice,</b> no other tables needed.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a flaw in}} our {{database}} design above. The <b>Invoice</b> relvar {{contains an}} Order No attribute. So, each tuple in the <b>Invoice</b> relvar will have one Order No, which implies that there is precisely one Order for each <b>Invoice.</b> But in reality an <b>invoice</b> can be created against many orders, or indeed for no particular order. Additionally the Order relvar contains an <b>Invoice</b> No attribute, implying that each Order has a corresponding <b>Invoice.</b> But again {{this is not always}} true in the real world. An order is sometimes paid through several <b>invoices,</b> and sometimes paid without an <b>invoice.</b> In other words, there can be many <b>Invoices</b> per Order and many Orders per <b>Invoice.</b> This is a many-to-many relationship between Order and <b>Invoice</b> (also called a non-specific relationship). To represent this relationship in the database a new relvar should be introduced whose role is to specify the correspondence between Orders and Invoices: ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{organizations}} have clear instructions regarding processing incoming <b>invoices.</b> Different sets of instructions are {{commonly found in}} most organizations regarding the handling of purchase order <b>invoices</b> or non-purchase order <b>invoices.</b> The main department that processes <b>invoices</b> is known as accounts payable department.

60|$|To go to {{our inner}} office in Raggett Street I had to walk through a room in which the typists worked. They were the {{correspondence}} typists; our books and <b>invoicing</b> had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure {{on either side of}} us. I was, I must confess, always in a faintly cloudily-emotional way aware of that collection of for the most part round-shouldered femininity, but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention. I appreciated her at first as a straight little back, a neater back than any of the others; as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls; as chestnut hair very neatly done--and as a side-long glance; presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me.|$|E
5000|$|Collective <b>Invoicing</b> is {{also known}} as monthly <b>invoicing</b> in Japan. Japanese {{businesses}} tend to have many orders with small amounts because of the outsourcing system (Keiretsu), or of demands for less inventory control (Kanban). To save the administration work, <b>invoicing</b> is normally processed on monthly basis.|$|E
50|$|Electronic <b>Invoicing</b> is not {{necessarily}} the same as EDI <b>invoicing.</b> Electronic <b>invoicing</b> in its widest sense embraces EDI as well as XML invoice messages as well as other format such as pdf. Historically, other formats such as pdf {{were not included in the}} wider definition of an electronic invoice because they were not machine readable and the process benefits of an electronic message could not be achieved. However, as data extraction techniques have evolved and as environmental concerns have begun to dominate the business case for the implementation of electronic <b>invoicing,</b> other formats are now incorporated into the wider definition.|$|E
50|$|Once its {{category}} defined, the <b>invoice</b> is {{forwarded to}} the responsible person {{for that particular}} <b>invoice.</b> This is normally {{the person who has}} placed that order. If there has been a purchase order involved when placing that order, the <b>invoice</b> must then be matched against the purchase order to ensure that the amount <b>invoiced</b> is correctly stated on the <b>invoice.</b> If the amount is right and the goods have arrived, the responsible person will have to approve the <b>invoice</b> by signing off on it. If the amount <b>invoiced</b> exceeds a certain amount that is limited by the organization, the superior of that person may have to approve the <b>invoice</b> as well. This, of course, differs from organization to organization.|$|R
50|$|A sales quote is {{prepared}} {{in the form}} of a pro forma <b>invoice</b> which is different from a commercial <b>invoice.</b> It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of the commercial <b>invoice.</b> The content of a pro forma <b>invoice</b> is almost identical to a commercial <b>invoice</b> and is usually considered a binding agreement although the price may change in advance of the final sale.|$|R
50|$|<b>Invoices</b> are {{different}} from receipts. Both <b>invoices</b> and receipts are ways of tracking purchases of goods and services. In general {{the content of the}} <b>invoices</b> can be similar to that of receipts including tracking the amount of the sale, calculating sales tax owed and calculating any discounts applied to the purchase. <b>Invoices</b> differ from receipts in that <b>invoices</b> serve to notify customers of payments owed, whereas receipts serve as proof of completed payment.|$|R

50|$|As {{companies}} advance {{into the}} digital era, {{more and more}} are switching to electronic <b>invoicing</b> services to automate their accounts payable departments. The 2012 Global E-Invoicing Study illustrated {{the rate at which}} electronic <b>invoicing</b> is growing. According to the study, 73% of respondents used electronic <b>invoicing</b> to some degree in 2012, a 14% increase from 2011. Supplier resistance to e-invoicing has decreased from 46% in 2011 to 26% in 2012. According to a report done by the GXS in 2013, Europe is adopting government legislation encouraging businesses to adopt electronic <b>invoicing</b> practices. The United States treasury estimated that implementing e-invoicing across the entire federal government would reduce costs by 50% and save $450 million annually.|$|E

A pro forma <b>invoice</b> is required to state the same facts that the commercial <b>invoice</b> would and the content is prescribed by the governments who are a party to the transaction.|$|R
