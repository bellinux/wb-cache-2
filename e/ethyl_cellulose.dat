40|$|Cellulose {{derivatives}} containing associating hydrophobic groups {{along their}} hydrophilic backbone {{are used as}} rheology modifiers {{in the formulation of}} water-based spray paints, medicinal sprays, cosmetics and printable inks. Jetting and spraying applications of these materials involve progressive thinning and break-up of a fluid column or sheet into drops. Strong extensional kinematics develop in the thinning fluid neck. In viscous Newtonian fluids, inertial and viscous stresses oppose the surface tension-driven instability. In aqueous solutions of polymers such as <b>Ethyl</b> Hydroxy-Ethyl <b>Cellulose</b> (EHEC), chain elongation provides additional elastic stresses that can delay the capillary-driven pinch-off, influencing the sprayability or jettability of the complex fluid. In this study, we quantify the transient response of thinning filaments of cellulose ether solutions to extensional flows in a Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) and in a forced jet undergoing break-up using Rayleigh Ohnesorge Jetting Extensional Rheometry (ROJER). We also characterize the steady state molecular deformations using measurements of the flow-induced birefringence and excess pressure drop in an extensional stagnation point flow using a Cross-Slot Extensional Rheometer (CSER). We show that under the high extension rates encountered in jetting and spraying, the semi-dilute solutions of hydrophobically modified <b>ethyl</b> hydroxy-ethyl <b>cellulose</b> (hmEHEC) exhibit extensional thinning, while the unmodified bare chains of EHEC display an increase in extensional viscosity, up to a plateau value. For both EHEC and hmEHEC dispersions, the low extensibility of the cellulose derivatives limits the Trouton ratio observed at the highest extension rates attained (close to 10 [superscript 5] s[superscript − 1]) to around 10 – 20. The reduction in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate for the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether is primarily caused by the disruption of a transient elastic network that is initially formed by intermolecular association of hydrophobic stickers. This extensional thinning behavior, in conjunction with the low extensibility of the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether additives, makes these rheology modifiers ideal for controlling the extensional rheology in formulations that require jetting or spraying, with minimal residual stringiness or stranding.

The transmittance versus [SDoD] profiles exhibited bands that, in conjunction with conductivity and surface tension data, gave support to the explanation {{of the behavior of}} EHEC-SDoD-water solutions. Transmittance bands determined in the presence of EHEC and surfactant are sensitive to the process of surfactant to polymer binding. In this process, a discontinuity point represented by a second broader peak in the transmittance plots was identified, implying a slight inhibition of the breakdown of the network process. This is explained as a kind of intermediate re-structural network of the complexes produced by the formation of regular SDoD micelles. It was demonstrated that the second conductivity breakpoint marks the polymer saturation by surfactant clusters, and the effect of the EHEC concentration on the process of binding can be described by a linear correlation when the psp breakpoint is plotted against the polymer concentration.

The model includes heat and mass balances of the reactor, a pressure model, models of PID controllers, the jacket and the condenser. Technical limitations, for instance maximal and minimal jacket temperature changes due to limitations in the heat exchanger, have been modeled as constraints.

An optimization problem is formulated, wherein the total batch time is minimized under the constraints of the differential algebraic equation system and other constraints originating from the process, for instance limited pump capabilities. As a first step in optimizing the operation of the process, a series of simulations has been performed in order to decrease the total batch time.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this Thesis aimed at the study of pre micellar aggregates of anionic and cationic surfactants of variable molecular structure. In the pre micellar region, several fluorescent probes-esters of pyrenoic acid - show an excimer type emission, which is surfactant dependent in that concentration range. A probe effect on the formation and size of these small aggregates was thoroughly studied, by varying its molecular structure and concentration in order to change the molar ration of probe per micellar aggregate. For {{a better understanding of}} the probe micro vicinity in the pre micellar aggregates a solvatochromic study of the probe was carried out in different organic solvents, water and in micelles. The variation of the structural characteristics of the surfactant was also studied by varying the chain length and the nature of the polar group. A dependence on the ionic strength, co-surfactants and temperature was also found. The mixed polymer-surfactant were also studied and it was found that the polymers favours the pre micellar aggregate formation. Due to the association with the polymer, the anionic pre micellar aggregates confer a polyelectrolyte nature to the non ionic polymer and increase the repulsion forces between macromolecules. The polymer concentration at which a molecule establishes interactions with other macromolecules - overlap concentration - depends on the concentration and nature of the surfactants dependent. The polymers investigated were of two types: homogeneous non ionic - polyoxyethylene, POE (M.

40|$|Pseudolatexes were {{obtained}} by a new process based on an emulsification-diffusion technique involving partially water-miscible solvents. The preparation method consisted of emulsifying an organic solution of polymer (saturated with water) in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent (saturated with solvent) using conventional stirrers, followed by direct solvent distillation. The technique relies on the rapid displacement of the solvent from the internal into the external phase which thereby provokes polymer aggregation. Nanoparticle formation is believed to occur because rapid solvent diffusion produces regions of local supersaturation near the interface, and nanoparticles are formed due to the ensuing interfacial phase transformations and polymer aggregation that occur in these interfacial domains.

40|$|Spinach {{ferredoxin}} was {{extracted from}} spinach leaves which were purchased from local markets of Khartoum State in winter season. In this study, spinach ferredoxin was tested as a reducing agent in culture media for growth of anaerobes. The spinach ferredoxin was purified through diethyl amino <b>ethyl</b> (DEAE) - <b>cellulose</b> column chromatography at 4 ºC and was sterilized by filtration. The activity of ferredoxin {{was determined by}} the absorbency measurement (UV. spectrophotometer) in ultraviolet (UV) visible region. Spinach ferredoxin was treated with different degrees of temperature for different times then added to the Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM), which was used for cultivation of Clostridium perfringens. Viable count was conducted and it indicated that ferredoxin activity decreased with temperature. Spinach ferredoxin was added to tubes containing RCM medium, cultured with C. perfringens and incubated for different times (4 - 10 h). All cultures were centrifuged and immediately, redox potential (Eh) of supernatants was measured by platinum electrode. Ferredoxin was detected in samples which were incubated for 10 and 4 hours, which was indicated by Eh readings. In cultures that were incubated for 6 and 8 hours, the Eh readings were not indicated the ferredoxin presence. Also, XII detection of ferredoxin was confirmed by the results of optical density and absorbency. Also the supernatants of cultures incubated for different times were used to support the growth of C. perfringens...|$|R
