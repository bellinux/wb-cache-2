50|$|A <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (also {{known as}} a silage harvester, forager or chopper) is a farm {{implement}} that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|E
50|$|The FR9000’s IntelliFill {{system allows}} the {{operator}} {{to fill a}} trailer accurately and with minimal losses, even when visibility is limited. Following a front-to-rear or rear-to-front pattern, the automatic trailer tracking system uses a specialised 3D camera mounted under the spout to guide the crop flow into the trailer. The system ensures a uniform fill whether the trailer is alongside the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester,</b> or following, {{in the case of}} starting new fields. The system can accurately control the crop flow trajectory even when operating at night. The spout-mounted sensor creates a distance image of the trailer and its surroundings, based on NIR (near infra red) technology. Unlike conventional mono or stereo camera systems, which have poor depth perception, the New Holland tracking system can accurately position the crop flow to a distance of 20 metres.IntelliFill system was awarded with a Gold Medal at Agritechnica in 2009.|$|E
40|$|Many field {{experiments}} {{require the}} collection of forage yields in addition to grain yield (small grains). ln smal! plot research, mechanized grain harvest is common. However, forage harvest is often accomplished by hand which is time consuming and labor intensive. Sample heterogeneity increases when forage harvest is obtained by hand. The objectives {{of this study were}} to construct a mechanized <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> that would simplify the harvesting process while providing a homogenous sample and to determine forage yield reduction associated with using the harvester compared to hand clipping at the soil surface. A John Deere GT 262 self propelled rotary mower was modified to be used for small plot wheat forage harvesting. Field trials were established at two locations to determine the yield reduction associated with using the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> versus hand clipping at the soil surface. Significant differences in yield were found at both locations. The mean dry matter yield averaged over two years and two Iocations obtained using the harvester was 63. 1 % of that obtained by hand clipping at the soil surface during growth stages Feekes 6 and Feekes 10. Total N in wheat forage collected was significantly different using the harvester versus hand clipping. This is partially explained by decreased N in the lower stems at later stages of reproductive growth. The design of the harvester makes it possible to harvest several plots in {{a short amount of time}} while also allowing a larger area to be harvested which increases experimental accuracy and sample homogeneity. When the efficiency of the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (0. 631) is used as a correction factor, the difference between the estimated and actual amounts of forage present is S 4 o/" of the total forage present (Feekes 6 through Feekes 10) ...|$|E

Moench] or pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Hr. ] in 3 ̆c 1 min per plot. Harvested material is deposited in a pile {{in the center of}} each plot.

40|$|In Italy, short {{rotation}} forest {{has become}} very popular in recent years, with over 4, 000 hectares already planted - almost exclusively with clone poplar. The study models the performance of modified <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{on a range of}} short-rotation poplar plantations, identifies technical obstacles to the deployment of these machines and suggests solutions that may expand the capability of modified <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> when treating short-rotation poplar. Data were collected from 16 operations, covering a total of 50 hectares and producing over 1000 green tonnes of wood chips. The average yield of the fields harvested during the trials was about 20 green tonnes/ha year, equivalent to 8 oven-dry tonnes/ha for a 60 % average moisture content, measured in the laboratory. Gross machine productivity ranged from 9 to 44 green tonnes/scheduled machine hour (gt/SMH), with an average value of 25 gt/SMH. Of course, this result is affected by other factors than just forager performance, which is potentially much higher. A model was developed to predict harvesting performance and cost, showing that harvesting cost can be maintained below the 15 Euro/green tonne (2 Euro/GJ) ceiling only if field stocking exceeds 40 or 50 gt/ha when rows are long 300 and 100 m, respectively. The study also shows the need to optimize operations. Over a quarter of the total worksite time is occupied by unproductive delays, which may be reduced with improved planning and maintenance...|$|R
