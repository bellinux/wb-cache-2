Video game otaku with 160,000 individuals and ¥21 billion. Automobile otaku with 140,000 individuals and ¥54 billion. Animation (anime) otaku with 110,000 individuals and ¥20 billion.

50|$|Total {{facility}} power {{consists of}} power used by <b>IT</b> <b>equipment</b> plus any overhead power consumed by {{anything that is}} not considered a computing or data communication device (i.e. cooling, lighting, etc.).

The average data center in the US has a PUE of 2.0, meaning that the facility uses two watts of total power (overhead + <b>IT</b> <b>equipment)</b> for every watt delivered to <b>IT</b> <b>equipment.</b> State-of-the-art data center energy efficiency {{is estimated to be}} roughly 1.2. Some large data center operators like Microsoft and Yahoo! have published projections of PUE for facilities in development; Google publishes quarterly actual efficiency performance from data centers in operation.|$|E
