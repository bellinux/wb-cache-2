The impact of the symmetry breaking caused by the <b>forced</b> <b>rotation</b> on the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) mechanisms is investigated for a Reynolds number equal to 100, based on the cylinder diameter and inflow velocity. The cylinder is found to oscillate freely up to a rotation rate (ratio between the cylinder surface and inflow velocities) close to 4. Under <b>forced</b> <b>rotation,</b> the vibration amplitude exhibits a bell-shaped evolution {{as a function of}} the reduced velocity (inverse of the oscillator natural frequency) and reaches 1. 9 diameters, i. e. three times the maximum amplitude in the non-rotating case. The free vibrations of the rotating cylinder occur under a condition of wake–body synchronization similar to the lock-in condition driving non-rotating cylinder VIV. The largest vibration amplitudes are associated with a novel asymmetric wake pattern composed of a triplet of vortices and a single vortex shed per cycle, the TCS pattern. In the low-frequency vibration regime, the flow exhibits another new topology, the U pattern, characterized by a transverse undulation of the spanwise vorticity layers without vortex detachment; consequently, free oscillations of the rotating cylinder may also develop in the absence of vortex shedding. The symmetry breaking due to the rotation is shown to directly impact the selection of the higher harmonics appearing in the fluid <b>force</b> spectra.

Most traditional studies have analyzed the turbine’s self-starting capability using the experimental and numerical data of the <b>forced</b> <b>rotation.</b> A 2 D numerical model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-Fluent was developed to simulate the self-starting process of the rotor at constant incident water-flow velocities. The vertical-axis turbine (VAT) rotor is driven directly by the resultant torque generated by the water flow and system loads, including the friction and reverse loads of the generator. It is found that the incident flow velocity and the moment of inertia of the rotor have little effect on the averaged values of tip-speed ratios in the equilibrium stage under no-load conditions. In the system load calculations, four modes of the self-starting were found: stable equilibrium mode, unstable equilibrium mode, switch mode and halt mode.

Results show that two models have good performance for prediction about 94 % more accuracy. As for grey relation analysis, normal force is the most important variable to affect the resistance value. It also finds that increasing normal stress causes more friction loss of the parts.

40|$|Abstract. Polishing {{process is}} a primary {{technique}} for planarization of material surface in manufacture fabrication. The pad structure and its material properties are important to determine the polish rate and planarity {{that can be achieved}} by the polishing process. Besides, the pad conditioning is used to regenerate the surface of the polishing pad surface by breaking up the glazed areas. Because the polishing and pad conditioning mechanism is inadequately understood and because higher levels of pad polishing performance are desired, the investigation of experiment becomes more important. In this paper, a high precision polishing machine has established. With an improved design, a test rig can be easily used to simulate the polishing, pad conditioning process and acquire the signals of temperature. The temperature of test pads (i. e.

40|$|In rotary drilling, {{specific}} energy {{is considered to}} be an important parameter for defining mechanical efficiency of the rock destruction process. Specific Energy is defined as the energy required to remove one unit of rock. Specific energy is the function {{of the size of the}} borehole and various operational parameters including feed <b>force,</b> <b>rotation</b> speed, rotation torque and penetration rate. The harder the material, the higher the {{specific energy}}. The traditional method to calculate the specific energy is based on the parameters penetration rate, feed force, torque and rotation speed, that can be provided by Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data from the drill process. In this study, MWD data from an open pit mine in Sweden are used to evaluate data trends among logged parameters and calculated average specific energy. The results show that there is a significant hole length dependency for penetration rate and feed force that affects the predicted specific energy. This may be explained by that the hole cleaning efficiency is reduced with increasing hole length. The analysis shows that the specific energy is over-estimated by 45 % in the bottom of an 18 m hole compared to the collaring point. The suggested solution is to use hole average or complement the specific energy calculation with a hole length related component.

Thus, {{in the current}} study, a three-dimensional multiphase turbulent model was established to study the transport phenomena during centrifugal continuous casting process. The effects of nozzle position, casting and rotational speed on the flow pattern, centrifugal force acting on the molten steel, level fluctuation, gas entrainment, shear stress on mold wall, and motion of inclusions during centrifugal continuous casting process were investigated. Volume of Fluid model was used to simulate the molten steel-air two-phase. The level fluctuation and the gas entrainment during casting were calculated by user-developed subroutines. The trajectory of inclusions in the rotating system was calculated using the Lagrangian approach. The results show that during centrifugal continuous casting, {{a large amount of}} gas was entrained into the molten steel, and broken into bubbles of various sizes. The greater the distance to the mold wall, the smaller the centrifugal <b>force.</b> <b>Rotation</b> speed had the most important influence on the centrifugal force distribution at the side region.

The trajectories of inclusions in the mold were irregular, and then rotated along the strand length.
