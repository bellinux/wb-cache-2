It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|Bone transplants <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> {{successful}} in filling the lesions caused by OFC.

5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|Queer Eyes American success caused {{television}} networks {{in several countries}} to syndicate the American episodes, {{with a number of}} countries creating their own local versions of Queer Eye for broadcast in their countries. However, few of these homegrown versions <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> as successful as the original, and most did not last long before cancellation. Licensing of the format is managed by NBCUniversal.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> to be unpopular.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Griffin {{was convicted}} of distributing {{material}} likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006 he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought {{to distance himself from}} some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.|$|E
5|$|Labrador Retrievers <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> {{to have a}} high {{success rate}} at {{becoming}} guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analyses}} <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> {{these three}} are all distinctive and separate species; other taxa formerly {{believed to be}} unique species or subspecies, such as B.betulicola, B.chippewaensis, B.persoonii, B.quercicola and B.venturii, are now known {{to be part of}} a B.edulis species complex with a wide morphological, ecological and geographic range, and that the genetic variability in this complex is low. Similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify B.edulis and other commercially important fungi.|$|E

5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> to be controversial.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, {{based on the premise that}} inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E

5|$|The Apache was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. The Apache has been an object of controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although {{only a fraction of}} this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.|$|E

Popular video streamers such as PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Jacksepticeye helped the games to receive additional attention through their playthroughs. In May 2015, YouTube reported that playthroughs of the Five Nights at Freddy's series were the eighth most-watched of all video game series on the service.|$|E
