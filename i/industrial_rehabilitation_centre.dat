The findings of the survey are summarized as guidelines (proposals) for the development of Latvian <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres</b> in the context of medical tourism. The main research results are as follows: Latvian <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres</b> offer a wide variety of services, the prices of the services are competitive with European ones, and the clients are satisfied with the quality of services and believe that the quality corresponds with the price. However, Latvian <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres</b> depend on the economical situation of the country and its financial support, {{there is a lack of}} unified standards in Latvia, the Soviet infrastructure dominates and the leisure time activities are limited. The aim of the guidelines is to offer a solution of the problem regarding the possibility to develop <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres</b> in order to foster the medical tourism and the ways how to do it...|$|R

However, our findings suggest that an incorporated family intervention system can be a highly positive influence on the recovery process. We suggest that <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>centres</b> include family members as part of the intervention process, particularly at a later stage of the rehabilitation program.|$|R
