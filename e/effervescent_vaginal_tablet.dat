40|$|Our {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the pharmacokinetics of natural progesterone administered in the novel formula of an <b>effervescent</b> <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet.</b> Fifty post-menopausal women, with a median age of 43. 5 years (range 28 – 55), volunteered to participate in the research. All women discontinued their hormonal replacement therapy 1 month prior to the study. The pharmacokinetics of 50 and 100 mg of progesterone administered as a vaginal tablet were evaluated. After the initial administration of 50 mg or 100 mg, a mean serum Cmax of 20. 43 K 8. 01 nmol/l and 31. 61 K 12. 62 nmol/l (P 40 years were found to have a significantly lower Tmax compared to younger women (P J 0. 02). The continuous use of vaginal progesterone did not influence the hormonal, liver or lipid profiles evaluated. Only three (6 %) women suffered from mild vaginal irritation. Natural progesterone given as a vaginal tablet is well tolerated, safe and an easily administered treatment. Even in a non-oestrogenized vagina the absorption was efficient and the 100 mg dosage resulted in adequate serum progesterone concentrations.

Of vaginal dosage forms, patients are known to better tolerate gels. However, the direct application of gels onto the infected sites of the vagina might be difficult, inconvenient as well as need frequent dosing. Effervescent vaginal tablets offer convenience of dosing methods of tablet and disintegrate rapidly to prevent vaginal clearance due to gravity. Sodium bicarbonate and citric acid were added as effervescent mixture, to increase disintegration time of the tablet; Lactose as diluents; sodium lauryl sulphate as foaming agent and starch as disintegrant. Three formulations (F 1, F 2, and F 3) were prepared by varying concentration of starch. Tablets were evaluated for hardness, disintegration time, friability, dissolution profile and effect on pH value of medium. F 1 shows maximum disintegration time approximately 20 minutes, F 2 and F 3 shows 15 minutes and 11 minutes respectively. Dissolution profile of F 1 shows 74. 48 % release, F 2 and F 3 shows 78. 89 % and 99. 94 % release within 8 minutes respectively, thus F 3 formulation shows nearly complete release within 8 minutes and lower disintegration time.

Vaginally administered local estrogen therapy (LET) is the standard of care for symptoms of vaginal atrophy that {{do not respond to}} nonhormonal interventions. Several LET formulations are available, and choice of therapy is based largely on patient needs and preferences. This online survey of postmenopausal LET users was conducted to investigate reasons for switching to <b>vaginal</b> estradiol <b>tablets</b> from other formulations and to evaluate factors associated with patient preference for and compliance with use of LET. Data was analyzed from 73 respondents currently using estradiol <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> who have previously used the estradiol vaginal ring, estradiol vaginal cream, and/or conjugated estrogen vaginal cream. Patients in this survey rated vaginal symptoms of vaginal atrophy as being more bothersome than urinary symptoms. Respondents preferred their current treatment with the <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> to their previous treatment with a cream or ring. The preference for tablets over creams was mainly related to formulation and application rather than to any perceived safety issues. Tablets were perceived as efficacious, convenient, and neat to apply. The study participants also reported a longer duration of tablet use compared with creams or rings, and greater compliance with <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> than with <b>vaginal</b> cream.

40|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative to}} gels as an inexpensive, discreet dosage form for the administration of microbicides. This work describes the pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of rapidly disintegrating <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> containing tenofovir (TFV, 10 mg), emtricitabine (FTC, 10 mg), and the combination of TFV and FTC (10 mg each) under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and in direct comparison to the clinical TFV 1 % gel, a microbicide product in Phase III clinical testing. The PK of TFV and FTC from tablets were also evaluated in female rabbits following intravaginal administration. Direct comparison of a single dose of TFV tablets (intact or predissolved at 10 mg/mL) and TFV 1 % gel showed no differences in the vaginal PK of TFV between groups; however systemic bioavailability of TFV was significantly higher from the gel. When rabbits were dosed either once or daily for seven days with intact tablets of TFV, FTC, or the combination of TFV/FTC, vaginal and systemic concentrations of TFV and FTC were unaffected by co-formulation. Moreover, plasma PK parameters were similar following a single dose or seven once-daily doses. Tissue concentrations of TFV and FTC in the cranial vagina 4 h after administration ranged between 104 and 105 ng/g. Concentrations of TFV-diphospate (TFV-DP, the active metabolite) were also high (over 103 ng/g or about 3000 to 6000 fmol/mg) in the cranial vagina 4 h after administration and similar to those measured following administration of TFV 1 % gel. These data demonstrate that rapidly disintegrating <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> may be a suitable topical microbicide dosage form providing similar vaginal TFV PK to that of TFV 1 % gel.

Sixty-seven patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV), 50 with intermediate flora and 42 with normal vaginal flora were enrolled in this double-blind study. The subjects were randomized to receive probiotic lactobacilli <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> (L. brevis CD 2, L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, L. plantarum) or the <b>vaginal</b> pH <b>tablet</b> (active comparator). Cervico-vaginal lavage was collected to measure the concentrations of IL- 1 β, TNFα and IL- 6 by ELISA. Neutral sphingomyelinase activity was also quantified in both arms before and after treatment. The probiotic <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> was well tolerated and no side effects were reported. The study demonstrated a cure rate of nearly 80 %; i. e., 32 % of the women could restore normal vaginal flora and 47 % had improved Nugent score, whereas 20 % of the subjects did not clear BV in the first follow-up (after 8 days treatment). The pH tablet containing pH lowering compounds induced resolution of BV and restoration of normal vaginal flora in 74 % and 26 %, respectively. The lactobacilli tablet was found to be better than the pH tablet in preventing BV in healthy subjects. A significant reduction in IL- 1 β and IL- 6 vaginal cytokines was observed after treatment with lactobacilli, while the active comparator did not have any effect on local proinflammatory cytokines.

Patients and methods: This questionnaire-based audit included responses from 100 patients undergoing IVF treatment at six IVF clinics in the UK from September 2015 to November 2016. Fourteen days after starting progesterone supplementation for LPS during their IVF treatment, patients rated overall experience and perceived convenience of the prescribed progesterone by completing a questionnaire. Results: Of the 100 patients included, 96 received <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>tablets</b> for LPS. Overall, 53. 1 % (51 / 96) indicated that the progesterone tablets were “very easy” to use; 42. 7 % (41 / 96) and 44. 8 % (43 / 96) found it “very convenient” or “neither convenient or inconvenient” to administer the tablet, respectively. Overall experience with using progesterone tablets was rated as “very comfortable” by 34. 4 % (33 / 96) and “neither comfortable or uncomfortable” by 56. 3 % (54 / 96) of patients. The applicator was used by 93. 8 % (90 / 96) of patients to administer the tablet, and 86. 5 % (83 / 96) indicated that the applicator was easy to clean for repeated use. A total of 33 patients had a previous IVF cycle during which they were prescribed vaginal progesterone pessaries for LPS. Compared with progesterone pessaries, the majority found treatment with progesterone tablets to be more comfortable (60. 6 %; 20 / 33) and more convenient (57. 6 %; 19 / 33) and indicated that the progesterone tablet was their preferred progesterone formulation for LPS (60. 6 %; 20 / 33).

The method {{was performed in}} the isocratic mode on a RP- 18 column (30 °C) using a mobile phase consisting of ammonium acetate 0. 05 M buffer / Methanol mixture (30 : 70) and a flow-rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, LOD and LOQ of the method were validated. The method was linear over the range of 5 – 500 µg/mL with an acceptable correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0. 9996). The method’s limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0. 01 and 0. 025 µg/mL respectively. The results indicate that this validated method {{can be used as}} an alternative method for assay of nystatin...|$|R
40|$|Mary Jane Minkin, 1 Ricardo Maamari, 2 Suzanne Reiter 3 1 Department of Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA; 2 Novo Nordisk Inc., Plainsboro, NJ, USA; 3 Mid-County Health Center, Largo, FL, USA Abstract: Postmenopausal vaginal atrophy, {{resulting}} from decreased estrogen production, frequently requires treatment. Estrogen preparations {{provide the most}} effective treatment; local application is preferred to systemic drugs when treating only vaginal symptoms. As local estrogen therapies have comparable efficacy, this study aimed to understand treatment practices, assess experiences with different forms of local estrogen-delivering applicators, and evaluate satisfaction. Women who were US residents aged ≥ 18 years, menopausal (no spontaneous menstrual period for ≥ 1 year or with a double oophorectomy), and receiving local estrogen therapy for 1 – 6 months (vaginal cream [supplied with a reusable applicator] or <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> [supplied with a single-use/disposable applicator]), completed an online questionnaire. Data from 200 women (100 cream users and 100 tablet users; mean therapy duration 3. 48 months) showed that most stored medication in the room {{in which it was}} applied (88 %) and applied it at bedtime (71 %), a procedure for which cream users required, on average, more than twice the time of tablet users (5. 08 minutes versus 2. 48 minutes). Many cream users applied larger-than-prescribed amounts of cream, attempting to achieve greater efficacy (42 %), or lower-than-recommended doses (45 %), most frequently to avoid messiness (33 %) or leakage (30 %). More tablet users (69 %) than cream users (14 %) were "extremely satisfied" with their applicator. Postmenopausal women using local estrogen therapy were generally more satisfied with the application of <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> than cream. Patient satisfaction may help to facilitate accurate dosing. Positive perceptions of medication will help to optimize treatment, which, although not assessed in this study, is likely, in turn, to improve vaginal health.

40|$|Objective  To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of prostaglandin E 2 (dinoprostone) vaginal gel for the induction of labour at term {{from the perspective}} of the UK’s National Health Service. Design  Economic evaluation conducted as part of a randomised controlled trial. Setting  Maternity department at a major teaching hospital in London, UK. Population  A cohort of 165 pregnant women presenting as cephalic between 36 + 6 and 41 + 6 weeks of gestation, for whom induction of labour was deemed necessary. Methods  Either 3 -mg Prostin E 2 <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> or 1 - or 2 -mg Prostin E 2 vaginal gel were administered at 6 -hourly intervals. Main outcome measures  Incremental cost per hour prevented between induction and delivery. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and estimate net benefits at alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds. Results  Women receiving the gel accrued nonsignificantly higher costs (incremental cost £ 630; bootstrap 95...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -day {{treatment}} with tioconazole <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> (Gyno-Trosid; Pfizer) {{was used in}} 30 patients with vaginal candidosis during a prospective, mycologically controlled study. Candida yeasts were identified by microscopy and culture before initiation of treatment and then on days 3, 6 and 28. On the 6 th day, all patients had responded to the treatment {{and there was a}} 100 % cure rate on microscopic and mycological examination. After 4 weeks, 83 % of the patients still had relief of symptoms, although a recurrence of Candida on culture and microscopy was detected in 14 patients (46 %). Seven of these were available for further assessment and, when given a second course of treatment, they were cured both clinically and microbiologically. There was no evidence of any adverse systemic reaction and local side effects were limited to a transient sensation of mild to moderate burning. Problems relating to recurrence of symptoms and reappearance of Candida are discussed. Articl...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{patients}} were equally randomized {{to receive a}} single dose of 6. 5 % tioconazole ointment or a 3 -day course of 100 -mg clotrimazole <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> {{for the treatment of}} vulvovaginal candidiasis. Of the 32 evaluable patients treated with tioconazole, 27 (84 %) remained asymptomatic 4 weeks posttreatment, compared with 28 of 33 patients (85 %) treated with clotrimazole. A total of 34 patients in each group could be evaluated for mycological response based on culture results 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. Twenty patients (59 %) who received tioconazole and twenty-one patients (62 %) who received clotrimazole remained culture negative 4 weeks after therapy. Of 40 patients who received tioconazole, 12 (30 %) experienced local irritation or itching, compared with 2 of 40 patients (5 %) treated with clotrimazole (P less than 0. 01). Single-dose tioconazole ointment was as effective as a 3 -day course of clotrimazole tablets, but significantly more patients in the tioconazole-treated group experienced local side effects...|$|R
40|$|Metronidazole was {{formulated}} in mucoadhesive <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> by directly compressing the natural cationic polymer chitosan, loosely cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, together with sodium alginate with or ine cellulose (MCC). Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) {{was added to}} some of the formulations. The drug content in tablets was 20 %. Drug dissolution rate studies from tablets were carried out in buffer pH 4. 8 and distilled water. Swelling indices and adhesion forces were also measured for all formulations. The formula (FIII) containing 6 % chitosan, 24 % sodium alginate, 30 % sodium CMC, and 20 % MCC showed adequate release properties in both media and gave lower values of swelling index compared with the other examined formulations. FIII also proved to have good adhesion properties with minimum applied weights. Moreover, its release properties (% dissolution efficiency, DE) in buffer pH 4. 8, as well as release mechanism (n values), were negligibly affected by aging. Thus, this formula may be considered a good candidate for vaginal mucoadhesive dosage forms...|$|R
