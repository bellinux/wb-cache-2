5|$|In response, Kraft Foods filed a trademark-infringement {{lawsuit in}} February 2013. Kraft has sold cheese in retail stores under their Cracker Barrel brand since 1954.

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

25|$|The work {{of these}} prewar {{nationalist}} historians has shaped postwar historiography in both North and South Korea.

25|$|Pelosi {{represents}} one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won the seat in her own right in 1988 and has been reelected 10 more times with no substantive opposition, winning by an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross. The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.|$|E
25|$|The Canberra Knights, {{along with}} the Sydney Bears and Adelaide Avalanche, founded the AIHL as a three-team {{competition}} following the disbanding of the ECSL in 2000. 2002 saw {{the introduction of the}} Melbourne Ice, the Newcastle Northstars and the West Sydney Ice Dogs, increasing the number of teams in the league to 6. The team finished just above the Melbourne Ice in fifth place, ending the season with 12 points and a fourth placed goaltender, Brad Hunt. In 2003 David Lewis, and import Saku Martakainen were both top scorers, but the Knights did not perform very well, ending the season in last place, not winning a single game. Since a playoff format was introduced to the AIHL in 2003 (prior to this, minor premiers were champions), the Knights <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> the postseason.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{investment}} in public transport {{in the late}} 1980s turned to light rail {{as an alternative to}} more costly underground railway solutions, {{with the opening of the}} Tyne and Wear Metro (1980) and the Docklands Light Railway in London (1987) systems. However, the first British city to reintroduce on-street trams was Manchester, with the opening of its Metrolink network in 1992. Several other UK cities followed with their own modern tram systems, including Sheffield (Supertram, opened 1994), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (Midland Metro, opened 1999), London (London Tramlink, opened 2000) and Nottingham (Nottingham Express Transit, opened 2004). Many of these tram cities are planning or building network extensions (construction is in progress in Manchester, Nottingham and Birmingham/Wolverhampton) and several more tram systems are being proposed or are under construction, such as Edinburgh Trams, Belfast EWAY (proposed) and Liverpool Merseytram (proposed). Other tramway projects <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> it beyond the proposal stage because of funding problems, for example London's Cross River Tram and the Leeds Supertram, which is now to be a trolleybus system.|$|E

25|$|The band holds tryouts usually {{two weeks}} before school starts. This is {{somewhat}} variable as the band staff tries to allow for members to perform in Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis. In recent years, DCI Finals night was held on a Saturday night, while OSUMB Candidate Days (for all prospective band members who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> the band before) would begin the following Sunday morning. Due to a tighter schedule in 2016, Candidate Days were held during DCI Finals, and full band tryouts began the following morning. Typically this is avoided however, to allow incoming freshmen to finish a drum corps tour and then learn the OSU style in the two days prior to full band tryouts. Once the band is picked and until school starts up, the band practices {{three times a day}} Monday through Friday. Once school starts, the band rehearses Monday-Friday from 4:10-6:15 PM. However, the Band Center doors are typically not locked until midnight, as many band members will do other classwork while practicing and memorizing their music for the week's show. Many shows must be learned in as little as four days, with all music and drill committed to memory.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its large}} size, Nashville {{has been in}} a single congressional {{district}} for most of the time since Reconstruction; it is currently the 5th District, represented by Democrat Jim Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's American Independent Party kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House for much of Franklin Roosevelt's first term as President. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill Boner also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.|$|E
25|$|The flanker's role is {{to tackle}} the {{opposition}} and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker binds {{to the side of}} the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the blindside covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely {{to the side of the}} scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line-out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition's attacking plays. During open play if they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line-out. The openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside, with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to 'charge' the opposition fly-half, putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision making, kicking or passing. Blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth-man to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum.|$|E
