5|$|COBOL syntax <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{criticized for}} its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this}} was {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance.

5|$|Several key {{employees}} left Rare to {{form their}} own companies, such as Free Radical Design and Playtonic Games.

5000|$|New passives <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{developed}} by co-opting the original reflexive formations in CA, particularly verb forms V, VI and VII (In CA these were derivational, not inflectional, as neither their existence nor exact meaning could be depended upon; however, they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{incorporated into the}} inflectional system, especially in more innovative sedentary dialects).|$|R

5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work.

5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted.

5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{credited}} with gaining {{the right to}} vote for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women {{the right to vote}} was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Carrick has {{represented}} England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 {{and has since}} gained 34 caps but is yet to score an international goal. Carrick <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Gareth Barry and (for a brief time) Scott Parker preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick {{established himself as a}} regular. He {{has been a member of}} the England squads for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the 85-minute {{version was}} the only one available, but despite this its {{reputation}} slowly grew. In 1956, boxes of original material were rediscovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival, with only a minor scene from Renoir's first cut missing. Since then, The Rules of the Game <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Numerous film critics and directors have praised it highly, citing it as an inspiration for their own work.|$|E
5|$|Further east, off the Whitby Road, is the Monks' Pond, the canons' fish pond.

In 1908, the pond {{was the scene of}} an elaborate water tableau organised by Lady Gisborough to raise funds for the restoration of St Nicholas' Church. The pond was home to a number of exceptionally large fish, but pollution in 2000 caused by a sewage leak led to the death of more than 5,000 fish.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{the role}} of French rugby coach (or trainer) has varied considerably.

Therefore, a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible.|$|E
5|$|I Want You is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E
