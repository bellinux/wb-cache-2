40|$|Within antero-medial {{gonarthrosis}} (AMG) of the knee, {{there is}} a spectrum of damage seen in the <b>functionally</b> <b>intact</b> anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Our aim was to correlate the degree of ACL damage to the geographical extent and degree of cartilage loss on the tibial plateau. Ninety tibial plateaus resected during unicompartmental arthroplasty were photographed and digitally mapped. The ACL damage was graded (0 : normal, 1 : synovium loss, 2 : longitudinal splits), and dimensions of full thickness cartilage loss and damage recorded. The percentage of full thickness loss in patients with a normal ACL was compared to those with a damaged, but <b>functionally</b> <b>intact</b> ligament. All specimens showed similar elliptical loss of cartilage in the antero-medial part of the tibial plateau. A total of 45 (50 %) patients had a macroscopically normal ACL, 21 (23 %) had synovial loss, and 24 (27 %) had longitudinal splits. An increase {{in the area of}} cartilage damage was seen with progressive ACL damage (p < 0. 001). The area of macroscopically normal cartilage found posteriorly did not change. This study demonstrates that phenotypic distribution of cartilage damage in AMG is highly reproducible with a pattern of increasing cartilage erosion associated with increasing ACL damage. © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are <b>functionally</b> <b>intact</b> in psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls.

The peculiarity of this isolation technique is the maintenance of strictly physiological values of pH and osmolality throughout the entire procedure. Moreover, the cells are not subjected to measures aimed at changing the physical properties of either neutrophils or eosinophils. Because of such charac-teristics, this isolation method could be usefully exploited for comparative studies of normal and eosinophilic nor-modense eosinophils and of neutrophils and eosinophils from the same noneosinophilic subject.

40|$|In retinal rods light {{triggers}} {{a cascade of}} enzymatic reactions that increases cGMP hydrolysis and generates an electrical signal by causing closure of cGMP-gated ion channels in the photoreceptor outer segment. This leads to a decrease in internal Ca, which activates guanylate cyclase and promotes photoresponse recovery by stimulating the resynthesis of cGMP. We report here that the activation of guanylate cyclase by low Ca is mediated by an approximately 20 -kDa protein purified from bovine rod outer segments by using DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and reverse-phase chromatographies.
