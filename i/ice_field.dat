The discussions on the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute were temporarily given a lower priority, and the focus shifted to discussions of fishing rights. He also settled all remaining border issues with Chile. The Lago del Desierto dispute had an international arbitration, favourable to Argentina. The only exception was the dispute over the Southern Patagonian <b>Ice</b> <b>Field,</b> which is still open.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial <b>ice</b> <b>field.</b> Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{has a number}} of athletic facilities open to the varsity teams and to the other students. The stadium with the largest seating capacity at the university is Warrior Field. The field is home to the varsity field hockey and football teams, and hosts the university's recreational flag football and soccer activities. It has a seating capacity of 5,400. Other facilities include the Physical Activity Complex, which houses two gymnasiums, beach volleyball courts, squash rooms, and a swimming pool, and is also home to the university's varsity badminton, basketball, squash, swimming and volleyball teams. The Columbia <b>Ice</b> <b>Field</b> was constructed in 1983 and houses the university's hockey team home rink, with a seating capacity of 700. The <b>Ice</b> <b>Field</b> has been expanded twice, in 1990 and 2003, and now includes three gyms and a number of fitness centres. Including the football field, the university manages seven outdoor playing fields, with Fields 1 and 2 reserved for the varsity soccer and rugby teams. The rest of the fields are used by the university's recreational sports programs.|$|E

Graded at AD+ to D-, dependent upon conditions, the route has an average angle of around 52° and the summit takes around 4 hours or more to reach from the Torino Hut. The route's difficulties are being mainly in overcoming the initial bergschrund and the moving from the lower to the upper <b>ice</b> <b>field.</b> By keeping to the right hand side of the slope climbers are able to utilise rock belays {{for much of the}} climb. Dangers involve rock and ice fall, and an early start is necessary to ensure good snow conditions as the face does get exposed to the sun later in the day.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 14 April, in the {{wireless}} room on the boat deck, Phillips was sending messages to Cape Race, Newfoundland, working to clear a backlog of passengers' personal messages that had accumulated when the wireless had broken down the day before. Bride was asleep in the adjoining cabin, intending to relieve Phillips at midnight, two hours early. Shortly after 9:30 pm, Phillips received an ice warning from the steamship Mesaba reporting {{a large number of}} icebergs and an <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> directly in Titanics path. Phillips acknowledged the Mesabas warning and continued to transmit messages to Cape Race. The Mesabas wireless operator waited for Phillips to report that he had given the report to the bridge, but Phillips continued working Cape Race. The message {{was one of the most}} important warnings Titanic received, but it was never delivered to the bridge.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1889, two steamships {{were spotted}} {{approaching}} the lighthouse of Russarö {{from the south}} and news about unidentified vessels coming through the <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker Bryderen and a 912-ton cargo steamer Vesuv, owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken — a foreign icebreaker had come through the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port. The successful arrival of Bryderen was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.|$|E

500|$|A large {{region of}} {{population}} surrounding {{the central and}} southern Andes of Argentina and Chile reside in arid areas that are dependent on water supplies from melting glaciers. The water from the glaciers also supplies rivers that have in some cases been dammed for hydroelectric power. Some researchers believe that by 2030, many of the large ice caps on the highest Andes will be gone if current climate trends continue. In Patagonia on {{the southern tip of}} the continent, the large ice caps have retreated a [...] since the early 1990s and [...] since the late 19th century. It has also been observed that Patagonian glaciers are receding at a faster rate than in any other world region. The Northern Patagonian <b>Ice</b> <b>Field</b> lost [...] of glacier area during the years between 1945 and 1975, and [...] from 1975 to 1996, which indicates that the rate of retreat is increasing. This represents a loss of 8% of the <b>ice</b> <b>field,</b> with all glaciers experiencing significant retreat. The Southern Patagonian <b>Ice</b> <b>Field</b> has exhibited a general trend of retreat on 42 glaciers, while four glaciers were in equilibrium and two advanced during the years between 1944 and 1986.

[...] In the Aconcagua River Basin, glacier retreat has resulted in a 20% loss in glacier area, declining from [...] to [...] The Marinelli Glacier in Tierra del Fuego has been in retreat since at least 1960 through 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{prevailing}} {{public reaction}} to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against {{a number of issues}} and people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his own life when so many others died? Why did Titanic proceed into the <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> at full speed? The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard Carpathia on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to [...] "awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future" [...] and wrote a public letter to The Times urging changes to maritime safety laws.|$|E

The tighter schedule, with only eight weeks of pre-production and 45 days of principal photography, still caused the production to have less location shooting than planned. Los Angeles ended up standing in for Dallas and London (though a shot was done in London with a double), and the ice scenes, initially envisaged for an <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> in Alaska, were moved to Whistler, British Columbia, nearby the show's regular locations in Vancouver.

[...] This message, too, {{never left the}} Titanics radio room. The radio operator, Jack Phillips, may have failed to grasp its significance because he was preoccupied with transmitting messages for passengers via the relay station at Cape Race, Newfoundland; the radio set had broken down the day before, resulting in a backlog of messages that the two operators were trying to clear. A final warning was received at 22:30 from operator Cyril Evans of Californian, which had halted for the night in an <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> some miles away, but Phillips cut it off and signalled back: [...] "Shut up!
