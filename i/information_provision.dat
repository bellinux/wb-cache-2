QAA was under contract to the Higher Education Funding Council for England to assess quality for English universities. This replaced Teaching Quality Assessments (TQAs) which aimed to assess the administrative, policy and procedural framework within which teaching took place and did not directly assess teaching quality. This inspection-based system {{was replaced by a}} system of <b>information</b> <b>provision,</b> including a national student survey. QAA publishes scores which have been used by the league table industry. The first Teaching Excellence Framework is to be published in 2017; this is a rating system (giving gold, silver or bronze ratings to higher education providers) rather than a ranking as such.|$|E

40|$|Farm {{animal welfare}} in {{livestock}} production is a topical and important issue attracting growing interest of policy makers, consumers, stakeholders {{in the supply}} chain and others. While there is much public interest in the issue this is not reflected in the supply and market shares of animal food products that are produced under welfare standards that exceed legislative requirements. Given the obstacles to devising stricter legislative standards, higher welfare animal food products are mostly made available through market-based approaches. This paper discusses different challenges and opportunities {{for a range of}} public and consumer policies and makes recommendations on how these might be strengthened. The paper does not report primary empirical findings but assembles available knowledge on citizen and consumer attitudes and perceptions towards animal welfare from various research disciplines. We argue that in order for public and consumer policies to be (more) efficient and effective, it is important to develop a segmented and targeted strategy. This paper will thus elaborate on what information could and should be provided to whom. This implies the need for a good understanding of how people conceptualize farm animal welfare. Further, <b>information</b> <b>provisioning</b> should address the needs and expectations of those specific consumer segments most likely to be motivated to purchase higher welfare products. Based on the assembled information, opportunities and challenges for <b>information</b> <b>provisioning</b> and communication to the public and consumers are identified. The merits and limitations of different forms of <b>information</b> <b>provisioning</b> and animal welfare labelling are discussed and recommendations are set forth for future research...|$|R

The proposed system {{has the potential of}} making location-service solutions more open, simple and secure, thus leading to greater user acceptance and prospects for LBS market growth in future. ...|$|R
