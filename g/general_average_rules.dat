40|$|For the {{practical}} {{estimation of the}} error of Gauss quadrature rules Gauss-Kronrod rules are widely used; but, {{it is well known}} that for the generalized Hermite weight function, ωα(x) = |x| 2 α exp(−x 2) over [−∞,∞], real positive Gauss-Kronrod rules do not exist. Among the alternatives which are available in the literature, the anti-Gauss and <b>average</b> <b>rules</b> introduced by Laurie, and their modified versions, are of particular interest. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the modified anti-Gauss and <b>average</b> quadrature <b>rules</b> for ωα, and we determine the degree optimal <b>average</b> <b>rules</b> by proving that for each n-point Gauss rule for ωα there exists a unique <b>average</b> <b>rule</b> with the precise degree of exactness 2 n+ 3. We also give some numerical examples to test the performance of the <b>average</b> <b>rules</b> obtained in this paper...|$|R

It is shown that the selection of stocks through the analyst consensus recommendations with periodical rebalancing is profitable and performs better than the buy-andhold benchmark. Furthermore, the application of Moving <b>Average</b> <b>Rules</b> displays potential to improve the risk adjusted performance of the basket of selected stocks, with a Sharpe ratio of 0. 77. It is also shown that the Moving <b>Average</b> <b>Rules</b> outperform the benchmark in bearish periods, with poorer results being reached during bullish periods. All the results are computed in a real-life setting accounting transaction costs inferred from the market.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a general class of nonlinear subdivision algorithms for functions {{of a real}} or complex variable built from linear subdivision algorithms by replacing binary linear averages such as the arithmetic mean by binary nonlinear averages such as the geometric mean. Using our method, we can easily create stationary subdivision schemes for Gaussian functions, spiral curves, and circles with uniform parametrizations. More generally, we show that stationary subdivision schemes for e p(x), cos(p(x)) and sin(p(x)) for any polynomial or piecewise polynomial p(x) can be generated using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and square roots. The smoothness of our nonlinear subdivision schemes is inherited from the smoothness of the original linear subdivision schemes and the differentiability of the corresponding nonlinear <b>averaging</b> <b>rules.</b> While our results are quite general, our proofs are elementary, based mainly on the observation that generic nonlinear <b>averaging</b> <b>rules</b> {{on a pair of}} real or complex numbers can be constructed by conjugating linear <b>averaging</b> <b>rules</b> with locally invertible nonlinear maps. In a forthcoming paper we show that every continuous nonlinear <b>averaging</b> <b>rule</b> on a pair of real or complex numbers can be constructed by conjugating a linear <b>averaging</b> <b>rule</b> with an associated continuous locally invertible nonlinear map. Thus the <b>averaging</b> <b>rules</b> considered in this paper are actually the general case. As an application we show how to apply our nonlinear subdivision algorithms to intersect some common transcendental functions. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{attempts}} to develop strategies that enable portfolio managers to improve market timing by learning to recognize leading indications of forthcoming changes. The {{aim of this}} study is the testing, in a Mutual Fund series, of the predicting ability of a popular technical exchange tool, the Moving <b>Average</b> <b>Rule.</b> A short-term and a long-term moving average are used for the creation of “buy ” and “sell ” signals of mutual funds. 2891 predictions were made, for the same time-series, for different values of short-term and long-term moving averages and the profitability of this method was calculated. The method was proved profitable, if no buy and sell cost was counted. The Two Moving <b>Average</b> <b>Rule</b> by itself is efficient only for the companies that administrate the respective mutual fund and not for the single investor. It is presented the triple moving <b>average</b> <b>rule,</b> which possibly can be a solution for this problem...|$|R

The {{decision maker}} can design {{a finite number of}} experiments in which treatments are tested. For the case of two treatments we present a rule for designing experiments and making a recommendation that attains minimax regret and can thus ensure a given maximal error with the minimal number of tests. 11 tests are needed under the so-called binomial <b>average</b> <b>rule</b> to limit the error to 5 %. We also consider the setting where there is covariate information to then identify minimax regret behavior and drastically reduce the number of tests needed to attain a given maximal error as compared to the literature (over 200 to 22 given two covariates). We extend the binomial <b>average</b> <b>rule</b> to more than two treatments and use it to derive a bound on minimax regret. statistical decision making, treatment response <b>rule,</b> binomial <b>average</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{momentum}} trading strategy {{based on the}} low frequency trend component of the spot exchange rate. Using kernel regression and the high-pass filter of Hodrick and Prescott [Hodrick, R., Prescott, E., 1997. Post-war US business cycles: An empirical investigation. Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 29, 1 - 16], we recover the non-linear trend in the monthly exchange rate and use short-term momentum in this to generate buy and sell signals. The low frequency momentum trading strategy offers greater directional accuracy, higher returns and Sharpe ratios, lower maximum drawdown and less frequent trading than traditional moving <b>average</b> <b>rules.</b> Moreover, unlike traditional moving <b>average</b> <b>rules,</b> {{the performance of the}} low frequency momentum trading strategy is relatively robust across different time periods. The low frequency momentum trading strategy is also robust to the choice of smoothing parameter (in the case of the HP filter) and the distribution and bandwidth parameter (in the case of kernel regression) over a wide range of values.
