50|$|As {{a result}} of this step in band edges, a {{depletion}} region near the junction becomes depleted of both holes and electrons, forming an insulating region with almost no mobile charges. There are, however, fixed, immobile charges due to dopant ions. The near absence of mobile charge in the depletion layer means that the mobile charges present are insufficient to balance the immobile charge contributed by the dopant ions: a negative charge on the p-type side due to acceptor dopant and as a positive charge on the n-type side due to donor dopant. Because of this charge there is an electric field in this region, as determined by Poisson's equation. The width of the depletion region adjusts so the negative acceptor charge on the p-side exactly balances the positive <b>donor</b> <b>charge</b> on the n-side, so there is no electric field outside the depletion region on either side.|$|E

The contribution (b) into the strain-voltage SPM was not calculated previously, while the contribution (c) was not even predicted before, while our estimations performed for correlated oxides show that strength of (c) appeared comparable with (a,b). For the case of ion-blocking tip and substrate electrode mainly the changes in holes (electrons) concentration contribute into the voltage-dependent mechanical displacement of the film surface, directly registered by strain SPM.

In low dimensional systems the role of symmetry is enhanced and can give rise to new phenomena. Here, we report on unexpected magnetism in carbon nanotubes and O-rich surfaces of ionic oxides, to show how its existence {{is closely related to}} the symmetry conditions. First, based on tight-binding models, we demonstrate that chiral carbon nanotubes present spin splitting at the Fermi level {{in the absence of a}} magnetic field, whereas achiral tubes preserve spin degeneracy. These remarkably different behaviors of chiral and non-chiral nanotubes are due to the intrinsic symmetry dependence of the spin-orbit interaction. Second, the occurence of spin-polarization at ZrO_(2), Al_(2) O_(3) and MgO surfaces is proved by means of abinitio calculations within the density functional theory. Large spin moments develop at O-ended polar terminations, transforming the non-magnetic insulator into a half-metal.

To be suitable for road transport applications, safe and compact hydrogen storage systems need to be developed, the primary technological motivation for this PhD project which investigates hydrogen absorbed into graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), to gain a fundamental physical understanding of the sorption processes to improve such materials' capacity for hydrogen storage. Literature searching has led to a principal investigation, primarily using neutron scattering and thermogravimetry, of potassium and calcium-GICs with hydrogen. Inelastic neutron scattering on hydrogenated KC 24 has shown hydrogen sorption in this system to be quantitatively different from its analogues RbC 24 and CsC 24.

The system considered consists of donor charges taken to be uniformly distributed within an inner core of infinitely long length. The core is concentrically enveloped by a semiconducting material of finite thickness; which is essentially the host material. This configuration of the donor charges sets up a spatially varying electric field nonetheless with only the radial component. In addition, a uniform magnetic field is applied parallel to the axis of symmetry of the inner core. As is well known, the axial applied magnetic field lifts the double degeneracies of the electron’s subbands characterized by the same azimuthal quantum numbers which differ only in sign. The main effect of increasing the external electric field is to elevate the various energy subbands, more or less to the same extent, to higher values. Further, evaluations of the oscillator strengths of optical transitions of the {{cylindrical shell}} are carried out within the dipole approximation. The radiation field is taken {{to be that of}} circularly polarized light incident along the axis of the core.

Despite the high primary sequence analogies of the QA and QB protein pockets between R. gelatinosus and the much more studied species as Rps. viridis, Rb. sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus, the energetic behaviour of the quinone complex of R. gelatinosus appears to be somewhat different: (i) above pH 10, kAP decreases, whereas it increases in Rps. uiridis; this suggests {{the presence of a}} protonatable group that stabilizes I− (I is a bacteriopheophytin electron acceptor) rather than QA−; (ii) the pH dependence of kBP is unusually flat in the range 4 – 7. 5, possibly reflecting that a substantial part of the P+QB− charge recombination proceeds via the direct route through the protein by an electron tunnelling mechanism, at variance to what is observed in the three species mentioned above; (iii) the very substantial increase of kBP observed above pH 7. 5 is reasonably well described by the presence of two apparent protonatable groups: pK 1 QB = 9. 4, pK 2 QB−= 11 and pK 2 QB = 8. 5, pK 2 QB−= 9. 4. The latter group was not reported in Rps. viridis, Rb. sphaeroides or Rb. capsulatus.

Several countries have investigated by experiments and numerical simulations the effect of confinement on the go/no go threshold for Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) pellets having a height and diameter of 3 mm, confined by a steel annulus of wall thickness 1 - 3. 5 mm. Confinement of the PETN by a steel annulus of the same height of the pellet with 1 -mm wall thickness makes the component more sensitive (larger gap). As the wall thickness is increased to 2 -mm, the gap increases a lesser amount, but when the wall thickness is increased to 3. 5 -mm a decrease in sensitivity is observed (smaller gap). This decrease of the water gap has been reproduced experimentally. Recent numerical simulations using Ignition and Growth model [1] for the PETN Pellet have reproduced the experimental results for the steel confinement up to 2 mm thick [2]. The presence of a stronger re-shock following the first input shock from the water and focusing on the axis {{have been identified in}} the pellet due to the steel confinement.

40|$|Spin {{properties}} of donor impurities in silicon {{have been investigated}} by electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques for more than sixty years. These studies gave us a contribution towards understanding some of the physics of doped semiconductor materials in general, which is the platform for much of our current technology. Despite the fact that donor electron and nuclear spins have been researched for so long, ESR studies of their properties are still giving us interesting insights. With {{the introduction of the}} concept of quantum information in the 1980 s, some {{properties of}} donor spins in silicon, that were known from the fifties (such as long relaxations), have been reinterpreted for their potential application in this field. Since then, incredible experimental results have been achieved with magnetic resonance control, including manipulation and read-out of individual spins. However, some open questions are still to be answered before the realisation of a spin-based silicon quantum architecture will be achieved. Currently, ESR studies still contribute to help answering some of those questions. In this thesis, we demonstrate electrical and optical methods for <b>donor</b> <b>charge</b> state manipulation measured by ESR. Recent experiments have demonstrated that coherence time of nuclear spins may be enhanced by manipulating the state of donors from neutral to singly charged. We investigate electric field ionisation/neutralisation of arsenic donors in a silicon SOI device measured by ESR. Below ionisation threshold, we also measure the hyperfine Stark shift of arsenic donors spins in silicon. These results have, for instance, implications on how fast individual addressability of donor spins may be achieved in certain quantum computer architectures. Here, we also study optical-driven charge state manipulation of selenium impurities in silicon. Selenium has two additional electrons when it replaces an atom in the silicon crystal (i. e. double donor). The electronic properties of singly-ionised selenium make it potentially advantageous as spin qubit, compared to the more commonly studied group-V donors. For instance, we find here that the electron spin relaxation and coherence times of selenium are up to two orders of magnitude longer than phosphorus at the same temperature. Finally, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} bring selenium impurity in singly-charged state and subsequently re-neutralise them leaving a potential long-lived 77 Se nuclear spin.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{combustion}} {{of the new}} solid nitrate ester 2, 3 -hydroxymethyl- 2, 3 -dinitro- 1, 4 -butanediol tetranitrate (SMX, C 6 H 8 N 6 O 16). SMX was synthesized {{for the first time}} in 2008. It has a melting point of 85 °C and oxygen balance of 0 % to CO 2, allowing it to be used as an energetic additive or oxidizer in solid propellants. In addition to its neat combustion characteristics, this work also explores the use of SMX as a potential replacement for nitroglycerin (NG) in double base gun propellants and as a replacement for ammonium perchlorate in composite rocket propellants. ^ The physical properties, sensitivity characteristics, and combustion behaviors of neat SMX were investigated. Its combustion is stable at pressures of up to at least 27. 5 MPa (n = 0. 81). The observed flame structure is nearly identical to that of other double base propellant ingredients, with a primary flame attached at the surface, a thick isothermal dark zone, and a luminous secondary flame wherein final recombination reactions occur. As a result, the burning rate and primary flame structure can be modeled using existing one-dimensional steady state techniques. A zero gas-phase activation energy approximation results in a good fit between modeled and observed behavior. ^ Additionally, SMX was considered as a replacement for nitroglycerin in a double base propellant. Thermochemical calculations indicate improved performance when compared with the common double base propellant JA 2 at SMX loadings above 40 wt-%. Also, since SMX is a room temperature solid, migration may be avoided. Like other nitrate esters, SMX is susceptible to decomposition over long-term storage due to the presence of excess acid in the crystals; the addition of stabilizers (e. g., derivatives of urea) during synthesis should be sufficient to prevent this. the addition of Both unplasticized and plasticized propellants were formulated. Thermal analysis of unplasticized propellant showed a distinct melt-recrystallization curve, which indicates that a solid phase solution is being formed between SMX and NC, and that SMX would not act as plasticizer. Analysis of propellant prepared with diethyleneglycol dinitrate (DEGDN) plasticizer indicates that the SMX is likely dissolved in the DEGDN. The plasticized material also showed similar hardness and modulus to JA 2. However, both plasticized and unplasticized propellants exhibited deconsolidated burning at elevated pressures due to the high modulus of the propellant. Increased amounts of plasticizer or improved processing of the nitrocellulose should be investigated to remedy this issue. Safety characterization showed that sensitivity of the plasticized propellant is similar to JA 2. In short, replacing NG with SMX results in a new family of propellants with acceptable safety characteristics and which may also offer improved theoretical performance. ^ Finally, composite propellants based on SMX were theoretically and experimentally examined and compared to formulations based on ammonium perchlorate (AP). Thermochemical equilibrium calculations show that aluminized SMX-based formulations can achieve theoretical sea level specific impulse values upwards of 260 s– slightly lower than an AP-based composite. Both ignition sensitivity (tested via drop weight impact, electro-static discharge, and BAM friction) and physical properties (hardness and thermal properties) are comparable to those of the AP-based formulations. However, the SMX-based formulation could be detonated using a high explosive <b>donor</b> <b>charge</b> in contact with the propellant, as do other low smoke propellants. Differential scanning calorimetry of the SMX-based propellant indicated an exotherm onset of 140 °C, which corresponds to the known decomposition temperature of SMX. The propellant has a high burning rate of 1. 57 cm/s at 6. 89 MPa, with a pressure exponent of 0. 85. This high pressure sensitivity might be addressed using various energetic and/or stabilizing additives. ^ With high density and performance, smokeless combustion products, and stable combustion, SMX appears to be a viable replacement for existing energetic ingredients in a wide variety of propellant, explosive, and pyrotechnic applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Donations {{of money}} and time by {{households}} represent major sources of income, and support more generally, for Britain's voluntary organisations. Giving by households is not only quantitatively important, but usually affords voluntary organisations {{a greater degree of}} independence and autonomy when compared with income from government, corporate <b>donors,</b> <b>charges</b> for services, or membership dues. Moreover, giving is a valued form of participation by members of the public. It is a community used vehicle for altruism, reciprocation and collective action. Although recorded levels of monetary gifts and volunteering appear to have increased over the past four decades or more, there are indications from the most recent survey evidence that giving may have plateaued or even declined. Yet public policy is placing increasing emphasis on the contributions to be made by the voluntary sector, and voluntary organisations are increasingly aware of the need to maintain, and preferably boost, the contributions to their income from charitable donations. What, then, are the factors which determine levels of giving, and what are the prospects for the 1990 s? This paper examines economic aspects of charitable giving and reviews some of the slowly accumulating British evidence. It concludes with a discussion of the associated public policy issues for the 1990 s and beyond. ...|$|R
5000|$|In Success-N-Life, Tilton {{regularly}} {{taught that}} all of life's trials, especially poverty, were a result of sin. Tilton's ministry consisted mainly of impressing upon his viewers the importance of making [...] "vows"—financial commitments to Tilton's ministry. His preferred vow, stressed frequently on his broadcasts, was $1,000. Occasionally, Tilton would claim to have received a word of knowledge for someone to give a vow of $5,000 or even $10,000. When a person made a vow to Tilton, he preached that God would recognize the vow and reward the donor with vast material riches. The show also ran [...] "testimonials" [...] of viewers who gave to Tilton's ministry and reportedly received miracles in return, a practice {{that would be used}} as the basis for a later lawsuit from <b>donors</b> <b>charging</b> Tilton's ministry with fraud. A Dallas Morning News story published in 1992 observed that Tilton spent more than 84% of his show's airtime for fundraising and promotions, a total higher than the 22% for an average commercial television show; other sources put the total fundraising time during episodes of Success-N-Life closer to 68%. Some of Tilton's fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who heads a multimillion-dollar marketing empire writing donation letters for other televangelists like W.V. Grant and Don Stewart.|$|R
