40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the influence of the flexibility of the seat surface of a chair on the speed and time expended by students with spastic cerebral palsy during the performance of a task involving the manipulation an object while in a seated position. Eleven students of both genders participated in the study; all were diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy, and all had some control of trunk and upper limbs. The quantification of the kinematics analysis was done through two experimental situations: 1) performance of an academic task involving <b>fitting</b> <b>blocks</b> into matching holes, with the individual seated in an adapted seat with canvas seat surface; 2) performance of an academic task involving <b>fitting</b> <b>blocks</b> into matching holes, with the participant seated in an adapted seat with wooden seat surface. The data collected was submitted to descriptive analysis and non-parametric statistics using the Wilcoxon test. The results indicated that: 1) the average speed of performance of the tasks was not influenced by the type of seat surface 2) performance time for the task was influenced by the type of seat surface. The use of the canvas seat surface increased the accomplishment time for the task. This study concluded that the seat surface of school furniture for students with spastic cerebral palsy should not to be made from very flexible materials. This type of seat surface does not offer the necessary stability, and will be detrimental to the student's performance during activities involving the upper limbs...|$|E
40|$|Quilting (including the {{patchwork}} {{that the}} typical quilter indulges in) is primarily a leisure activity, one which on the surface seems to {{have little to do}} with functional programming. However, both the patchwork and the social participation in group projects often yield interesting combinatorial problems. This paper looks at the suitability of functional programming for solving these types of problems, considering two representative problems and their functional solutions. 1 INTRODUCTION People who participate in patchwork and quilting are generally referred to as quilters, and quilters frequently need to cope with mathematics, not just for calculations of fabric sizes and quantities, but also for combinatorial problems. Typically the problems fall into two categories: those concerning patchwork, and those concerning the social side of quilting.

While {{the assessment of the}} strength of an existing bridge is relatively well understood, the traffic loading it is subject to, has received less attention in the literature.

Studies in the literature have used many different methods to predict the lifetime maximum bridge load effect using a small amount of data, including <b>fitting</b> <b>block</b> maximum results to a Weibull distribution and raising maximum daily or maximum weekly distributions to an appropriate power. Two examples are used in this study to show the importance of the quantity of data in predicting the lifetime maximum distribution. In the first, a simple example is used for which the exact theoretical probabilities are available. Hence, the errors in estimations can be assessed directly. In the second, ‘long-run’ simulations are used to generate a very large database of load effects from which very accurate estimates can be deduced of lifetime maximum effects.

40|$|The growing {{industrialization}} of {{the construction}} materials, the evolution {{of the construction}} techniques and ease for conveyance, broadly speaking, eliminates the need to use local materials for construction. However, the earth still presents itself as a material with the potential to reintroduce the old and healthy construction habits, yet without precluding the search for technical innovations consistent with good environmental practices, and that may contribute to the formulation of simpler and cheaper processes. The current work developed the morphology of a new component of construction made with an easy acquisition and low cost material: soil-cement, a material and procedure proven, tested, and regulated.

Various methods have been suggested to overcome this problem without much loss of image quality. In this paper, such methods are reviewed and a coding scheme is suggested in which multiple domain blocks are used to approximate each range block.

40|$|The Species-Area Relationship (SAR) {{has been}} widely {{employed}} to assess species diversity and predict species extinction. Thus far, although many functions were proposed to fit SAR based on field observations or simulation results, the shape of SAR curve has been debated extensively over decades. Here we uncover a potential global-local inconsistency in SARs <b>fitting</b> simulation <b>blocked</b> by the limitation of large area sampling before. The results indicated that power and logarithm SAR formulas were good for the fitting if the sampling area range is small {{which is also the}} practical sampling interval in the field. However, for the logarithm SAR fitting, a sigmoid curve occurred in the log 10 Area - Number of Species plane, and for the power SAR fitting, the curve is convex instead of a straight line as assumed when linear regression was applied. In conclusion, neither the power SAR nor the logarithm SAR fitted to simulated data is linear at large sampling range as commonly assumed in previous studies, no matter the distribution of species abundance is log-normal or negative-binomial, which unmasks the global-local inconsistency in Species-Area Relationships fitting. Thus misestimates of total number of species or other derivation parameters can occur if the fitted relationship is extrapolated beyond the range of the small and intermediate sampling size...|$|R

40|$|Children’s {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} objects is the end-point of several important developments. To imagine objects in different positions greatly improves children’s action capabilities. They can relate objects {{to each other}} successfully, and plan actions involving more than one object. We know that one-year-olds can insert an object into an aperture. Earlier {{research has focused on}} the start and goal of such actions, but ignored the way in between. This thesis shows that children are unable to fit an object into an aperture unless they can imagine the different projections of the object and rotate it in advance. The problem of how to proceed with an object-aperture matching was studied in 14 - to 40 -month-old children with a box, different holes and a set of <b>fitting</b> wooden <b>blocks.</b> Study I focused on how to orient a single object to make it fit. Studies II and III added a second object or aperture, introducing choice. In Study I there was a huge difference between 18 and 22 months in solving the fitting problem. Successful insertion was related to appropriate pre-adjustments. The older children pre-adjusted the object orientation before arriving at the aperture(s). The younger used a feedback strategy and that did not work for this task. To choose was more difficult than expected; one must not only choose one alternative, but also inhibit the other. Fifteen-month-olds were unable to choose between sizes and shapes, 20 -month-olds could choose between sizes, 30 -month-olds could choose between sizes and shapes, but not even 40 -month-olds could choose between objects with different triangular cross-sections. Finally, the relationships between an object and an aperture, supporting surface or form were investigated. When comparing tasks requiring relationships between an object’s positive and an aperture’s negative form, between a 3 D and a 2 D, and between two 3 D-forms, we found that the main difficulties is relating positive and negative form...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{according}} to the patterns in the RMSexterior of the Kriging method and RMSinterior and RMSexterior of the block model (Fig.  6), the distribution of residuals greater than 5  mm/year along blocks B, C, D, E, F, and H of the block model (Fig.  6 b) generally corresponds to the high strain rate area derived from the horizontal velocity field, particularly for vectors in blocks D, E, F, and H (Fig.  6). Notably, orientations of some velocity vectors in blocks B and C, {{such as those of}} stations S 336 and G 126, are sub-perpendicular to the strikes of mountains (Fig.  4). Although there is no strong evidence proving that these vectors are contaminated by the deep-seated landslide, the poor data <b>fitting</b> of the <b>block</b> model in blocks B and C and the orientations of these vectors sub-normal to the strikes of mountains may imply that deep-seated landslide disturbs the horizontal velocities. In addition, folding or mud diapir in a mudstone area, which acts as a non-recoverable, inelastic strain, is a crucial structural feature in blocks D, E, F, and H (Hsieh 1972; Lacombe et al. 1997, 2004; Pan 1968; Shih 1967) (Fig.  6). Therefore, modeling surface deformation caused by active folding or mud diapir in a mudstone area is difficult by using an elastic block model. In addition to the possibilities of deep-seated landslide and active fold or mud diapir in a mudstone area, these residuals may be attributable to poorly defined block boundaries or unclear fault parameters, because a detailed geological investigation is still required to clarify the present-day characteristics of active structures.|$|R
40|$|We {{systematically}} studied {{structural and}} magnetic characteristics of size- monodispersed Fe and oxide-coated Fe cluster assemblies with the mean cluster sizes of 7 - 16 nm. Transmission electron microscopy and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) observations show that the Fe clusters in the assemblies maintain their original size at room temperature. In the SEM images, a random stacking of the Fe clusters and a porous structure with a low cluster packing fraction of about 25 % are observed. For the Fe cluster assemblies, magnetic coercivity (Hc) at room temperature increases from 4 × 101 to 4 × 102 Oe by increasing the mean cluster size from 7. 3 to 16. 3 nm. Using the experimental values of the coercivity at T? 100 K and the <b>fitting</b> values of <b>blocking</b> temperature TB from Hc=Hc 0 [1 -(T/TB) 1 / 2], we estimated the values of magnetic anisotropy constant K {{of the order of}} 106 erg/cm 3 from TB=KV/ 25 kB, which is larger by an order of magnitude than the bulk Fe value (5 × 105 erg/cm 3). Such a large effective anisotropy at T? 100 K is ascribed to the large surface anisotropy effects of the small clusters and the low cluster-packing fraction of the Fe cluster assemblies. For the oxide-coated Fe cluster samples, the coercivity strongly depends on the oxygen gas flow rate during deposition, cluster size, and temperature. In the case of a high oxygen gas flow rate (namely high surface-oxidized clusters), the ferrimagnetic oxide shell crystallites also affect the coercivity at T> 50 K: The hysteresis loop shift disappears, leading to a complex change in the coercivity and an enhancement of the effective anisotropy constant...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{operators}} run a {{very high}} risk of exposure to mechanical vibration. To improve comfort, many different devices have recently been fitted to agricultural self-propelled machinery, especially on the most modern high-powered wheeled tractors. In contrast, agricultural tracklaying tractors are not equipped with a suspended cab floor and frequently poor or no seat suspension is fitted. Consequently, the levels of vibration measured in the driving seat of tracklaying tractors often widely exceed the limit stipulated by official national standards. The manufacturers of tracklaying tractors are currently trying to improve the level of comfort at the driver’s place by reducing both the production and the transmission of vibration. The vibration levels at the driving seat {{of a group of}} tracklaying tractors produced by some leading Italian manufacturers were so measured. The models examined in the study differed in having either 5 - or 6 -roller track support, different types and stiffness of seat suspension, and in {{whether or not they were}} coupled to an implement. The type of seat suspension, and above all its correct adjustment, dramatically influenced the level of vibration, as did the increase in the number of track rollers. In contrast, whether or not the tractor was coupled to an implement at the rear 3 -point linkage did not make any significant change to the vibration comfort during transport. Also on the best modern trackalying tractor models, vibration levels frequently exceed stipulated limits, so that a further reduction is urgently required. Possible solutions that could be developed may involve the universal adoption of rubber tracks and/or the <b>fitting</b> of silent <b>blocks</b> on the cab floor and suspension devices on one or both axles...|$|R
40|$|Cancer is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} characterized by autonomous, uncontrollable cell proliferation, evasion of cell death, self-construction of oxygen and nutrient supply and spreading of cancerous cells through metastasis. It is vital to elucidate pathways that underlie the cancer process. Mechanistic cancer models, to this extent, attempt to relate the occurrence: of malignant neoplasm to diverse risk factors such as genetic alterations, susceptibility of individuals and exogenous and endogenous carcinogenic exposures. The main objectives of this thesis are to examine the validity of the two-hit hypothesis for retinoblastoma (Knudson, 1971, PNAS (68) 820 - 23), to unify multiple types of genomic instability and to further assess the role of genomic instability played in the process of carcinogenesis. I shall also explore characteristics of existing mechanistic cancer models. This thesis begins with a survey' of basic cancer biology and existing mechanistic models. Utilizing a fully-stochastic two-stage clonal expansion model, the thesis specifically assesses the validity of the two-hit theory for retinoblastoma-(RB), a childhood ocular malignancy. Comparison of fits of a variety of models (in particular those with up to three mutations) to a population-based RB dfltaset demonstrates the superior fit of the two-stage model to others. This result strongly suggests both the necessity and sufficiency of the two RBI mutations to initiate RB and hence validates the two-hit theory. The thesis goes on to develop a comprehensive,. framework to incorporate multiple types of genomic instability, characterized by-numerous numerical and structural damages exhibiting in the cancer cell genome. This generalized model embracesÃƒ?Ã‚?Ãƒ?Ã‚Â·;most, if not all, of the existing MVK-type models. Specific forms of the model are fitted to U. S. white American colon cancer incidence data. Based on comparison of fits to the population-based data, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that models with more than one type of genomic instability fits better than those with a single type of genomic instability. Since the age-specific incidence data may not possess sufficient information for model discrimination, further investigation is required. The remainder ofthis thesis is concerned with two theoretical aspects. To facilitate a Bayesian implementation for data <b>fitting,</b> a flexible <b>blocking</b> algorithm is developed. In the presence of parameter correlation, the algorithm considerably improves the performance of the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.
