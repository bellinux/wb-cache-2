In this context, we have the following research question: What does the adolescent experience about paternity? And {{the objective of the}} study: to understand the meaning of adolescent experience about paternity. Qualitative research of sustained phenomenological approach in theoretical-philosophical and methodological frame work of Martin Heidegger. The scenario for the production of the data was a South Health Center's Chapecó / SC linked to the Municipal Health Office. The subjects involved, there were five fathers, aged 18 to 24 years. The field stage was developed in two phases with one approach and ambiance with the scenario of there search and the production of data which came from the phenomenological interview with the following research question: <b>How</b> <b>is</b> it for you to be a father? and <b>How</b> <b>was</b> / <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>day</b> to day with the discovery of paternity? The interviews were audio recorded on an MP 3 type apparatus, and later transcribed by there searcher. The period for compiling the data was September and October of 2014, after approved by the ethics committee of the Federal University of Southern Frontier/ Campus Chapecó (UFFS / SC). The analysis stage occurred simultaneously to the field stage which showed the time to wax the interviews to reveal the sufficiency of meanings announced by the speeches. Data analysis was base don’t he theoretical framework of Martin Heidegger, who hast wo methodical moments, the vague understanding and median and the hermeneutic analysis. In this study, the first methodical time was used, understanding vague and median, which was developed from listening and attentive reading the interviews, through the suspension assumptions, {{in order to understand the}} meaning that be father-teenager expressed about fatherhood, without imposing predetermined categories by empirical knowledge. In the transcripts were underlined the essential structures, which formed the framework for analysis of the material. Subsequently, the meaning units were established: US 1 - Ever dreamed of being a father, no thought about it for now, when he found that would be father, he wished hiss on, and US 2 - He hadn't plans for the future, with the news, begin stop an the future. Thinks about living well with her son and family to be a real father; and the phenomenological discourse to compose the living concept that is: be-father-teenagering. The survey results also revealed that the be-fatherteenagering express desired paternity, even though un planned child. Announces that she brought you happiness and satisfaction. Demonstrates increased responsibilities and the possibility of returning to school. Reveals the will of caring for the child and be present in his life. Want to have a structured family an disconcerned with the education of children, think it is important that they go to school, because he wants to be a real father. Understanding the experience of paternity by be-father-teenagering reveals the need one empathic listening space to ensure the best care they ways. A paternidade na adolescência promove mudanças e estabelece novos papéis, como o de ser adolescente e ser pai frente à família e a sociedade. Diante desse contexto, tem-se a seguinte questão de pesquisa: Qual o significado da vivência do adolescente acerca da paternidade? E como objetivo do estudo: compreender o significado da vivência do adolescente acerca da paternidade. Pesquisa qualitativa de abordagem fenomenológica sustentada no referencial teórico-filosófico-metodológico de Martin Heidegger. O cenário para produção dos dados foi um Centro de Saúde da região Sul do município de Chapecó/SC vinculado a Secretaria de Municipal Saúde. Os sujeitos envolvidos foram cinco pais, na faixa etária dos 18 aos 24 anos. A etapa de campo foi desenvolvida em dois momentos sendo um deles aproximação e ambientação com o cenário da pesquisa e a produção dos dados a qual ocorreu a partir da entrevista fenomenológica com as seguintes questões de pesquisa: Como é para você ser pai? e Como foi/é seu dia-a-dia com a descoberta da paternidade? As entrevistas foram audiogravadas em um aparelho de MP 3, e posteriormente transcritas pela própria pesquisadora. O período para produção dos dados foi de setembro a outubro de 2014 após aprovação do Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul/ Campus Chapecó (UFFS/SC). A etapa de análise ocorreu simultaneamente à etapa de campo a qual demonstrou o momento de encerar as entrevistas ao revelar a suficiência de significados anunciados pelos discursos dos sujeitos. A análise dos dados foi pautada no referencial teórico metodológico de Martin Heidegger, que é composta por dois momentos metódicos, a compreensão vaga e mediana e a análise hermenêutica. Nesse estudo, foi utilizado o primeiro momento metódico, a compreensão vaga e mediana, a qual foi desenvolvida a partir da escuta e leitura atentiva das entrevistas, por meio da suspensão de pressupostos, com o objetivo de compreender o significado que o ser-pai-adolescendo expressou sobre a paternidade, sem impor categorias predeterminadas pelo conhecimento empírico. Nas transcrições foram sublinhadas as estruturas essenciais, as quais compuseram o quadro de análise do material. Posteriormente, foram constituídas as unidades de significação: US 1 - Sempre sonhou em ser pai, não pensava nisso para agora, quando soube desejou o filho e US 2 - Não tinha planos para o futuro, com a notícia começa a planejá-lo. Pensa em viver bem com o filho e a família para ser pai de verdade; e o discurso fenomenológico para se compor o conceito vivido qual seja: ser-pai-adolescendo. Os resultados da pesquisa também revelaram que o ser-paiadolescendo expressa que desejou a paternidade, mesmo não tendo planejado o filho. Anuncia que ela lhe trouxe felicidade e satisfação. Demonstra aumento das responsabilidades e a possibilidade de retornar aos estudos. Revela a vontade de cuidar do filho e estar presente na vida dele. Deseja ter uma família estruturada e preocupa-se com a educação dos filhos, acha importante que eles frequentem a escola, pois quer ser um pai de verdade. A compreensão da vivência da paternidade pelo ser-pai-adolescendo revela a necessidade de um espaço de escuta empática para que se assegure a eles melhores maneiras de assistência...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his first}} speech as mayor, Wildes named three issues as his top priorities: [...] "public education, {{property}} taxes, and bringing a fresh perspective to government." [...] In his first month in office, Wildes visited several elementary schools {{and middle schools}} in Englewood to begin a dialogue with students, {{as part of his}} plan to engage more young people in the political process. He talked to students about success and the American dream. At one such event, an elementary school student asked Wildes who his earliest political influence was. Wildes named John F. Kennedy. At another address at Dwight Morrow High School, he told the students, [...] "Never underestimate what being a good person can do for you. People remember the small things. Good morning, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>day</b> etc. and in return being a good person makes you marketable and appealing." [...] The same month, Wildes met with Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, then First Lady of Argentina.In February 2004, Wildes formed a task force to investigate reports by Latino immigrants living in Englewood that they had been targeted for exceedingly intrusive housing inspections. The Bergen Record printed reports of several raids in January 2004 that seemed to specifically target Colombian residents living on West, Charles, and James Streets. At a city council meeting in January, Donald Porrino, an Englewood Zoning officer, had denied targeting any ethnic group, and said inspections were intended to check for overcrowding and other fire safety risks. Wildes responded by saying, [...] "While the city has a sincere interest in averting fires and insuring that people live in hygienic conditions--we still have to insure that people's rights and homes are respected. When it comes to the safety and rights of individuals, an independent review is warranted". Wildes named Remberto Perez chairman of the investigative committee, although Christian Estevez replaced Perez in April. The task force judged raids were [...] "intrusive and bordered on civil rights violations." [...] In March 2004, Wildes ordered a study of Route 4 to check for possible repairs and other improvements to the highway.|$|E
