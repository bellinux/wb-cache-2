5000|$|AaE flight {{operations}} are somewhat complex and varied. [...] "Next Flight" [...] services use {{space on the}} next available scheduled Qantas passenger flights. Items carried for Overnight, 2 Day Economy and Off-Peak deliveries are flown on both Qantas and Australian airExpress aircraft operated by Express Freighters Australia, National Jet Systems subsidiary National Jet Express, and Pel-Air. The company does not service the Northern Territory 'overnight' from Sydney. Due to the three different service providers, AaE flights operate using different flight numbers and callsigns. The Express Freighters Australia Boeing 737s use Qantas flight numbers and callsigns as the ground handling is done by Qantas/Express Freighters, while National Jet Express uses the aircraft registration as their callsign and uses the IATA designator XM for its flight numbers (and uses the <b>ICAO</b> <b>designator</b> XME). Pel-Air flights also use XM flight numbers but have no specific callsigns. AaE also has an international Division called Australian airExpress International.|$|E

2500|$|The {{telephony}} designator (used {{instead of}} phonetically pronouncing the three letter company designator {{associated with the}} aircraft call sign) is usually assigned {{at the same time}} as the <b>ICAO</b> three letter <b>designator.</b> The call sign, together with a flight/trip number, is the aircraft identification for radio voice communications with air traffic personnel. The call sign for UND aircraft is [...] "Sioux".|$|R
500|$|When {{referring}} to different variants, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code collapses the 777 model designator and the -200 or -300 variant designator to [...] "772" [...] or [...] "773". [...] The International Civil Aviation Organization (<b>ICAO)</b> aircraft type <b>designator</b> system adds a preceding manufacturer letter for [...] "B772" [...] or [...] "B773". [...] Designations may append a range identifier like [...] "B77W" [...] for the 777-300ER by the ICAO, [...] "77W" [...] for the IATA. [...] Other notations include [...] "773ER", and [...] "773B".|$|R
50|$|When {{painted on}} the fuselage, the prefix and suffix are usually {{separated}} by a dash (for example, YR-BMA). When entered in a flight plan, the dash is omitted (for example, YRBMA). In some countries that use a number suffix rather than letters, like the United States (N), South Korea (HL), and Japan (JA), the prefix and suffix are connected without a dash. Aircraft flying privately usually use their registration as their radio callsign, but many aircraft flying in commercial operations (especially charter, cargo, and airlines) use the <b>ICAO</b> airline <b>designator</b> or a company callsign. In some instances, it may be sufficient to simply display the suffix letters, with the country prefix omitted. For example, gliders registered in Australia would omit the VH prefix and simply display the suffix. Obviously, this is only suitable where the aircraft does not fly in the airspace of another country.|$|R
500|$|When {{referring}} to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (767) and the variant designator (e.g. –200 or –300) into a truncated form (e.g. [...] "762" [...] or [...] "763"). Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may append the range identifier. The International Civil Aviation Organization (<b>ICAO)</b> aircraft type <b>designator</b> system uses a similar numbering scheme, but adds a preceding manufacturer letter; all variants {{based on the}} 767-200 and 767-300 are classified under the codes [...] "B762" [...] and [...] "B763"; the 767-400ER receives the designation of [...] "B764".|$|R
