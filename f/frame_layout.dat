Performance was revolutionised in 1973 by the introduction of No.1782 [...] "Revolution" [...] by Malcolm Goodwin, which was significantly faster than conventional Hornets. The hull shape was hydrodynamically optimised taking advantage of permitted tolerances, being built over a much stiffer frame to control its shape and stiffen its structure. Among other improvements an effective gybing centreboard was developed. Two other boats, Super Zonka and Short Circuit, were built at the same time, with gybing boards.Goodwin subsequently productionised his design and manufactured it in various forms: self assembly kits, part finished hulls, or finished boats. Tim Baker subsequently built composite boats from a Goodwin mould. Richard Lovett developed an interpretation of the new hull shape, and built two boats still known for their speed. Tim Coombe went on to build several more boats from the same frames.In 2000, a new deck mould was developed, and Speed, and later Bob Hoare, built around 10 new boats in FRP.

50|$|The MO-93, officially called Militärrad 93, was {{the first}} major re-development of the Swiss Army Bicycle, built by Villiger and Condor between 1993 and 1995. The basic <b>frame</b> <b>layout</b> was {{retained}} for compatibility with existing equipment, and outwardly appears roughly similar to the MO-05 except for its green color (technically: RAL 6014 F9 Gelboliv - olive-yellow). It was equipped with a 7-speed derailer gearing system, which is protected by a hefty guard at the rear axle. The MO-93 also differed by having a front carry rack fitted as standard equipment in addition to the rear carry rack. The front rack also served as a mounting for the new headlight assembly which was operated by an axle-mounted dynamo on the front wheel. It was also fitted with modern mountain-bicycle style handle-bars. Many other modern features were incorporated such as rim-brakes. The characteristic frame carry box was retained. Condor produced 5,500 units for the Swiss Army at a price of CHF 2,200. This bicycle is rather heavy, yet sturdy, at an average 25 kg. A few are still used at the Company 17 (Fallschirmaufklärer Kompanie 17) Special Forces base and Paratrooper school at Locarno-Magadino military airport in Southern Switzerland. According to the Swiss Army website, bicycles are currently used by cadet officers, sergeant majors, quartermasters, cooks, guards, in addition to physical training and movement between barracks and firing range.|$|E

40|$|All {{binaries}} {{compiled by}} recent versions of GCC from C++ programs include complex data and dedicated code for exception handling support. The data structures describe the call stack <b>frame</b> <b>layout</b> in the DWARF format byte-code. The dedicated code includes an interpreter of this bytecode and logic {{to implement the}} call stack unwinding. Despite being present in a large class of programs – and therefore poten-tially providing a huge attack surface – this mechanism is not widely known or studied. Of particular interest to us is that the exception handling mech-anism provides the means for fundamentally altering the flow of a program. DWARF is designed specifically for calculating call frame addresses and reg-ister values. DWARF expressions are Turing-complete and may calculate register values based on any readable data in the address space of the pro-cess. The exception handling data is in effect an embedded program residing within every C++ process. This paper explores what can be accomplished with control of the debugging information without modifying the program’s text or data. We also examine the exception handling mechanism and {{argue that it is}} rife for vulnerability finding, not least because the error states of a program are often those least well tested.

40|$|Abstract: Printed {{circuit boards}} (PCBs) are being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. Solder joints are often used to interconnect chip resistors and other components onto PCBs. The defects of solder joints will increase quality costs and deteriorate performance. If solder joints can’t be located accuracy, AOI system will not inspect solder joints at the right place of solder joints and must lead to misjudgement. Especially, the misjudgement will increase dramatically under uncertain noise disturbance to micro-size solder joints due to inaccuracy location. In this work, an eliminating uncertain noise method is proposed and a robust location algorithm for PCB’s solder joints is present. Firstly, some location windows are set based on technology parameters of chip and its solder joints, and solder joints feature image is obtained from it solder joint image based on series of image pre-processing. Secondly, the <b>layout</b> <b>frame</b> outside solder joints, which {{is viewed as a}} noise disturbance to location, is extracted as a binary image and is projected to X axis and Y axis, then the smaller region, which include solder joints but no the <b>layout</b> <b>frame,</b> is obtained based on calculating the sum features function of <b>layout</b> <b>frame.</b> Thirdly, the blob feature image of solder joints is extracted from its gray images of red, green, blue layers; it may have some noise blob around solder joints feature, then an evaluation function is develop to judge blob, which maybe belongs to noise or solder joints feature, and only solder joints feature are remained. Fourthly, with the help of setting solder joints windows, the integrated projection method is developed to locate solder joints. Finally, the proposed location method is compared with other two algorithms in the experiment. Experiment’s result illustrates that the smaller the solder joint size, the better location accuracy and efficiency is obtained than other two mothers. ...|$|R
