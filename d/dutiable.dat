25|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, the Morrill Tariff {{increased}} the effective rate collected on <b>dutiable</b> imports by approximately 70%. In 1860 American tariff rates were among {{the lowest in the}} world and also at historical lows by 19thcentury standards, the average rate for 1857 through 1860 being around 17% overall (ad valorem), or 21% on <b>dutiable</b> items only. The Morrill Tariff immediately raised these averages to about 26% overall or 36% on <b>dutiable</b> items, and further increases by 1865 left the comparable rates at 38% and 48%. Although higher than in the immediate antebellum period, these rates were still significantly lower than between 1825 and 1830, when rates had sometimes been over 50%.|$|E
25|$|The Morrill tariff bill came nearer {{than any}} other to meeting the double {{requirement}} of providing ample revenue {{for the support of}} the government and of rendering the proper protection to home industries. No national taxes, except duties on imported goods, were imposed {{at the time of its}} passage. The Civil War changed all this, reducing importations and adding tenfold to the revenue required. The government was justified in increasing existing rates of duty, and in adding to the <b>dutiable</b> list all articles imported, thus including articles of prime necessity and of universal use. In addition to these duties, it was compelled to add taxes on all articles of home production, on incomes not required for the supply of actual wants, and, especially, on articles of doubtful necessity, such as spirits, tobacco and beer. These taxes were absolutely required to meet expenditures for the army and navy, for the interest on the war debts and just pensions to those who were disabled by the war, and to their widows and orphans.|$|E
25|$|Many {{economists have}} argued that the sharp decline in {{international}} trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade. In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act at least worsened the Great Depression. Most historians and economists partly blame the American Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (enacted June 17, 1930) for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries. The average ad valorem rate of duties on <b>dutiable</b> imports for 1921–25 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931–35. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Parliament had {{repealed}} {{most of the}} Townshend taxes (keeping {{only the}} one on tea), and passed the Tea Act, which authorised the British East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea. [...] This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company's tea. In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis, since duties were to be paid on <b>dutiable</b> cargo within twenty days of a ship's arrival. [...] Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role {{in the choice of}} consignee. [...] Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed. [...] Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite citywide protests that the tea be sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed. [...] When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night and dumped the tea into the harbour.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Chan {{proceeded}} {{to examine the}} statutory scheme relating to the export of <b>dutiable</b> goods and the imposition of customs duty on such goods. He focused on regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, which provides as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Chan {{mentioned}} on an obiter {{basis that}} whether <b>dutiable</b> goods removed for export are illegally landed or whether such goods have been exported are questions of fact. Further, {{it must be}} proven by evidence whether a particular fact exists. Hence, regulation 12(6) requires {{the establishment of a}} [...] "precedent fact". It was insufficient that the DG had believed or opined that the goods had not been exported (no matter how reasonable the belief was); rather, it was a fact that had to be objectively ascertained. The applicant's company could only be liable to pay the customs duty levied on the goods after this fact has been established.|$|E
2500|$|He held that, as in Tameside, the [...] "satisfaction" [...] {{referred}} to in regulation 12(6) {{is not a matter}} of pure judgment or opinion. It is also concerned with an inquiry as to a fact, namely, whether <b>dutiable</b> goods have been exported. Thus, the applicant had to produce evidence to show that the goods had been exported and this evidence had to be to the satisfaction of the DG. Justice Chan affirmed that the test to ascertain if the DG's decision was valid was to determine if the DG could reasonably have come to his decision based on the evidence before him, or, in other words, whether the DG had decided based on a tenable factual basis.|$|E
6000|$|I {{showed him}} the mountain. Nobody was {{disturbing}} it; nobody was interested in it; all the family's attempts to get attention to it had failed--except {{in the case of}} one of the trunks containing the <b>dutiable</b> goods. It was just being opened. My officer said: ...|$|E
60|$|So, perhaps, as Sir Andrew {{gradually}} directed Marguerite {{through the}} tortuous streets of Calais, {{many of the}} population, who turned with an oath {{to look at the}} strangers clad in English fashion, thought that they were bent on purchasing <b>dutiable</b> articles for their own fog-ridden country, and gave them no more than a passing thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, the law is," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "that {{when people}} have any thing in their trunks that is <b>dutiable,</b> if they declare it, that is, {{acknowledge}} that they have it and show it to the officers, then they have only to pay the duty, and they may carry the article in. But {{if they do not}} declare it, but hide it away somewhere in their trunks, and the officers find it there, then the thing is forfeited altogether. The officers seize it and sell it {{for the benefit of the}} government." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a fatal admission. The {{officer at}} once made me pay sixpence [...] import-duty on the whisky-just from ship to shore, you see; and he [...] fined me L5 for not declaring the goods, another L5 for falsely [...] denying that I had {{anything}} <b>dutiable</b> about me, also L5 for [...] concealing the goods, and L50 for smuggling, {{which is the}} maximum [...] penalty for unlawfully bringing in goods under the value of [...] sevenpence ha'penny. Altogether, sixty-five pounds sixpence for a [...] little thing like that." ...|$|E
60|$|No longer seeking nor caring that my name {{should be}} blasoned abroad on title-pages, I smiled {{to think that}} it had now another kind of vogue. The Custom-House marker {{imprinted}} it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of <b>dutiable</b> merchandise, in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. Borne on such queer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a name conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and, I hope, will never go again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went ashore at Naples one voyage when I {{was in that}} trade, and [...] {{stood around}} helping my passengers, for I could speak a little [...] Italian. Two or three times, at intervals, the officer asked me if [...] I had {{anything}} <b>dutiable</b> about me, and seemed more and more put out [...] and disappointed every time I told him no. Finally a passenger whom [...] I had helped through {{asked me to come}} out and take something. I [...] thanked him, but excused myself, saying I had taken a whisky just [...] before I came ashore.|$|E
60|$|Inside {{the gate}} they stopped, waiting in a huddled group, {{with the same}} heavy patience, for the {{examination}} of the consumo. An officer of the custom-house went round with a long steel prong, which he ran into the baskets one by one, to see that there was nothing <b>dutiable</b> hidden in the earth. Then, sparing of his words, he made a sign to the driver and sat down again straddle-wise on his chair. 'Arre, burra!' The first donkey walked slowly on, and as they heard the tinkling of the leader's bell the rest stepped forward in the long line, their heads hanging down, with that hopeless movement of the feet.|$|E
60|$|A squalid {{little town}} grew {{up out of}} the flying gravel as we approached, and we left our state coach at the custom-house, which seemed the chief public edifice. There the {{inspectors}} did not go through the form of examining our hand-bags, as they would have done at an American frontier; and they did not pierce our carriage cushions with the long javelins with which they are armed for the detection of smuggling among the natives who have been shopping in Gibraltar. As the gates of that town are closed every day at nightfall by a patrol with drum and fife, and everybody is shut either in or out, it may easily happen with shoppers in haste to get through that they bring <b>dutiable</b> goods into Spain; but the official javelins rectify the error.|$|E
60|$|Then the House {{has been}} told that the Government might have given a {{preference}} on <b>dutiable</b> articles. Such a preference would introduce into our fiscal system an entirely new, and, as the Government think, the wholly vicious feature of discriminating between one class of producers and another. The whole basis of our financial and fiscal policy is, that it draws no distinction whatever between different classes of producers, whether they reside here or abroad, whether they live in foreign countries or in our Colonies. I am quite prepared to state that proposition in its simplest form. That is the fundamental principle of our fiscal system, and there is no discrimination. We have but one measure to give to those who trade with us--the just measure of equality, and there can be no better measure than that.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are charged}} with pedantry {{in dealing with the}} Colonial Conference, through not making some {{concession}} upon existing <b>dutiable</b> articles. The Colonial representatives, when they asked for a preference on wine and tobacco, did not ask for it because it was of value to them by itself. They knew well that the operation of such a preference must be unfair and unequal. They knew well that Canada, which has the most solid claims upon us for a preferential recognition, would receive no benefit from such a preference. But the Colonial representatives of South Africa asked for a preference on wine and tobacco in order that, as they avowed with candour, we should [...] "concede the principle." [...] That is a perfectly proper proceeding on their part; it is the natural way of advancing the views which they hold, because it would lead up to the larger principle and the larger policy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} editor, [...] "I think I am, from my {{peculiar}} standpoint. The other day {{a friend of}} mine--an upright, just, worthy man, no one more so--was telling me of a shocking instance of our national corruption. He had just got home from Europe, and he had {{brought a lot of}} <b>dutiable</b> things, that a customs inspector passed for a trifling sum. That was all very well, but the inspector afterwards came round with a confidential claim for a hundred dollars, and the figures to show that the legal duties would have been eight or ten times as much. My friend was glad to pay the hundred dollars; but he defied me to name any country in Europe where such a piece of official rascality was possible. He said it made him ashamed of America!" [...] Evans leaned his head back against his chair and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Yes; but {{let those}} who reproach us with pedantry and with not showing a {{sympathetic}} desire {{to meet the}} Colonies listen to this: When such a statement is made by a Minister, is it accepted as a desire {{on the part of}} the Government to extend sympathetic treatment to the Colonies? Not at all. It is taken as an admission, and used for the purpose of trying to pretend that the Government have abandoned the principle of their opposition to the larger question of Imperial preference. If, although we think them unsatisfactory, we were, out of complaisance, to accord the small preferences suggested upon <b>dutiable</b> articles, we should be told in a minute that we had given up every logical foothold against preference, and that nothing prevented us imposing a tax on bread and meat except our inability to follow the drift of our own arguments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is not}} so easy. But I may {{say that}} the {{friendly}} ironies began for us {{as soon as we}} were out of the more single-minded keeping of the ship's stewards, who had brought our hand-baggage ashore, and, after extracting the last shilling of tip from us, had delivered us over to the keeping of the customs officers. It began with the joking tone of the inspectors, who surmised that we were not trying to smuggle a great value into the country, and with their apologetic regrets for bothering us to open so many trunks. They implied that it was all a piece of burlesque, which we were bound mutually to carry out for the gratification of a Government which enjoyed that kind of thing. They indulged this whim so far as to lift out the trays, to let the Government see that there was nothing <b>dutiable</b> underneath, where they touched or lifted the contents with a mocking hand, and at times carried the joke so far as to have some of the things removed. But they helped put them back with a smile for the odd taste of the Government. I do not suppose that an exasperating duty was ever so inexasperatingly fulfilled." ...|$|E
60|$|G. {{got away}} from Nauheim {{just in time to}} escape being shut in by the quarantine-bars on the frontiers; and so did we, for we left the next day. But G. {{had a great deal of}} trouble in getting by the Italian custom-house, and we should have fared {{likewise}} but for the thoughtfulness of our consul-general in Frankfort. He introduced me to the Italian consul-general, and I brought away from that consulate a letter which made our way smooth. It was a dozen lines merely commending me in a general way to the courtesies of servants in his Italian Majesty's service, but it was more powerful than it looked. In addition to a raft of ordinary baggage, we had six or eight trunks which were filled exclusively with <b>dutiable</b> stuff--household goods purchased in Frankfort for use in Florence, where we had taken a house. I was going to ship these through by express; but at the last moment an order went throughout Germany forbidding the moving of any parcels by train unless the owner went with them. This was a bad outlook. We must take these things along, and the delay sure to be caused by the examination of them in the custom-house might lose us our train. I imagined all sorts of terrors, and enlarged them steadily as we approached the Italian frontier. We were six in number, clogged with all that baggage, and I was courier for the party--the most incapable one they ever employed.|$|E
6000|$|The talk {{concerning}} the impious {{possession of the}} Old Free Grace Meeting-House was at its height when the official consciousness of the Collector, who was just then laboring under his constitutional infirmity, became suddenly seized with an irrepressible alarm. He declared that he smoked something worse than the Devil upon Pig and Sow Point, and protested {{that it was his}} opinion that Captain Obadiah was doing a bit of free-trade upon his own account, and that <b>dutiable</b> goods were being smuggled in at night under cover of these incredible stories. He registered a vow, sealing it with the most solemn protestations, and with a multiplicity of ingenious oaths that only a mind stimulated by the heat of intoxication could have invented, that he would make it his business, upon the first occasion that offered, to go down to Pig and Sow Point and to discover for himself whether it was the Devil or smugglers that had taken possession of the Old Free Grace Meeting-House. Thereupon, hauling out his precious snuffbox and rapping upon the lid, he offered a pinch around. Then calling attention to the inscription, he demanded to know whether a man who had behaved so well upon that occasion had need to be afraid of a whole churchful of devils. [...] "I would," [...] he cried, [...] "offer the Devil a pinch, as I have offered it to you. Then I would bid him read this and tell me whether he dared to say that black was the white of my eye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Abolition of the {{remaining}} duty upon corn; an exceeding strong case. 2. I should be much disposed to abolish the tea licences as greatly restrictive of the consumption of a <b>dutiable</b> and useful commodity. I modified them; but {{am not sure that}} this was enough. The B.I.R. could throw light on this subject. 3. The probate duty calls, I fear, loudly for change; but I wanted either time or courage to take it in hand. 4. The remaining conveyance duties, apart from railways, I always considered as marked for extinction. On this subject Mr. Ayrton has rather decided antecedents. 5. The fire insurance duty is sure to be further assailed. Though not as bad (relatively to other taxes) as is supposed, it is bad enough to be very hard to defend in an adverse House; {{and this is one of}} the questions on which it is not likely that the opposition will help to see fair play. The promises that liberal reduction will lead to recovery of anything like the old or previous revenue have always been confidently pressed by irresponsible men, and are in my opinion illusory. The tax is a tax on property: and, as we have too few of these rather than too many, what would seem desirable is to commute it; leaving no more than a penny stamp on the policy. This might perhaps be done, if it were made part of a large budget. 6. The income-tax at 6d., I suppose, presents a forward claim. 7. The commutation of malt duty for beer duty must always, I presume, be spoken of with respect; but the working objections to it have thus far been found too hard to deal with.|$|E
60|$|At Ponte Centino my {{passport}} was examined, and I was invited {{into an office}} where sat the papal custom-house officer, a thin, subtle-looking, keen-eyed, sallow personage, of aspect very suitable to be the agent of a government of priests. I communicated to him my wish to pass the custom-house without giving the officers the trouble of examining my luggage. He inquired whether I had any <b>dutiable</b> articles, and wrote for my signature a declaration in the negative; and then he lifted a sand-box, beneath which was a little heap of silver coins. On this delicate hint I asked what was the usual fee, {{and was told that}} fifteen pauls was the proper sum. I presume it was entirely an illegal charge, and that he had no right to pass any luggage without examination; but the thing is winked at by the authorities, and no money is better spent for the traveller's convenience than these fifteen pauls. There was a papal military officer in the room, and he, I believe, cheated me in the change of a Napoleon, as his share of the spoil. At the door a soldier met me with {{my passport}}, and looked as if he expected a fee for handing it to me; but in this he was disappointed. After I had resumed my seat in the coupe, the porter of the custom-house--a poor, sickly-looking creature, half dead with the malaria of the place--appeared, and demanded a fee for doing nothing to my luggage. He got three pauls, and looked but half contented. This whole set of men seem to be as corrupt as official people can possibly be; and yet I hardly know whether to stigmatize them as corrupt, because it is not their individual delinquency, but the operation of a regular system. Their superiors know what men they are, and calculate upon their getting a living by just these means. And, indeed, the custom-house and passport regulations, as they exist in Italy, would be intolerable if there were not this facility of evading them at little cost. Such laws are good for nothing but to be broken.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{confusion}} as to the actual tariff level imposed by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. In the two volume series published by the US Bureau of the Census entitled [...] "The Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition," [...] tariff rates have been represented in two forms. On page 888, the first measure (series U211) is the [...] "free and <b>dutiable</b> tariff rate" [...] which is the tariff revenue divided by the dollar sum of both <b>dutiable</b> and non-dutiable imports. The second measure (series U212) is the [...] "dutiable tariff rate" [...] which is the tariff revenue divided by the dollar value of <b>dutiable</b> imports. The [...] "dutiable tariff rate" [...] peak of 1932 was 59.1%, {{second only to the}} 61.7% rate of 1830. However, in 1933, 63% of all imports were never taxed which the [...] "dutiable tariff rate" [...] does not reflect. The [...] "free and <b>dutiable</b> rate" [...] in 1929 was 13.5% and peaked under Smoot-Hawley in 1933 at 19.8% which is significantly below the 29.7% [...] "free and <b>dutiable</b> rate" [...] that the United States averaged from 1821 until 1900.|$|E
