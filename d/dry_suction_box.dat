40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes?</b> How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes.</b> The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

Through optimal hydraulic design of pumping system it is possible to generate better flow conditions for pump, to reduce hydraulic losses both in <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage and improve pumping system efficiency. Guiding principles and evaluation indexes for optimal hydraulic design of pumping system was proposed, and a case study was given to illustrate the effect of optimal design on the pumping system performances. The time-averaged three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were closed by RNG turbulence model and SIMPLEC arithmetic was adopted to couple pressure and velocity fields. Computed results indicate that with the given water level data and within the limitations of civil construction dimensions, the flow conditions of pump in terms of bias angle and distribution uniformity of axial velocity are effectively improved through optimal design, and hydraulic losses of <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage are decreased by 0. 115 m and the pumping system efficiency are improved by 2. 02 %.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies on <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering, three mechanisms were identified that determine the dry {{content of a}} web, viz. web compression, displacement of water by air and rewetting. In the present work, {{the relative importance of}} the three mechanisms was investigated through direct measurement of the web deformation, the dry content changes during and after the suction pulse, the air flow through the fibre network and the saturation of the web after the suction pulse. Suction pressure, suction time and rewetting time were varied. The experiments were done with chemical and mechanical pulp webs of various grammages. It was found that a large web deformation took place during the suction pulse, particularly at its beginning. Compression dewatering was found to be the most dominant dewatering mechanism. Displacement dewatering started after most of the web compression had occurred. Its contribution to the increase in dry content was most pronounced for higher suction pressures, longer suction times and for chemical pulp webs. A surprisingly large expansion of the web was observed immediately after the suction pulse. This expansion was the effect of rewetting. This rewetting strongly reduced the dry content of the web if the web had not been immediately separated from the forming fabric {{at the end of the}} suction pulse. Under the conditions studied, the decrease in dry content amounted to the order of 3 to 6 %. Rewetting was smaller for longer suction times and higher suction pressures. A considerable air flow through the web occurred under these conditions. This air flow apparently moved water from the forming fabric into the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> thus making less water available for rewetting. Rewetting for mechanical pulp webs was more pronounced and took place faster than for chemical pulps. The use of a membrane on top of the web during <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering proved to be advantageous for reducing the air flow through the web. However, under the conditions investigated, the dry content could not be improved. Although the web compression was increased when using a membrane, especially at a higher suction pressure, rewetting after the suction pulse had an even larger negative impact on the dry content, which, as a result, was lower.

A decrease in the water content due to an applied suction for clays with significant osmotic efficiencies was explained by two mechanisms. In mechanism 1, the water content decrease prior to the air entry is controlled by the interparticle repulsive pressure, and in mechanism 2, a decrease in the degree of saturation following the air entry is primarily due to the matric suction. The agreements between the AEVs of the clays determined based on the osmotic suctions corresponding to various applied suctions and that determined from the suction – degree of saturation SWCCs were found to be very good...|$|R

Previous work has provided insight into the physics ofdifferent devices employed in blade forming. However, there hasbeen a lack of models enabling studies of the effects of theinteraction between different components on the pressuredistribution. In the thesis, a model is presented for a genericblade forming section consisting of three blades. The positionsof two of the blades are fix, and in between them is located asuction box. The third blade is applied by a prescribed forceto the opposing wire, in a position facing the <b>suction</b> <b>box.</b> Themodel admits the study of the interaction between the pulsesfrom the different blades in the blade/counterbladeconfiguration, and between the pulses and one-sidedsuction. The wires are modelled as tensioned and perfectly flexibleEuler-Bernoulli beams of negligible mass. The suspension istreated like an inviscid fluid. Consideration is taken to theinfluence of fibre deposition on the permeability of thefabrics. By assuming the ratio between the length scales in thethickness direction and the machine direction to be small, aquasi one-dimensional model is obtained. For maximum flexibility, the model domain is divided intomodules. Each module is solved individually using a finitedifference based discretisation. The solutions for thedifferent modules are matched with each other iteratively. A comparison with published results for a single bladeindicates that the model can be used to obtain qualitativelycorrect predictions of the pressure distribution.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a water retention model capable of predicting the hysteretic response of soils during both wetting–drying cycles at constant void ratio and compression–swelling cycles at constant suction. In the proposed model two main surfaces – the main wetting and main drying surfaces – enclose {{the domain of}} attainable soil states {{in the degree of}} saturation–suction–void ratio space. Inside this domain, the variation of degree of saturation is governed by a reversible scanning law, which describes the transition from one main surface to the other. A simplified calibration procedure is presented to select the values of the four parameters defining the two main surfaces by using a minimum of two compression tests at constant <b>suction</b> and one <b>drying</b> test at constant mean net stress. Model computations are validated against results from an experimental campaign on a compacted mixture of bentonite and kaolin.

Moreover, during main wetting or main <b>drying</b> at high <b>suction</b> (i. e. at low saturation), the model correctly predicts a ‘virgin' retention line that uniquely relates water ratio and suction regardless of the current value of void ratio...|$|R
40|$|A thermo-mechanical {{constitutive}} model for unsaturated clays is constructed {{based on the}} existing model for saturated clays originally proposed by the authors. The saturated clays model was formulated {{in the framework of}} critical state soil mechanics and modified Cam-clay model. The existing model has been generalized to simulate the experimentally observed behavior of unsaturated clays by introducing Bishop's stress and suction as independent stress parameters and modifying the hardening rule and yield criterion {{to take into account the}} role of suction. Also, according to previous studies, an increase in temperature causes a reduction in specific volume. A reduction in suction (wetting) for a given confining stress may induce an irreversible volumetric compression (collapse). Thus an increase in <b>suction</b> (<b>drying)</b> raises a specific volume i. e. the movement of normal consolidation line (NCL) to higher values of void ratio. However, some experimental data confirm the assumption that this reduction is dependent on the stress level of soil element. A generalized approach considering the effect of stress level on the magnitude of clays thermal dependency in compression plane is proposed in this study. The number of modeling parameters is kept to a minimum, and they all have clear physical interpretations, to facilitate the usefulness of model for practical applications. A step-by-step procedure used for parameter calibration is also described.

40|$|Numerous field {{monitoring}} {{programs have}} been conducted to investigate the performance of an unsaturated soil slope subjected to rainfalls in wet seasons. Most case histories focus on the response of matric suction, {{which is one of}} the two stress-state variables governing unsaturated soil behaviour. However, effects due to another variable, net normal stress, are often ignored. Also, slope performance under alternative wet and dry seasons is rarely reported and analysed. In this study, a saprolitic hillslope situated in Hong Kong was instrumented heavily to investigate its seasonal movement due to changes of the two variables and also groundwater flow mechanism. Two-year seasonal variations of matric suction and net normal stress were monitored by tensiometers together with heat dissipation matric water potential sensors and earth pressure cells, respectively. During heavy rainstorms in wet season, there was a substantial recharge of the main groundwater table, causing a significant increase of positive pore-water pressure in deeper depths. Rupture surface likely developed at depths between 5. 5 and 6 m, hence resulting in a "deep-seated" mode of downslope movement. The downslope movement resulted in a peak increase of horizontal stress. In <b>dry</b> seasons, matric <b>suction</b> of up to 190 kPa was recorded, and the associated soil shrinkage led to substantial upslope rebounds. The stress built up in wet seasons hence reduced.

The saturated clays model was formulated {{in the framework of}} critical state soil mechanics and modified Cam-clay model. The existing model has been generalized to simulate the experimentally observed behavior of unsaturated clays by introducing Bishop's stress and suction as independent stress parameters and modifying the hardening rule and yield criterion {{to take into account the}} role of suction. Also, according to previous studies, an increase in temperature causes a reduction in specific volume. A reduction in suction (wetting) for a given confining stress may induce an irreversible volumetric compression (collapse). Thus an increase in <b>suction</b> (<b>drying)</b> raises a specific volume i. e. the movement of normal consolidation line (NCL) to higher values of void ratio. However, some experimental data confirm the assumption that this reduction is dependent on the stress level of soil element. A generalized approach considering the effect of stress level on the magnitude of clays thermal dependency in compression plane is proposed in this study. The number of modeling parameters is kept to a minimum, and they all have clear physical interpretations, to facilitate the usefulness of model for practical applications. A step-by-step procedure used for parameter calibration is also described. The model is finally evaluated using a comprehensive set of experimental data for the thermo-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils...|$|R
40|$|Evapotranspiration from a grass-covered {{ground is}} known to induce suction by soil {{evaporation}} and grass transpiration. However, grass-induced suction in the ground when it is subjected to wetting and drying are not yet well understood. In this study, a laboratory test program was conducted to investigate the magnitude and distribution of suction induced by Bermuda grass growing in silty sand. In total, four test boxes compacted with silty sand were prepared, three of which covered with Bermuda grass while one test box was left bare as control. All the four test boxes were subjected to wetting and drying in a plant room with temperature and humidity controlled. Under identical atmospheric conditions and initial soil density and water content, peak suction induced within the root zone in grassed soil was 1. 5 times higher than that in bare soil after 20 days of <b>drying.</b> A vertical <b>suction</b> influence zone was identified {{to be up to}} four times the root depth while the lateral suction influence zone was one diameter of ring collar away from the centre of the plot. Upon wetting, suction retained at depth right below the root zone in grassed soil was found to be 40 % higher than that in bare soil. For three grass replicates that were germinated under identical atmospheric conditions, they produced different shoot lengths and induced different magnitudes of suction. No direct correlation between grass shoot length and grass-induced suction could be found. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{tends to}} occur with {{rainfall}} runoff, thus leading to grave {{soil and water}} loss. An increase of water content in soil caused by rain makes the loss of matrix suction and the decrease of shear strength obvious, and will promote soil erosion. The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) {{can be used to}} describe the relationship between the water content and the matrix suction in unsaturated soil. For this paper we studied the SWCCs of the granite residual soils in a collapsing erosion area in Jiangxi Province, China. A GEO-Experts pressure plate extractor was used to measure SWCCs for soils with different dry density, grain size, drying and wetting cycles, and lime content. The initial dry density has a significant impact on SWCC. With increasing <b>dry</b> density, the <b>suction</b> was decreased for the same water content. The larger the grain size, the greater the suction value for the same volumetric water content. Under the same suction, the volumetric water content decreases as the lime percentage increases and water stability improves. SWCCs of the drying and wetting cycle demonstrate the hysteresis phenomenon. The area of the hysteresis loop decreased with the increase of the dry density and drying and wetting cycle number. It also became small when the soils were mixed with lime. In this paper, the Van Genuchten model, the Fredlund and Xing model, and the Gardner model were used to fit the experimental data of SWCCs. The presented fitting parameters show that the residual sum of squares is less than 0. 002. All the experimental data fit well to three models for SWCC. The results indicated that the simulated value of the Gardner model does provide best agreement with the measured value. These results will provide an important basis for the further study of the soil collapsing erosion process and soil cover design...|$|R
40|$|Shear modulus, G 0, at {{very small}} strains (0. 001 % or less) {{is one of}} {{important}} parameters for predicting dynamic response and behaviour of soils for many engineering problems such as design and analysis of earth retaining structures for earthquakes and static loads. With the advancement of use of bender elements in soil testing, anisotropic G 0 can now be determined by measuring velocity of shear wave propagating in different planes of a soil specimen. It leads to the evaluation of anisotropy of G 0. While most studies of the anisotropy have been conducted on saturated soils, experimental studies of anisotropy of unsaturated soils have rarely been carried out. This study aims to characterize anisotropic shear moduli (G 0 (ij)), of intact and recompacted specimens of a completely decomposed tuff (CDT) under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. A CKC triaxial test apparatus was modified to measure shear wave velocity and hence shear moduli at different suctions in three polarization planes at different stress states using bender elements. Three series of triaxial tests were conducted on intact and recompacted specimens under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. The test programme included isotropic compression tests at constant <b>suction,</b> <b>drying</b> and wetting tests at constant net mean stress and shearing tests at constant stress ratio and suction. Experimental results indicate that degree of anisotropy, expressed by G 0 (hh) /G 0 (hv)), of intact and recompacted specimens is 1. 45 and 1. 05 on average respectively. In isotropic compression tests conducted on intact and recompacted specimens, for a given suction, the degree of anisotropy appears to be independent of net mean stress ranging from 110 kPa to 500 kPa. In drying and wetting tests conducted on recompacted specimens, for a given net mean stress, change {{of the degree of}} anisotropy is less than 2 % as matric suction varies within a range of 0 kPa to 250 kPa. In shearing tests, for given values of both stress ratio and suction, variation of the degree of anisotropy is less than 4 % as deviatoric stress increases from 110 kPa to 500 kPa. It appears that net mean stress and matric suction do not induce anisotropic shear modulus but an increase in stress ratio results in a reduction of degree of anisotropy. These findings are consistent with predictions using empirical equations proposed in this study. During a drying and wetting cycle at constant net mean stress, there is a marked hysteresis loop of shear wave velocity and hence shear modulus measured during a cycle of drying and wetting for recompacted specimens...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated highly expansive clays. Given {{the high cost}} of damage to buildings, structures and roads caused by unexpected ground movements associated with unsaturated highly expansive clays and the increasing use of compacted expansive clays for engineered barriers for environmental protection and other purposes, it was considered important to investigate the behaviour of these materials. Previous researchers had reported the occurrence of substantial irreversible components of either wetting-induced swelling or drying-induced shrinkage during cycles of wetting and drying performed on unsaturated highly expansive clays containing active clay mineral such as montmorillonite. This form of irreversible behaviour cannot be represented by existing elasto-plastic models for unsaturated non-expansive clays. It had therefore been suggested that the behaviour of unsaturated highly expansive clays was fundamentally different to that of unsaturated non-expansive clays, and that the constitutive models developed for unsaturated non-expansive clays were inappropriate. The behaviour of an unsaturated highly expansive compacted bentonite/kaolin mix under isotropic stress states has been studied in a programme of controlled-suction tests incorporating isotropic loading and unloading at constant suction and cycles of wetting and <b>drying</b> (variation of <b>suction)</b> performed either under constant load or at constant volume. A smaller series of tests was also performed on unsaturated compacted samples of non-expansive pure kaolin. Either net shrinkage or net swelling occurred over a wetting/drying cycle for samples of the same soil, depending upon the compaction pressure. Irreversible shrinkage or swelling occurred during subsequent wetting/drying cycles, not just during the first cycle. Net shrinkage during a wetting/drying cycle was sometimes accompanied by a distinct change of stiffness (a yield point) during the appropriate drying path, but at other times was not. Yield points were never observed during both drying and wetting stages of a cycle. Net shrinkage or swelling during a wetting/drying cycle was always accompanied by a substantial net change of degree of saturation Sr during the cycle (termed hydraulic hysteresis). Experimental evidence showed that there is no fundamental difference between the mechanical behaviours of unsaturated highly expansive soils and unsaturated non-expansive soils. The experimental results suggested that unified modelling for both unsaturated highly expansive soils and unsaturated non-expansive soils is desirable. A new constitutive modelling framework is therefore proposed. In the modelling framework new forms of stress variables, with conjugate strain increment parameters, are used for the first time. Results from theoretical analysis of the influence of suction on inter-particle forces are used in developing the modelling framework. The influence of hydraulic hysteresis on stress strain behaviour is included in the framework, which has been developed {{in such a way that}} the otherwise difficult, transition between saturated and unsaturated conditions can be modelled in a relatively straightforward fashion. In the new modelling framework, both net shrinkage and net swelling during wetting/drying cycles, can be explained...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tried to}} {{evaluate}} the veracity of Grant and Groenevelt (2015) assertion that the inflection point on the water retention curve (WRC), plotted on semi-log scale, marks the onset of hydraulic stress in plants grown in sandy soils. That is, as the soil dries during drainage and evapotranspiration, {{there comes a point}} (argued to be the inflection point) when the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cannot keep up with plant demand for water; thus, plants begin to suffer. Interest in the inflection point stemmed from the need to find unbiased criteria to weight the water capacity downward in the integral water capacity (IWC) model of Groenevelt et al. (2001) to account for soil hydraulic restrictions. If the inflection point was truly a good indicator of the onset of plant stress, then the matric suction at this point can easily be found from the fitting parameter, kₒ (m), in Grant and Groenevelt (2015) water retention model; by coincidence it can also be found from the fitting parameter, 1 /α (m) in the water retention model of (Van Genuchten 1980). The experimental components of this study consisted of two main parts: In the first part, water retention curves for a range of different sands and sandy soils were prepared, their inflection points identified, and two points {{on either side of the}} inflection point (wetter and drier) identified (Chapters 3 and 4). In the second part, wheat plants were grown in a glasshouse to Zadoks et al. (1974) growth stage 21 in pots of the different sands held, constant, at three different soil water suctions: at, above and below the inflection point (Chapter 5). Detailed water retention curves were prepared using multiple replicates (up to 20) of four sands and two sandy soils (Very coarse sand, Coarse sand, Medium sand, Fine sand, Very fine sand, and Sandy loam) placed in small rings on ceramic pressure plates at different matric suctions ranging from saturation to 25 kPa or greater. Each of the individual sets of water retention data (up to 20) were fitted to the water retention models of Groenevelt and Grant (GG), and Van Genuchten (VG), and the inflection points identified from the appropriate fitting parameters. As might be expected, the different models produced slightly different inflection points, but these indeed corresponded pretty well (but not precisely) with kₒ and 1 /α respectively. There was a strong inverse correlation between the mean particle size of the sands and sandy soils, and the values of kₒ and 1 /α; that is, the inflections points shifted to greater matric suctions as mean particle size decreased, such that the Very coarse sand had the smallest values of kₒ and 1 /α while the Sandy loam had the largest values of kₒ and 1 /α. Because the VG model fitted the measured water retention data slightly better than did the GG model, the parameters from the VG model were chosen to identify the soil water conditions for the plant experiments. The matric suction at the inflection point, hᵢ (m), was identified from 1 /α, and this corresponded with the maximum differential water capacity, C(hᵢ). The wetter, hw, and <b>drier,</b> hd, matric <b>suctions</b> were chosen to correspond with the matric suctions at 90 % of the maximum differential water capacity (on either side of the inflection point). The value 90 % was chosen as being close to the inflection point yet falling outside its 95 % confidence interval. The (up to) 20 estimates of hw, hi and hd were used to identify the corresponding volumetric water contents directly from the water retention curves, and these were averaged and converted to gravimetric water contents that could be used to set up the soil water conditions in the pot study. Following a 6 x 2 x 3 completely randomised factorial design, litre-sized pots of each sand or sandy soil (5 replicates) were set up at the three different water contents corresponding to hw, hi and hd, (covered in plastic beads to minimise evaporation) and wheat seeds (2 different genotypes) planted and grown in them to growth stage 21. To keep soil water contents constant, daily pot weights were recorded and then water added (calibrated for increasing plant mass over time) to replace water evapo-transpired. The measure of plant response to the soil water conditions was the mass (fresh and dry) of shoots and roots. Although one of the wheat genotypes performed significantly better than the other (consistent with the literature), the F-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the wheat genotypes never responded to the soil moisture conditions or matric suction effects at or surrounding the inflection point. Possible reasons for the lack of response to the soil moisture conditions may be related to the choice of the wet and dry-side matric heads, particularly on the dry side; that is, the matric <b>suction</b> on the <b>dry</b> side of the inflection point, which corresponded to 90 % of the maximum water capacity, may not be sufficiently dry to induce a hydraulic stress. Contrast to this, was the source of variation that arose from the three and two factor interaction effects on the dry weights of shoot and root respectively, which showed significant differences. However, this was not convincing enough for one to accept the null hypothesis of the study due to the inconsistent nature of trends observed in the dry weights obtained at or surrounding the inflection point matric suction. On this basis, the importance of the inflection point as a marker of hydraulic stress in plants is not rejected at this stage – further research is needed. Thesis (M. Phil.)
