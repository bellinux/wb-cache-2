5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich yellow color.

5|$|The {{other major}} reagent is a camphor-derived reagent {{developed}} by Varinder Aggarwal of the University of Bristol. Both enantiomers are easily synthesized, although the yields {{are lower than}} for the oxathiane reagent. The ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor moiety. The reaction <b>employs</b> <b>a</b> phosphazene base to promote formation of the ylide.|$|E

Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates <b>employs</b> <b>a</b> Pelton turbine.

5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions.
