In the early 1960s, the company's sales of crossbar switches exceeded those of their rotating 500-switching system, as measured {{in the number of}} lines. Crossbar switching quickly spread {{to the rest of the}} world, replacing most earlier designs like the Strowger (step-by-step) and Panel systems in larger installations in the U.S. Graduating from entirely electromechanical control on introduction, they were gradually elaborated to have full electronic control and a variety of calling features including short-code and speed-dialing. In the UK the Plessey Company produced a range of TXK crossbar exchanges, but their widespread rollout by the British Post Office began later than in other countries, and then was inhibited by the parallel development of TXE reed relay and <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems,</b> so they never achieved a large number of customer connections although they did find some success as tandem switch exchanges.|$|E

Funded by the National Science Foundation and developed from 1974-1978 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) by Murray Turoff based on his earlier EMISARI done at the now-defunct Office of Emergency Preparedness, EIES was intended to facilitate group communications that would allow groups to {{make decisions based on}} their collective intelligence rather than the lowest common denominator.

40|$|In the U. S., several {{exchanges with}} {{different}} market microstructure designs compete to provide quotes and attract order flow {{on a common}} set of stock options. In this article, we analyze how the different microstructure designs affect the price discovery of options quotes and how they alter the flow of options trading activities over time. We find that the fully <b>electronic</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> at the International Secu-rities Exchange (ISE), where several market makers provide quotes independently and anonymously to compete for order flow within the exchange, generates options quotes that are the most informative and the most executable, with the narrowest bid–ask spreads. Over time, the ISE’s leading quote quality has attracted order flow to the exchange, and has com-pelled other exchanges to pursue technology innovations and structural reforms through either expansion or consolidation. T he financial industry has come to recognize the importance of deriv-ative securities in providing unique investment opportunities and risk-management vehicles. Trading volume on derivatives has increased tremendously during the past few years. Accompanying this expan-sion in derivatives have been rapid expansions and transformations in the stock options market. In the United States, in an effort to reduce trade-throughs and other market seg-mentations, a series of regulatory changes have taken place since the late 1990 s. In July 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a plan to electronically link the various market centers (the “Linkage Plan”). The SEC has also adopted more strin-gent quoting and disclosure rules on the options market. The “firm quote ” rule was applied to the options markets on April 1, 2001.

40|$|Currently IS {{practice}} abounds with application innovations, e. g. online auctions, blogs, wikis, chat, user spaces, multi-player {{games and}} reputation ratings, while {{over the same}} time few new IS academic theories have taken hold. To the practitioners who innovate, journals often seem out of date, over-rigorous and increasingly irrelevant. As IS practice innovates, IS theory seems to be if anything becoming more risk averse. If IS journals assume research rigor is research excellence, they will fall behind {{the cutting edge of}} IS progress. This would be unfortunate, as advances need to be driven by theory as well as practice. The key is recognition that good research involves two dimensions not one, namely rigor and relevance. These correspond to avoiding errors of commission (lack of rigor), and avoiding errors of omission (lack of relevance). These two dimensions suggest a selective but open IS electronic archive could increase both relevance (by electronically publishing all submissions) and rigor (by electronically supporting expert and Wiki style reviews).

This question just adopted immediate commercial, legal and political importance following U.

Giving academic researchers access to (so far prohibitively expensive) microsecond exchange data would help rectify this situation. As a by-product, the lessons learned would deepen understanding of instabilities across myriad other networks, e. g. impact of millisecond delays on brain function and safety of driverless vehicle navigation systems beyond human response times.

To reduce environmental impacts, ASPA visitors must comply with the Area's management plan and receive an entry permit from an appropriate national authority. Parties to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty are obliged to exchange information on: i) the number of permits allocated for the forthcoming season, and ii) the number of visits to ASPAs during the previous season. We assessed the effectiveness of current permitting and information exchange practices by examining ASPA visitation data supplied to the Antarctic Treaty <b>System's</b> <b>Electronic</b> Information <b>Exchange</b> <b>System</b> during 2008 / 09 – 2010 / 11.

Furthermore, some Parties did not fulfil their obligations under the Protocol by failing to provide full information on ASPA visitation. Estimations suggested that the level of ASPA visitation varied with ASPA location and the main value being protected. However, without full disclosure by Parties, ASPA visitation data is of limited use for informing general and ASPA-specific environmental management practices. Improved provision and formal interpretation of ASPA visitation data are recommended to enable more co-ordinated and effective management of activities within ASPAs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a historical}} case study of the payment system designed, built, and operated by Visa International Services Association (VISA, hereafter “Visa”). The system is analyzed as a sociotechnical one, consisting of both social and technical elements that mutually constitute and shape one another. The historical narrative concentrates on the period of 1970 to 1984, which roughly corresponds to the tenure of the system’s founder and first CEO, Dee Ward Hock. It also focuses primarily upon the events that took place within the United States. After establishing a theoretical and historical context, I describe why and how the organization now known as Visa was formed. I then explain how the founder and his staff transformed the disintegrated, paper-based credit card systems of the 1960 s into the unified, <b>electronic</b> value <b>exchange</b> <b>system</b> we know today. Special attention is paid throughout this narrative {{to the ways in}} which the technologies were shaped by political, legal, economic, and cultural forces, as well as the ways in which the system began to alter those social relations in return.

Using the above picture, we calculate and give physical interpretation of the finite-frequency finite-temperature current noise in a noninteracting Landauer-type system, where the chemical potentials of terminals 1 and 2 are µ + eV/ 2 and µ − eV/ 2 respectively, and derive a detailed-balance condition for this nonequilibrium system.

We analyze German stocks that are traded simultaneously at both exchanges using high frequency data for XETRA, the NYSE, and the foreign exchange rates. Converting Euro-prices into Dollar-prices reveals possibilities to explore the efficiency as well as arbitrage opportunities of these two stock markets using the phenomenon of stock price clustering. We see the result of differing extents of clustering on both exchanges, thus violating the no-arbitrage condition. We propose a trading strategy that exploits these differences. Furthermore, we compare our empirical findings with the results we obtain from simulating financial markets and conclude that simulations based on the no-arbitrage condition are not consistent with our empirical observations. financial markets, simulation, no-arbitrage condition, stochastic processes...|$|R
