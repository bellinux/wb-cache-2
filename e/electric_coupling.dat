He examined color-coding in the honey bee retina by marking individual cells with a fluorescent dye and recording from these cells as single units. From this analysis he determined {{that there are three}} types of receptors in the honey bee eye: 1) UV receptors, 2) blue receptors, and 3) green receptors The three receptors contain three rhodopsin-like pigments which have maximal absorbance at wavelengths of 350nm, 440nm, and 540nm. Menzel also found that most of the cells he studied had secondary sensitivities that corresponded to wavelength regions at which the other two receptor types were maximally active. He used spectral efficiency experiments to suggest that these secondary sensitivities result from <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> between the receptors.|$|E

The bandwidth enhancement is achieved using a modified <b>electric</b> <b>coupled</b> (MELC) resonator as the antenna's main radiating element. This modification is achieved using two strip lines placed below a conventional <b>electric</b> <b>coupled</b> (CELC) resonator. The measured impedance bandwidth at - 10 dB is 20. 7 % at a resonance frequency of 2. 62 GHz. The design is validated by experimental results, and the proposed antenna is suitable for worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax) applications (2. 5 - 2. 69 GHz) ...|$|R

50|$|As briefly {{mentioned}} above, {{naturally occurring}} {{materials such as}} conventional lenses and glass prisms are unable to significantly interact with the magnetic field of light. The significant interaction (permittivity) occurs with the electric field. In natural materials, any useful magnetic interaction will taper off in the gigahertz range of frequencies. Compared to interaction with the electric field, the magnetic component is imperceptible when in terahertz, infrared, and visible light. So, a notable step occurred with the invention of a practical metamaterial at microwave frequencies, because the rudimentary elements of metamaterials have demonstrated a coupling and inductive response to the magnetic component commensurate with the <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> and response. This demonstrated the occurrence of an artificial magnetism, and was later applied to terahertz and infrared electromagnetic wave (or light). In the terahertz and infrared domain, it is a response {{that has not been}} discovered in nature.|$|E
50|$|When M {{is greater}} than N+1 but less than 3N/2, the theory is {{asymptotically}} free. However at low energies the theory becomes strongly coupled, and is better described by a Seiberg dual description in terms of magnetic variables with the same global flavor symmetry group but a new gauge symmetry SU(M-N). Notice that the gauge group is not an observable, but simply reflects the redundancy or a description and so may well differ in various dual theories, {{as it does in}} this case. On the other hand, the global symmetry group is an observable so it is essential that it is the same, SU(M), in both descriptions. The dual magnetic theory is free in the infrared, the coupling constant shrinks logarithmically, and so by the Dirac quantization condition the <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> constant grows logarithmically in the infrared. This implies that the potential between two electric charges, at long distances, scales as the logarithm of their distance divided by the distance.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{transponder}}s. The first are the <b>electric</b> <b>coupled</b> transponder systems. <b>Electric</b> <b>coupled</b> transponder systems {{are not limited to}} small areas for transmission but can transmit messages or signals for different ranges of distance including several inches to miles, as used in satellites and airplanes. These systems require large amounts of constant electricity to operate. The second type, used by automobile manufacturers, are called magnetic coupled transponder systems. Magnetic coupled transponder systems are passive in nature. This means they do not require constant electricity and thus do not need a power source of their own. They operate in the frequency range area of 125 kHz. Since magnetic coupled transponders do not have their own power source, they are very limited in range of communication and generally operate in the range of 1 cm to 15 cm. Since this is a radio frequency, it can penetrate materials that would make the transponder not directly visible, such as the plastic or rubber in the bow of a key.|$|R

30|$|In principle, nanoresonators may {{couple to}} {{electromagnetic}} fields by the charge distributions (<b>electric</b> <b>coupling)</b> {{or by the}} magnetic moment they carry (magnetic coupling). Traditionally, the energy transfer via <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> has received more attention since materials are mostly transparent to the magnetic field. Also, magnetic field intensity in electromagnetic radiations is significantly smaller than the electric field. Consequently, magnetic coupling of mechanical resonators with electromagnetic radiations becomes impractical unless {{the size of the}} system significantly decreases. A desirable magnetic coupling, however, can be achieved if the coupling occurs within the near-field range [4]. Take the example of a mechanical nanoresonator operating in a biological environment. In this case, magnetic coupling holds important advantages over <b>electric</b> <b>coupling.</b> First, magnetically coupled systems can provide more selective and localized energy transfer that {{is due to the fact}} that magnetic fields, unlike electric fields, couple weakly with non-targeted surrounding media, which are often not magnetic [5, 6]. Therefore, magnetic signals suffer from considerably less attenuations while propagating in the surrounding biological media and can drive a targeted resonator inaccessible to electric signals with the same level of energy. In addition, magnetic dipoles are normally more stable than electric dipoles and do not require significant energy from outside to maintain their state.|$|E

Scanning SQUID can also measure a sample's magnetic response to an applied current (dΦ/dI) or voltage (dΦ/dV) using standard lock-in techniques.

The <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> artifact results in dΦ/dV and dΦ/dI images which mimic the spatial variation of the static magnetic fields from the sample (e. g. ferromagnetic domains).

40|$|The {{background}} {{to this study}} {{is an effort to}} exploit a magneto-inductive waveguide (MIW) for near-field contactless data and power transfer applications. MIWs are almost purely magnetically coupled metamaterial waveguides whose coupling strengths can never exceed the limit of conservation of magnetic flux. This study raises the hypothesis that the coupling strength limit of MIWs can be overcome by incorporating additional <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> into the structures; therefore, more strongly coupled metamaterial waveguides can be built and serve as contactless near-field communication channels with wider passbands and lower attenuations. The hypothesis was tested in this study by investigating a new variant of the metamaterial waveguide: the Capacitor-Connected Grid (CCG), in which additional <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> is introduced by connecting coupling capacitors over inter-element gaps between conventional MIW metallic loop resonators. The study investigates the dispersion and attenuation characteristics of both one- (1 -D) and two-dimensional (2 -D) CCG devices, leading to a discussion on their potential uses in ultra- wideband (UWB) contactless near-field data transfer applications. A mixed coupling model calculating inter-element mixed coupling coefficients for arbitrarily configured CCG waveguides is derived based on the state-of-the-art, taking into account the shift of resonant frequency caused by <b>electric</b> <b>coupling.</b> The study also looks at terminal optimizations for 1 -D CCG with a view to maximizing power transfer efficiency. A highlight {{of this study is that}} a 1 -D CCG demonstration device in theory should be able to achieve 192. 4 % fractional bandwidth, which exceeds the 20 % requirement of a UWB channel by a factor of 9. 6, and is only 1 / 10 of the minimum attenuation of an equivalent-sized MIW device. Similar communication characteristics have also been found at selected transmission paths on a 2 -D CCG demonstration structure. The results of this study on CCG waveguides verify the hypothesis that incorporating additional <b>electric</b> <b>coupling</b> into an almost purely magnetically coupled waveguide can improve its coupling strength and thereby achieve a communication channel with larger bandwidths and lower losses. </p...|$|E
