40|$|Abstract. We {{establish}} a weak form of Carlson’s conjecture on {{the depth of}} the mod-p cohomology ring of a p-group. In particular, Duflot’s lower bound for the depth is tight if and only if the cohomology ring is not detected on a certain family of subgroups. The proofs use the structure of the cohomology ring as a comodule over the cohomology of the centre via the multiplication map. We demonstrate the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> parameters (so-called polarised systems) which are particularly well adapted to this comodule structure...|$|R

This Theorem provides a flexible framework for proving the boundedness of a Calderón-Zygmund operator, supposing the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> local accretive functions. We assume that the integrability exponents on these <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> functions are of the form 1 /p+ 1 /q< 1, and provide a direct proof.

40|$|We demonstrate, {{using the}} {{symbolic}} method together with p-adic and resultant methods, the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> with exactly {{one or two}} generalized symmetries. Since the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> one or two symmetries is often taken as a sure sign (or as the definition) of integrability, that is, the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> symmetries on infinitely many orders, this shows that such practice is devoid of any mathematical foundation. Extensive computations show that systems with one symmetry are rather common, and with two symmetries are fairly rare, at least within the class we have been considering in this paper. ...|$|R

First, we classify all Bol loops of exponent 2 of order 16; second, we classify all (left) Bol loops of exponent 2 whose right nucleus has index 2. In particular, we give a class of examples of non-nilpotent such Bol loops...|$|R
