This was confirmed by the selective modification of histidine residues using <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> which was found to block both benzodiazepine and β-carboline binding. In order to assess whether this histidine residue is located in or adjacent to the benzodiazepine and β-carboline binding sites, experiments were performed using either benzodiazepine or β-carboline to protect against <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> treatment. It was found that benzodiazepine agonists, but not propyl β-carboline protect the benzodiazepine binding sites from <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> modification...|$|E

In {{an effort to find}} evidence for Hoogsteen base-pairing at quinoxaline-binding sites in solution, chemical "footprinting" (differential cleavage reactivity) of echinomycin bound to DNA restriction fragments was examined. We report that purines (A greater than G) in the first and/or fourth base-pair positions of occupied echinomycin-binding sites are hyperreactive to <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> The correspondence of the solid-state data and the sites of <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> hyperreactivity suggests that <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> may be a sensitive reagent for the detection of Hoogsteen base-pairing in solution. Moreover, a 12 -base-pair segment of alternating A-T DNA, which is 6 base pairs away from the nearest strong echinomycin-binding site, is also hyperreactive to <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> in the presence of echinomycin. This hyperreactive segment may be an altered form of right-handed DNA that is entirely Hoogsteen base-paired...|$|E

It was found that 0. 86 +/- 0. 07 histidine residue per subunit reacted with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> in thiomethylated lactate dehydrogenase. This reaction was not affected in the enzyme-NADH binary complex, but was diminished in the enzyme-NADH-oxamate ternary complex. In the enzyme-NADH complex the reaction of <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> was controlled by two groups with pKa 6. 8 and 7. 9. The decreased reactivity of histidine- 195 was selective in thiomethylated lactate dehydrogenase, since the reactivity of arginine and/or lysine residues was enhanced...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> {{modification}} of histidine {{on the specific}} binding of [3 H]diazepam and its enhancement with muscimol and (+/-) -pentobarbital was investigated. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> treatment produced a dose-related inhibition of specific [3 H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes with a maximal inhibition of approximately 40 % at 1 mM. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate,</b> while having {{no effect on the}} affinity (Kd), decreased the binding capacity (Bmax) of diazepam from a control value of 1543 +/- 116 fmol/mg of protein to 789 +/- 79 fmol/mg of protein (mean +/- SD; P less than 0. 005; n = 4). Under conditions in which approximately 40 % of the diazepam binding sites were modified by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> treatment, the ability of muscimol and pentobarbital to enhance diazepam binding was not altered. These results suggest that a histidine residue is critical for a part (approximately 40 %) of the benzodiazepine binding sites and that there may exist a heterogeneity of benzodiazepine binding sites. Furthermore, these results indicate that perhaps only a portion of the benzodiazepine binding sites are functionally coupled to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-ionophore complex...|$|E
40|$|Two {{palindromic}} DNA sequences {{were analyzed}} {{with respect to}} their chemical reactivities with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> In negatively supercoiled plasmid templates enhanced N 7 carbethoxylation was found with individual purines located in presumptive single-stranded loops of DNA cruciform structures. No enhanced reactivity at these positions was observed in linear, relaxed or low superhelical density plasmids. Hyperreactivity was found over a narrow region only, indicating that stable cruciforms contain loops of minimal size. No enhanced chemical reactivity was found with the four-way junction at the base of cruciforms. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> has proved a sensitive structural probe for the analysis, with single nucleotide resolution, of DNA cruciform structures...|$|E

The pentaco-ordinate nature of the binding of triethyltin to cat haemoglobin is confirmed by the inability of intramolecularly pentaco-ordinate tin compounds to compete. Consideration of the symmetry of the haemoglobin molecule {{in the light of the}} above results suggests that a unique arrangement of histidine and cysteine residues is required for the binding of triethyltin.

40|$|The {{inactivation}} of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus at pH 6 by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> parallelled the N-ethoxyformylation of {{a single}} histidine residue in the enzyme. The inactivation arose from {{a decrease in the}} maximum velocity of the enzymic reaction with no effect on the Km value. The inactivation did not apparently alter the ability of the enzyme to bind to a substrate-based affinity gel. The native enzyme contained only one reactive histidine residue. Removal of the two zinc atoms from the enzyme increased the number of reactive histidine residues to five, whereas in the totally denatured enzyme nearly eight such residues were available for reaction with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> The enzyme thus appears to contain one histidine residue that is essential for catalytic activity and four that may be involved in co-ordinating the zinc atoms in the structure...|$|E

The role of H 141 has been probed by mutagenesis, chemical modulation, and X-ray diffraction. The hyper-reactivity of H 141 towards <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> can be explained by its proximity to E 277. A proton shuttling role for H 141 is Supported by its conformational mobility observed among the known arginase structures. H 141 is proposed to serve as an acid/base catalyst, deprotonating the metal-bridging water molecule to generate the metal-bridging hydroxide nucleophile, and by protonating the amino group of the product to facilitate its departure.

40|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> inactivated D-xylose isomerases from Streptomyces violaceoruber, Streptomyces sp., Lactobacillus xylosus and Lactobacillus brevis with second-order rate {{constants}} of 422, 417, 99 and 92 M- 1. min- 1 respectively (at pH 6. 0 and 25 degrees C). Activity {{was completely}} restored {{by the addition}} of neutral hydroxylamine, and total protection was afforded by the substrate analogue xylitol in the presence of either Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + according to the genus studied. The difference spectra of the modified enzymes revealed an absorption maximum at 237 - 242 nm, characteristic for N-ethoxycarbonylhistidine. In addition, the spectrum of ethoxycarbonylated D-xylose isomerase from L. xylosus showed absorption minima at both 280 and 230 nm, indicative for modification of tyrosine residues. Nitration with tetranitromethane followed by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> treatment eliminated the possibility that modification of tyrosine residues was responsible for inactivation, and resulted in modification of one non-essential tyrosine residue and six histidine residues. Inactivation of the other D-xylose isomerases with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> required the modification of one (L. brevis), two (Streptomyces sp.) and four (S. violaceoruber) histidine residues per monomer. Spectral analysis and maintenance of total enzyme activities further indicated that either xylitol Mg 2 + (streptomycetes) or xylitol Mn 2 + (lactobacilli) prevented the modification of one crucial histidine residue. The overall results thus provide evidence that a single active-site histidine residue is involved in the catalytic reaction mechanism of D-xylose isomerases...|$|E

40|$|Purine {{residues}} {{located within}} regions of DNA {{that have the}} potential to form left-handed Z-helical structures are modified preferentially by diethyl pyrocarbonate; this hyperreactivity is dependent on the degree of negative superhelicity of the circular DNA molecules. As negative superhelical density increases, guanosines in a 32 -base-pair alternating G-C sequence and adenosines (but not guanosines) in a 64 -base-pair alternating A-C/G-T sequence become 5 - to 10 -fold more reactive to <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> The negative superhelical densities at which enhanced reactivity occurs are similar to those reported for the point at which left-handed helices form within plasmids carrying these DNA sequences. Probing of negatively supercoiled pBR 322 with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> reveals a hyperreactive region 31 base pairs in length of which only 9 base pairs are a perfect alternating purine and pyrimidine sequence; the reactivity of purines within this sequence indicates that purines in the anti conformation, or guanosines in the syn conformation with neighboring 3 ' thymidines, are not hyperreactive in the Z-DNA form...|$|E

Three histidine residues per enzyme subunit are modified by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> Kinetic and statistical analyses of the residual enzymic activity, {{as well as the}} number of modified histidine residues, indicate that, among the three modifiable residues, only one is essential for enzyme activity. The reactivity of this histidine residue exceeded 10 -fold the reactivity of the other two residues. Uridine, though at high concentration, protects the enzyme against inactivation and the very reactive histidine residue against modification. Thus it may be concluded that uridine phosphorylase contains only one histidine residue in each of its six subunits that is essential for enzyme activity...|$|E
40|$|Reaction {{of either}} native or carboxymethylated bovine and human α-lactalbumins with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> at pH 6. 1 {{results in the}} ethoxyformylation of up to two {{histidine}} residues in the bovine and one histidine residue in the human protein. At low concentrations (1 mg/mL) of bovine α-lactalbumin, modification of up to one histidine residue per molecule did not affect biological activity; however, modification of a second residue resulted in complete loss of activity. At higher concentrations (46 mg/mL), modification of a single histidine residue resulted in complete loss of activity. Carboxymethylated bovine α-lactalbumin, containing primarily 1, 3 -dicarboxymethylhistidine- 68 and 3 -carboxymethylhistidine- 32, was found to incorporate one ethoxyformyl group per molecule on reaction with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate,</b> and the modified derivative was totally inactivated. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that only histidine- 32 was ethoxyformylated under conditions in which the biological activity of either native or carboxymethylated bovine α-lactalbumin was lost. Ultraviolet and circular dichroic difference spectra of either native or carboxymethylated bovine α-lactalbumin indicated that ethoxyformylation produced no gross conformational changes. Specificity studies with model compounds including histidine and its N-methyl and Ncarboxymethyl derivatives indicated that the N(1) nitrogen of the imidazole group is specifically ethoxyformylated by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> These studies, in conjunction with those on α-lactalbumin and its carboxymethyl derivatives, suggest that the N(l) nitrogen of the imidazole group of histidine- 32 in bovine α-lactalbumin is intimately involved in the interaction of α-lactalbumin with UDP-galactose N-acetylglucosamine β 1 → 4 -galactosyltransferase {{in the formation of}} lactose synthase. © 1979 American Chemical Society.

The {{plot of the}} observed pseudo-first-order rate constant versus <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> concentration {{in the range of}} 0. 17 - 1. 7 mM was linear and went through the origin with a second-order rate constant of 1. 45 +/- 0. 1 M- 1. s- 1. The double-logarithmic plot was also linear, with slope of 1. 13, which suggested a 1 : 1 stoichiometry for the reaction between <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> and delta-crystallin. L-Arginine, L-norvaline or L-citrulline protected the argininosuccinate lyase {{activity of}} delta-crystallin from <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> inactivation. The dissociation constants for the delta-crystallin-L-arginine and delta-crystallin-L-citrulline binary complexes, determined by the protection experiments, were 4. 2 +/- 0. 2 and 0. 12 +/- 0. 04 mM respectively. Fumarate alone had no protective effect. However, fumarate plus L-arginine gave synergistic protection with a ligand binding interacting factor of 0. 12 +/- 0. 02. The double-protection data conformed to a random Uni Bi kinetic mechanism. Fluorescence-quenching studies indicated that the modified delta-crystallin had minimum, if any, conformational changes as compared with the native delta-crystallin. Inactivation of the enzyme activity was accompanied by an increasing absorbance at 240 nm of the protein. The absorption near 280 nm did not change. Treatment of the modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the enzyme activity to the original level. These results strongly indicated the modification of an essential histidine residue. Calculation from the 240 nm absorption changes indicated that only one histidine residue per subunit was modified by the reagent. This super-active histidine residue has a pKa value of approximately 6. 8 and acts as a general acid-base catalyst in the enzyme reaction mechanism. Our experimental data are compatible with an E 1 cB mechanism [Raushel (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 232, 520 - 525] for the argininosuccinate lyase with the essential histidine residue close to the arginine-binding domain of delta-crystallin.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the internal pH-sensitivity of heterologously expressed hSlo 1 BK channels. In the virtual absence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + {{to isolate the}} voltage-dependent gating transitions, low internal pH enhanced macroscopic hSlo 1 currents by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative voltages. The activation time course was faster and the deactivation time course was slower with low pH. The estimated Kd value of the stimulatory effect was approximately pH = 6. 5 or 0. 35 μM. The stimulatory effect was maintained when the auxiliary subunit mouse β 1 was coexpressed. Treatment of the hSlo 1 channel with the histidine modifying agent <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> also enhanced the hSlo 1 currents and greatly diminished the internal pH sensitivity, suggesting that <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> and low pH may work on the same effector mechanism. High concentrations of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + also masked the stimulatory effect of low internal pH.

The presence of Mg 2 + prevented the inactivation. Enzyme inactivated with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> was re-activated by hydroxylamine. The inactivation parallelled the amount of modified histidine residue, and a plot of the activity remaining against the amount of modified histidine residue suggested that the modification of one of two histidine residues totally inactivated the enzyme.

Amino acid analysis and sequence analysis of the peptide revealed that it comprised residues 96 - 119 of the inorganic pyrophosphatase from thermophilic bacterium PS- 3. These results, when compared with those reported for the Escherichia coli and yeast enzymes, imply that His- 118 of the inorganic pyrophosphatase from thermophilic bacterium PS- 3 is located near the Mg(2 +) -binding site and thus affects the binding of Mg 2 +...|$|E

Differential peptide mapping between D-xylose isomerase, which has previously been treated with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> in {{the presence or absence}} of xylitol plus Mg 2 +, allowed specific isolation and sequencing of a peptide containing this active-site histidine.

It allowed us to locate the single active-site histidine at position 54 in the primary structure of Streptomyces violaceoruber D-xylose isomerase.

To determine {{the location of the}} Zn 2 + binding site in calreticulin different domains of the protein were expressed in E. coli, using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein system, and their Zn 2 +-dependent interaction with Zn 2 +-IDA-agarose were determined. Three distinct domains were used in this study: the N + P-domain (the first 290 residues); the N-domain (residues 1 – 182) and the proline-rich P-domain (residues 180 – 273). The N + P-domain bound to the Zn 2 +-IDA-agarose and were eluted with an increasing concentration of imidazole. The N-domain also bound 65 Zn 2 + as measured by the overlay method. The P-domain did not interact with the Zn 2 +-IDA-agarose and it did not bind any detectable amount of Zn 2 +. Chemical modification of calreticulin with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> indicated that five out of seven histidines were protected in the presence of Zn 2 + but they were modified by <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> in the absence of Zn 2 + suggesting that these residues may be involved in Zn 2 + binding to calreticulin.

Mitochondria were incubated with 3 microM hematoporphyrin and irradiated at 365 nm with a fluence rate of 25 watts/m 2. For short durations of irradiation (60 s) the adenine nucleotide translocase was inactivated, but mitochondria retained their ability to form a proton electrochemical gradient and accumulated Ca 2 + and Pi {{at the same rate}} as non-irradiated controls. Strikingly, however, the oxidative effects of photodynamic action prevented opening of the PT pore which is normally induced by Ca 2 + plus Pi or by treatment with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> (a histidine reagent) or diamide (a thiol oxidant). We show that the most likely targets for photodynamic action are critical histidines that undergo degradation.

(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16638 - 16642). These data suggest (i) that the dithiol cysteines are not oxidized by photodynamic action, but rather became inaccessible to oxidants; and (ii) that irradiation of hematoporphyrin-loaded mitochondria does not lead to pore denaturation, but rather to site-selective inactivation of discrete pore functional domains...|$|E

These transport components, called high affinity and low affinity transport could also be distinguished on the basis of their apparent substrate saturability and their sensitivity to media pH. The apparent Km for high affinity transport was 30 micromolar. The Km for low affinity transport was not determined. To test whether these transport components could also be distinguished on the basis of inhibitor sensitivity and to assess the value of inhibitors for distinguishing multiple aspartate translocators, a survey of several classes of potential inhibitors was conducted.

Specificity for single-stranded loop regions is apparent from the similarity of the reactivity of OP-Cu to the single-strand specific reagents dimethyl sulfate and <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> using the fragment of lac mRNA as a substrate. Similar preference is observed in the reaction with tRNA although scission in the helical acceptor stem is also observed...|$|E
40|$|The pyrimidine/purine-biased region located {{upstream}} of the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor {{gene transcription}} initiation sites was sensitive to S 1 nuclease when under superhelical tension. The structural {{basis of this}} specific reactivity to S 1 nuclease was probed {{by the use of}} <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> The patterns of modification suggested that the H-form proposed by Mirkin, Lyamichev, Drushlyak, Dobrynin, Filippov & Frank-Kamenetskii [Nature (London) (1987) 330, 495 - 497], which includes an intramolecular triplex and a single-stranded region, was the most plausible model for the sequence tested. The results of dimethyl sulphate modification also supported this model...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBinding of the bis-intercalators echinomycin and N,N′-di(9 -acridinyl) spermidine or the mono-intercalators 9 -aminoacridine and ethidium to DNA induces {{hypersensitivity}} of adenines towards reaction with <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate.</b> It {{is proposed}} that this hyperreactivity {{is due to}} the DNA helix unwinding and extension induced by intercalation, thereby exposing N 7 in the major groove, and not as previously suggested to the formation of Hoogsteen base pairing. Hypersensitivity of thymines towards oxidation with permanganate is also induced upon binding of these drugs (especially the bis-intercalators) to DNA. This thymine hyperreactivity is both sequence- and intercalator-dependent, thereby indicating the potential of KMnO 4 as a useful probe for analysing the structure of intercalator-DNA complexes in solution...|$|E
40|$|Three {{chemical}} reactions can probe the secondary and tertiary interactions of RNA molecules in solution. Dimethyl sulfate monitors the N- 7 of guanosines and senses tertiary interactions there, <b>diethyl</b> <b>pyrocarbonate</b> detects stacking of adenosines, and an alternate dimethyl sulfate reaction examines the N- 3 of cytidines and thus probes base pairing. The reactions work between 0 degrees C and 90 degrees C and at pH 4. 5 [...] 8. 5 {{in a variety}} of buffers. As an example we follow the progressive denaturation of yeast tRNAPhe terminally labeled with 32 P as the tertiary and secondary structures sequentially melt out. A single autoradiograph of a terminally labeled molecule locates regions of higher-order structure and identifies the bases involved...|$|E
