The aircraft is equipped with AMAGB gearbox, which is designed and produced by CVRDE. The castings are made of magnesium alloy and the gearbox has its own self-contained lubrication system. AMAGB operates in two modes. In the starter mode, it aids in starting the engine through jet fuel starter.

Hamilton Sundstrand has several different deaerator models, but has been unable to evaluate the efficiency of oil separation for different designs. Our goal is to evaluate the efficiency of two deaerator models. The evaluation will be based on experimental and theoretical data. The experimental data will be collected using an actual deaerator setup. The theoretical data will be collected using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software models.

In this paper, we present a hybrid phase-domain model for the aircraft generator that accurately represents both nominal and parametric faulty behaviors. We present the details of the hybrid modeling approach and simulation results of nominal operation and fault behaviors associated with parametric faults in the aircraft generator.

40|$|Health {{condition}} monitoring, {{commonly referred}} as Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) for fleets or vehicles, studies {{the current and}} future health state of a system. Health monitoring techniques based on data driven approaches have proven successful in several areas and are easily scalable; however they do not rely on the understating of the physics of failure; whereas Physics-based Model (PbM) approaches require expert knowledge of the failure modes and {{are based on the}} understanding of the component behaviour and degradation mechanisms. The development of IVHM is particularly challenging for legacy aircraft due to the restrictive regulations of the aerospace industry. This thesis proposes a novel PbM technique to detect metal-metal contact in hydrodynamic bearings. The planetary transmission of an aircraft’s <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> <b>Generator</b> (IDG) is used as a case study. Research on the detection of metal-metal contact in hydrodynamic bearings has focused on data driven approaches using vibration or acoustic emissions rather than on PbMs. The proposed technique estimates metal-metal contact by modelling the physical phenomena involved in the failure mechanism and only the speed, load and temperature are required as inputs, all of them available in the IDG and not requiring any additional sensors. The study of metal-metal in hydrodynamic bearings in the field of tribology has focused on mixed lubrication models of the whole bearing, or computational models accounting for local effect under the hydrodynamic lubrication region. In addition to the IVHM technique, this thesis contributes to the field of tribology by proposing a computational mixed lubrication model capable of studying metal-metal contact locally along the lubricated surface of the bearing. Experimental results of a plain journal bearing have been used to validate the PbM and a replica of the transmission of the IDG has been tested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed technique at detecting metal-metal contact...|$|E

The <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> <b>Generator</b> (IDG), which generates electric power for the jet plane, needs to be cooled all the time in order to have maximum efficiency. To have effective heat transfer between the IDG and Mobil jet lubricating oil, the oil should be of high quality. Due to the simultaneous operation of vacuum and high pressure pumps in the engine lube system, air is entrapped into the oil and carried through the IDG and hence, decreases the heat transfer between the parts of the IDG and the lubricating oil. In order to resolve this problem, the Deaerator is used in the IDG, to remove the entrapped air from the oil by utilizing the basic centrifugal principle. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of the different deaerator designs including the basic 75 / 90 GENERIC design, by conducting experiments and CFD simulations. The deaerator testing methodology has been modified based on the overall mass balance of air inlet and outlet sections of the deaerator. The deaerator test rig is modified with number of additional temperature sensors, air volume flow meters, pressure transducers and NI Lab VIEW Data Acquisition System. The deaerator has been tested for different operating conditions and all the tests have been repeated to observe the precision and statistical reliability of the data. The reversing test trials have been done to see the effect of Hysteresis in test trials. In addition to that, the high temperature test trials have been done at 150 °F and 200 °F to observe the effect of temperature on the deaerator performance. The overall performance of the deaerator for different test trials has been presented in the thesis. In order to comprehend the flow dynamic, air separation process and the effect of inner geometry on the performance of the deaerator, a three-dimensional computational model has been created and simulations were performed in ANSYS CFX. The model involving two-phase turbulent and rotating flow analysis has been performed.

This Dark Cockpit immediately confirms to the crew that the panels are correctly configured and that no abnormalities are present. Primary systems annunciations are shown in text on the Alert Area of the Engine and Alert Display (EAD). This eliminates the need to scan the overhead. The MD- 11 aircraft systems can be manually controlled from the overhead area of the cockpit. The center portion of the overhead panel is composed of the primary aircraft systems panels, which include FUEL, AIR, Electrical (ELEC) and Hydraulic (HYD) systems, which are easily accessible from both flight crew positions. Each Aircraft Systems Controller (ASC) has two automatic channels and a manual mode. All rectangular lights are annunciators. All square lights are combined switches and annunciators called switch/lights. Red switch/lights on the overhead (Level 3 alerts) are for conditions requiring immediate crew action. Amber (Level 2 or Level 1 alerts) indicates a fault or switch out of position requiring awareness or crew interaction. Overhead switches used in normal operating conditions will illuminate blue when in use (Level 0 alerts) such as WING ANTI-ICE - ON. An overhead switch/light with BLACK LETTERING on an amber or red background indicates a system failure and that crew interaction is required.
