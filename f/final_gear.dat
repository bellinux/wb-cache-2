2500|$|TRD Griffon Concept is {{a version}} of GT86 {{designed}} specifically for track driving, created by Toyota Racing Development. Changes include bonnet, roof, doors, boot lid and rear wings made from lightweight carbon fibre; carbonfibre reinforced plastic bumpers, wider front wings and rear diffuser; windows made from polycarbonate material, TRD driver's bucket seat, gear shift knob, ignition button and oil pressure and water temperature gauges; Momo steering wheel, Takata seatbelts, a TRD mechanical LSD replacing standard Torsen limited-slip differential, coil over suspension kit, <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio shortened to 4.8:1, an oil cooler for the engine, a TRD mono block brake calliper kit with racing spec brake pads, TWS 18-inch wheels with Yokohama Advan tyres, stock Toyota GT86 engine.

2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded differential, where the side gears are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the Torsen or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio {{depending on the type of}} track layout.|$|E
50|$|Enthusiasts {{soon found}} the <b>final</b> <b>gearing</b> too tall, and the {{intake and exhaust}} restrictive. If you changed those, you had a fast bike.|$|R

50|$|Power {{from the}} engine is {{transmitted}} in a conventional manner through the lightweight flywheel, clutch, and Corvette type four-speed transmission. Attaching directly to the rear end of the transmission case is the differential and <b>final</b> drive <b>gear</b> mechanism. A feature of the <b>final</b> drive <b>gears</b> {{is the ability to}} quickly change ratios so that vehicle performance can be as quickly tailored to a new environment. Power transmission to the wheels is completed through individual axle shafts with universal joints on each end, or a total of four in-all.|$|R

5000|$|The 1.6 DOHC {{versions}} were {{equipped with}} D16 long ratio transmissions {{which had a}} slightly bigger <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio compared to the D16 short ratio found on the other versions with the less power engines.|$|E
50|$|The early R Type Continental has {{essentially}} the same engine as the standard R Type, but with modified carburation, induction and exhaust manifolds along with higher gear ratios. The compression ratio was raised to 7.25:1 from the standard 6.75:1, while the <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio was raised (lowered numerically) from 3.41 to 3.07.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{propulsion}} systems, mechanical, Diesel-electric or hydrostatic driven were available. The mechanically driven car employs {{the use of}} engine, transmission, <b>final</b> drive <b>gear</b> box with sprockets and chains to deliver power to the driving wheels. Cars equipped with electric propulsion have an engine which turns a generator for providing electricity for the traction motors. Hydrostatic propulsion employs the use of diesel engine to power a hydraulic pump which supplies pressurized fluid to two 100 H.P. hydraulic motors on the front truck, {{in place of the}} <b>final</b> drive <b>gear</b> box as per the mechanical set-up for the standard Model-20.|$|R
5000|$|The 1980 Pantah 500SL had a {{plain bearing}} {{crankshaft}} {{and the same}} bore and stroke as the old 500 racer, 74 mm x 58 mm, but the head had a 60 degree included valve angle. The engines were noticeably lacking in bottom-end and mid-range torque, but theyrevved freely enough. The suspension seemed less precise than earlier Ducati models, and the 35 mm front forks lacked rigidity. Some riders found the <b>final</b> <b>gearing</b> too tall, and the intake and exhaust restrictive; [...] but when these were changed for higher flow items with lowered gearing, it gave a performance increase.|$|R
5000|$|GMC {{created an}} upscale {{version of its}} Sierra 1500 in 2000 called the Sierra C3. It used all-wheel drive with a 3.73 <b>final</b> drive <b>gear</b> ratio and {{included}} the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at [...] at 5000 rpm and 370 lb•ft (502 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L60E-HD four speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment. For 2002, the name was changed to Sierra Denali, but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E-HD to the 4L65E {{in conjunction with a}} 4.10 <b>final</b> drive <b>gear</b> ratio.|$|R
50|$|In a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only {{on the number of}} teeth on the first and last gear.

However, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the <b>final</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... † - #4 PK Carsport and #7 All-Inkl.com Racing entries {{were both}} disqualified for failing post-race inspection. The #4 PK Carsport entry was the race winner prior to disqualification, {{but had a}} fuel tank 1.3 liters larger than the legal limit. The #7 All-Inkl.com Racing entry had a gearbox <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio that was not {{approved}} by the FIA.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} gearboxes for ST185 GT-Four. The E150F with 4.285 <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio {{was installed in}} the Japanese market and All-Trac. European and Australian specs come with E151F with 3.933 ratio. The Japanese market only GT-Four Rally has E152F with close ratio on the 1st through 4th gear and 4.285 final ratio. All the RC/Carlos Sainz/Group A Rallye have E151F.|$|E

50|$|In July 1979 the car {{underwent}} another styling modification, receiving {{large black}} plastic cladding on the rear, surrounding new taillights, and new side trim and bumpers. The grille was also new, {{and there was}} black plastic wheelarches to link all of the plastic parts together. The extractor vents behind the rear side windows were also larger, of black plastic, and wrapped around the pillar. In terms of transmissions, a five-speed transmission now became available on certain models. The fifth gear was an overgear, while the ratios of the four lower speeds and the <b>final</b> <b>gearing</b> remained unchanged. The front turn signals were moved {{from the front of}} the fenders to a spot just in front of the leading edge of the doors, while a small badge denoting the trim level appeared in the turn signal's old place.|$|R
50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the <b>final</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{third gear}} {{in the picture}} has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and third gear is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> ratio is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} McLaren F1 has a transverse 6-speed {{manual gearbox}} with an AP carbon triple-plate clutch contained in an aluminium housing. The second generation GTR edition has a magnesium housing. Both the standard edition and the 'McLaren F1 LM' have the following gear ratios: 3.23:1, 2.19:1, 1.71:1, 1.39:1, 1.16:1, 0.93:1, {{with a final}} drive of 2.37:1, the <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> is offset {{from the side of}} the clutch.

5000|$|Prior {{to each of}} {{the five}} jumps, {{students}} in the AM-490 class receive two gear inspections to ensure their parachutes are fitted and working properly. These thorough inspections guarantee that the parachute's main and reserve canopy firing devices are on and accurately calibrated, and their gear is not defective. Students also receive a comprehensive briefing from the jumpmaster before loading the aircraft. Once airborne, the jumpmaster determines the exit/opening point, which varies with the day's wind patterns, student's receive their third and <b>final</b> <b>gear</b> inspection as the plane turns inbound for the jump run.

5000|$|It {{includes}} an integrated swingarm, which houses a centrifugally controlled Continuously variable transmission (CVT) using a rubber belt sometimes called a VDP. At {{the rear of}} the swingarm, a centrifugal clutch connects the transmission to a simple integral gear-reduction unit. There is no clutch of any kind between the CVT and the crankshaft; it is engaged via a centrifugal clutch at the rear pulley in the same fashion as Vespa Grande, Bravo and variated Ciao model, as well as Honda Camino/Hobbit scooters/mopeds. An electric starter, backup kick-starter, and rear brake hardware is also housed in the swingarm. There are variants known as the [...] "short case" [...] (10" [...] rear wheel, 729, 735 or 742mm belt) and [...] "long case" [...] (12" [...] or 13" [...] wheel, 835 or 842mm belt). <b>Final</b> <b>gearing</b> ratio can be as low as 13/40, or as high as 18/36 (more commonly available as aftermarket items).|$|R
