40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{principles}} of <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and examines the concept of <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{as an extension of}} knowledge management. Potential application of <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in the hospitality and tourism market space is also examined, with emphasis on the value that use of such technology may have to small and medium sized operators in the industry. Theoretical concepts regarding the technical aspects of <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are presented {{in the context of their}} functionality rather than from the perspective of detailed technological theory of operation. Application and applicability of the technology to business operations is of greater interest here than the detail of software and hardware attributes of systems. The advent of technological solutions such as <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> has ramifications for both policy makers and practitioners in the SME arena. Exploration of the application of the technology in the tourism and hospitality industries is of particular interest, with input being provided by executives and senior ITC personnel engaged within the relevant industries. Of special interest is the suitability of the technology for use by members of the tourism and hospitality industries at the smaller end of the size continuum who may not have the same level of access to industry data and information and may be therefore disadvantaged in their operations. Whilst largely conceptual in its content, the paper presents preliminary results from qualitative research and interaction with industry members in Western Australia. The isolation of businesses operating in Western Australia is seen as a disadvantage in terms of maintaining currency of industry data and information, with <b>digital</b> <b>ecosystems</b> being presented as a potential enabler and facilitator of success for smaller participants in tourism and hospitality...|$|R

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> {{is defined}} as ldquoan open, loosely coupled, domain clustered, demand-driven, {{self-organizing}} and agent-based environment, in which each species is proactive and responsive for its own benefit and profitrdquo [1]. Species in the <b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> can play dual roles, which are service requester (client) service provider (server). A service provider enters the <b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> by publishing a service metadata in the service factory, in which the service metadata can be clustered by domain-specific ontologies provided by the <b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem.</b> Two issues emerge here. First of all, vast and heterogeneous service metadata are ubiquitous before the <b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> technology emerges. It is a challenge for the <b>Digital</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> to organize these metadata. In order to solve this issue, an automatic service metadata clustering approach could be desired. However, this could educe the second issue - the automatic association between service concepts and service metadata could not agree with service providerspsila perceptions, {{as a result of}} the differences among individual understandings. To solve the two issues, in this paper, we present a hybrid ontology-based metadata clustering methodology comprising an extended case-based reasoning algorithm-based automatic concept-metadata association approach and a service provider-oriented concept-metadata association approach...|$|E
