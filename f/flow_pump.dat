50|$|The HeartAssist5 is an axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> and the {{smallest}} of the full-flow LVADs. Its pump is slightly larger in diameter than a U.S. quarter or one-Euro coin and weighs only 3.2 ounces (92 grams). The small size allows for the device to be implanted adjacent to the heart and above the diaphragm; this is unique among LVADs.|$|E
50|$|A pump-jet, hydrojet, {{or water}} jet is a marine system {{that creates a}} jet of water for propulsion. The {{mechanical}} arrangement may be a ducted propeller (axial-flow pump), a centrifugal pump, or a mixed <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> which {{is a combination of}} both centrifugal and axial designs. The design also incorporates an intake to provide water to the pump and a nozzle to direct the flow of water out of the pump.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, he {{performed}} the first implant {{of one of}} these devices in a human; this device has become the most widely used implantable LVAD in the world. Frazier's seminal work in the field of left ventricular assist devices continued with experimental studies that resulted in the first intravascular, implantable continuous <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> (Hemopump), which he first implanted in a human in April 1988. In 1991, one of Frazier's patients was the first to be discharged home with an implantable, non-tethered LVAD.|$|E
50|$|A tidal {{course is}} any {{elongated}} indentation or valley in a wetland originated by tidal processes, or having another origin, along which water <b>flows</b> <b>pumped</b> by tidal influence.|$|R
50|$|Axial-flow pumps {{have small}} diameters but give {{relatively}} modest pressure increases. Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> {{work well with}} low-density fluids. Centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high-density fluids but require large diameters for low-density fluids.|$|R
50|$|The aquifer has mainly {{horizontal}} <b>flow.</b> <b>Pumped</b> wells, if present, {{receive their}} {{water from the}} aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and hydraulic conductivity.|$|R
50|$|This concept utilises an axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{to force}} the water {{from one side of}} the ship to other rather than {{allowing}} it to slosh as in passive systems. Webster (1967) studied the design of such a tank in detail. The main disadvantage to this is that when the pump is operated there is a time lag for a sizeable amount of fluid to arrive at a tank, thus limiting instant roll stabilization. Hence, compared to fin stabiliser systems, this is highly inefficient.|$|E
50|$|An axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> has a propeller-type of {{impeller}} {{running in}} a casing.The pressure in an AFP is developed by the flow of liquid over the blades of impeller. The fluid is pushed in a direction {{parallel to the shaft}} of the impeller, that is, fluid particles, in course of their flow through the pump, do not change their radial locations. It allows the fluid to enter the impeller axially and discharge the fluid nearly axially. The propeller of an AFP is driven by a motor.|$|E
50|$|The Hemopump was {{designed}} to allow for temporary support of a failing heart. It is a continuous <b>flow</b> <b>pump,</b> and {{does not need to}} be synced to the rhythm of the heart. It assists in temporary heart stimulation with conditions such as cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction, heart failure from cardiopulmonary bypass, and more. The pump can continually monitor the left ventricle, which allows for perpetual observation of the hearts condition. This allows for any necessary changes to be made when needed. The pump operates at speeds between two hundred and ninety and four hundred and seventy revolutions per minute.|$|E

50|$|More {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on continuous <b>flow</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{which can be}} roughly categorized as either centrifugal <b>pumps</b> or axial <b>flow</b> impeller driven <b>pumps.</b> These pumps {{have the advantage of}} greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability. These devices are referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a pulse,or that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced.|$|R

50|$|Hurricane Gustav caused {{moderate}} damage to both parks. Many trees were snapped/uprooted, the Coca-Cola stage was destroyed, the awnings were blown {{off of the}} Azuka, {{a portion of the}} Pirate's Cove roof was blown off, and a storage building's metal chimney alongside of the Lazy River was knocked down (but still remains lying on the roof, and this item was actually damaged by Hurricane Isaac in 2012) (the storage building contains the Lazy River water <b>flow</b> <b>pump).</b> Multiple other attractions and buildings were affected. Lucky for Blue Bayou/Dixie Landin', they had just ended their season when this happened. They reopened in time for the 2009 season.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump</b> {{is shown in}} the figure. As shown in the figure, the head at the zero flow rate can be as much as three times the head at the pumpâ€™s best efficiency point. Also, the power requirement increases as the flow decreases, with the highest power drawn at the zero flow rate. This characteristic is opposite to that of a radial flow centrifugal pump where power requirement increases with an increase in the flow. Also the power requirements and pump head increases with an increase in pitch, thus allowing the pump to adjust according to the system conditions to provide the most efficient operation.|$|E
50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an axial <b>flow</b> <b>pump.</b> Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated {{in the direction of the}} rotor's axis.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{long-term}} mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for heart failure {{by means of}} implanted continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cf-LVADs) will increase, either to enable recovery or to provide a destination therapy. The effectiveness and user-friendliness of MCS {{will depend on the}} development of near-physiologic control strategies for which accurate estimation of <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> is essential. To provide means for the assessment of <b>pump</b> <b>flow,</b> this study presents pump models, estimating <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> (Q(lvad)) from <b>pump</b> speed (n) and pressure difference across the LVAD (Delta p(lvad)) or power uptake (P). The models are evaluated for the axial-flow LVADs HeartAssist 5 (HA 5) and HeartMate II (HMII), and for a centrifugal pump, the HeartWare (HW). For all three pumps, models estimating Q(lvad) from Delta p(lvad) only is capable of describing pump behavior under static conditions. For the axial <b>pumps,</b> <b>flow</b> estimation from power uptake alone was not accurate. When assuming an increase in <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> with increasing power uptake, low <b>pump</b> <b>flows</b> are overestimated in these pumps. Only for the HW, <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> increased linearly with power uptake, resulting in a power-based pump model that estimates static <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> accurately. The addition of pressure head measurements improved accuracy in the axial cf-LVAD estimation model...|$|R
50|$|Electric {{submersible}} pumps are multistage centrifugal pumps {{operating in a}} vertical position. Liquids, accelerated by the impeller, lose their kinetic energy in the diffuser where a conversion of kinetic to pressure energy takes place. This is the main operational mechanism of radial and mixed <b>flow</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} issue with continuous <b>flow</b> <b>pumps</b> is {{the method used}} to suspend the rotor. Early versions used solid bearings; however, newer pumps, {{some of which are}} approved for use in the EU, use either magnetic levitation ("maglev") or hydrodynamic suspension. These pumps contain only one moving part (the rotor).|$|R
