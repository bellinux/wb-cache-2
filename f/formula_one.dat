5|$|Schumacher {{is often}} {{credited}} with popularising <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> in Germany, {{where it was}} formerly considered a fringe sport. When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers were German, {{more than any other}} nationality and more than have ever been present in <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> history. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> drivers. In the latter part of his <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> career, and as one of the senior drivers, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. In a 2006 FIA survey, Michael Schumacher was voted the most popular driver of the season among <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> fans.|$|E
5|$|A {{barrister}} {{and former}} amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a racing car constructor and <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters {{for the company}} between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> Constructors' Association (FOCA), the body that represents <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated {{the first version of}} the Concorde Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of <b>Formula</b> <b>One.</b> Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Although March {{considered}} quitting <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> {{on several}} occasions, money was always found to support {{at least one}} car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled P34. The resulting March 2-4-0 never competed in <b>Formula</b> <b>One,</b> but generated the required publicity and a Scalextric slotcar model was profitable. Mosley {{spent much of his}} time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> teams, such as Williams and Penske. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> ended the same year.|$|E

5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in <b>Formula</b> <b>One,</b> {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Andretti won the 1978 <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> World Championship, four IndyCar titles (three under USAC-sanctioning, {{one under}} CART), and IROC VI. To date, he {{remains the only}} driver ever to win the Indianapolis 500 (1969), Daytona 500 (1967) and the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> World Championship, and, along with Juan Pablo Montoya, the only driver to have won a race in the NASCAR Cup Series, <b>Formula</b> <b>One,</b> and an Indianapolis 500. No American has won a <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> race since Andretti's victory at the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix. Andretti had 109 career wins on major circuits.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in <b>Formula</b> <b>One,</b> and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> team was MRD.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> engine supplier.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't until 1975 that Andretti drove a full <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> season, for the American Parnelli team. The {{team was}} new to <b>Formula</b> <b>One,</b> {{although}} it had been successful in both Formula 5000 and IndyCar racing in America with Andretti driving. The team had run Andretti in the two North American end-of-season races in 1974 with promising results. Andretti qualified fourth and led the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix for nine laps before his suspension failed. He scored five championship points in the season. Andretti continued to compete in IndyCar, missing two <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> races {{in the middle of}} the season to do so.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, Webber {{signed a}} new {{contract}} committing him to the Red Bull team for the 2010 <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> season. Three days later, he finished third in Hungary, moving into {{second place in the}} Drivers' Championship. Webber also set his first ever fastest lap in <b>Formula</b> <b>One.</b> On 21 September 2009 the FIA banned Webber's manager, Flavio Briatore, from all FIA related activities and announced that it would not renew the superlicence for any driver managed or otherwise associated with Briatore. Since then, Briatore has been reinstated into <b>Formula</b> <b>One</b> and negotiations concerning management has since been declared legal.|$|E
