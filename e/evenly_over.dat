5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

25|$|The die is a {{negative}} image of the glass master: typically, several are made, depending {{on the number of}} pressing mills that are to make the CD.

Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.|$|E

25|$|In the {{politics}} of the 1930s, Ryti was an important background figure. His social policy was two-minded. Ryti opposed work programmes for the unemployed and spending on assistance for poor. On the other hand, he thought that the benefits of the strong economics should be distributed <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> the whole population, not just a few. Ryti played an important part in creating the social welfare of the late 1930s. In general, Ryti was opposed to state intervention in business and industry. He opposed Socialist economics and especially its Soviet forms. Furthermore, Ryti had experienced the Russification period and the Civil War, making him anti-Soviet. Ryti approved of neither German national socialism nor right-wing extremism, and he also opposed the Lapua movement. Ryti was an admirer of British civilisation and culture and of American free enterprise.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a modified Standard Class 7 boiler, with smaller steel cylinders and other modifications to save weight and hence increase route availability. [...] The wider firebox, designed for use with cheaper imported coal, was also utilised to spread its weight <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> the axles, whilst the standard smokebox completed the boiler, which at 225lbf/inÂ² was rated at a lower working pressure {{than that of the}} Britannias. [...] A single chimney was incorporated into the design, although this was to create problems later on, due to its small diameter, which reduced the choke area that allowed the fierce exhaust blast to escape, reducing the overall efficiency of the locomotive. Similarities with the Britannias rested with the frames, tenders and running gear, allowing easy standardisation of parts common with other classes. [...] The design was fitted with a standard set of two Walschaerts valve gear systems, and all members of the class were equipped with 4,200 gallon BR 1 tenders.|$|E

500|$|The {{basis of}} the Leader {{originated}} from a 1944 review of the Southern Railway's steam locomotive fleet, resulting in a Southern Railway design brief which called for a high-powered locomotive requiring little maintenance to replace the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines. The brief also stipulated that the locomotive would be used on both passenger and freight trains, requiring high route availability. Bulleid proposed an initial design [...] based on his SR Q1 class locomotive, which had proved easy to maintain in service. As the proposal progressed, Bulleid saw that certain tasks required with conventional steam locomotives could be eliminated by adopting some {{of the features of}} the contemporary Southern electric locomotives. However, one of the subsequent designs of a 0-4-4-0 wheel arrangement had an unacceptably high axle-loading of , which increased the risk of damaging the Southern Railway's track. By developing the proposal further, Bulleid settled for a 0-6-0+0-6-0 design of bogied tank locomotive, which spread the weight more <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> the rails and reduced the axle-loading.|$|E
500|$|In Chinese opera, {{breath is}} based in the pubic region and {{supported}} by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that [...] "Strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages" [...] (zhong qi xing xiang). Breath is visualized being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region {{to the top of the}} head. This [...] "cavity" [...] must be under the performer's control at all times, and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as [...] "exchanging breath" [...] (huan qi) and [...] "stealing breath" [...] (tou qi). [...] "Exchanging breath" [...] is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. [...] "Stealing breath" [...] is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is [...] "saving the breath" [...] (cun qi). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be [...] "exchanged" [...] or [...] "stolen". These intervals are often marked by carats.|$|E
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> the drying floorâ€”a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E
