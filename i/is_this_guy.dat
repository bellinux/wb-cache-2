500|$|In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter then details Ashenoff's {{first foray}} in to {{professional}} wrestling: [...] "Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), {{where he was}} led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as “Kiss.” De los Santos {{took one look at}} the 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take –– what the hell <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> doing here, and, how quickly can I get this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, an Afghan man {{approached}} the NDS claiming to represent senior Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. Offering a letter allegedly written by Mansour, he said Mansour was interested {{to open a}} channel for negotiations. Saleh's people started testing the credentials of the supposed messenger, and judged them to be false, closing the case. The man then approached other Afghan government institutions. Saleh recounts, [...] "When I learned ... {{that he was going}} through a different avenue, I warned the government that if it is this Aminullah, if he claims this, and if it <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> trust me, he is not representing anybody; it's a scam. ... Be careful. This is not Mansour. But there was a perception that Amrullah is against talks, so let's sideline him." [...] The Afghan man, who lived in Pakistan where the Taliban's leadership council is based, subsequently held three meetings with NATO and Afghan officials. Having been flown from Pakistan to Kabul on a NATO airplane, the man met with President Karzai in the presidential palace. In late 2010, it turned out, that the supposed representative for Mansour was an impostor as Saleh had previously warned. The New York Times writes: [...] "In an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel, United States and Afghan officials now say the Afghan man was an impostor." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's release {{followed}} the commercial success of other mafioso-themed rap albums with similar subject matter, including Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996) and AZ's Doe or Die (1995). Music writers criticized its mainstream, R and pop-leaning sound, {{as well as}} the enlistment of a top production unit and popular guest artists. The album's lyrics and themes were also poorly received and heavily dismissed as an attempt by Nas to follow the popularity of gangsta and mafioso rap. Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote negatively of Nas's themes and called it [...] "the latest blatant example of trashy tough-guy talk", writing [...] "Certainly he strikes a note of creepy realism in his stories of heavyweight dealing and literally cutthroat competition. 'The Set Up', 'Shootouts' and 'Affirmative Action' [...] are chilling in their how-many-grams-to-a-kilo detail and utter amorality. On 'Watch Dem Niggas', Nas cites as inspirations both the boxing coach Cus D'Amato and the murderous drug lord Pablo Escobar. What <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> thinking?". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that he [...] "continually shifts perspective" [...] and called it [...] "late-stage gangsta rap, starting to buckle under its own contradictions." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "neither" [...] (...) rating, indicating [...] "may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two.

2500|$|The {{audience}} {{disagreed with}} Carruthers. They expressed {{that the show}} made a [...] "ludicrous decision" [...] to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, {{it was reported that}} Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog [...] {{to set the record straight}} and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: [...] "Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> from Fox news and what does he know?" [...] She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. [...] "I was talking about the character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [...] not Julia getting let go." ...|$|E

Then. Lopez felt that Jackson's [...] "clear and spacious" [...] records made her feel a [...] "certain way". She said, [...] "It has such a {{beautiful}} quality on it, and every time I looked at a record , it would be engineered and mixed by Bruce Swedien. I was like, 'Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> I want this guy.' So I tracked him down and he was like, 'I want to do something with her. I know exactly what she needs. I'm coming in.' And it made a huge difference." [...] Lopez worked closely with longtime producer Cory Rooney on the album. Discussing the process, Rooney stated, [...] "This is by far the best record that I've ever worked on or done [...] In the beginning of the recording [...] she said it's important that she makes a record that is a few notches above everything else she did. She wanted to show growth musically and vocally." [...] Other producers Lopez worked with primarily were Troy Oliver, Loren Hill and Dan Shea. She had previously collaborated with Oliver and Shea on J.Lo (2001).|$|E
