5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} resists compromising on Jewish {{control of}} the Land of Israel, even when this means conflict {{with the state of}} Israel. Thus, Chardalim comprised many of the most forceful opponents of anti-disengagement movement in the 2000s, and continue to actively oppose the removal of small settlements unauthorized by the government. Generally, this opposition is passive and verbal, but in rare cases, it has <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> vandalism of Israeli army property or stone-throwing at soldiers.|$|E

An estimated 93.5% of {{the population}} ages 6–14 attend an institution of education. Estimated 12.8% of residents of the state have obtained a college degree.

Evans was keen to return to radio.

25|$|Around 322 BC, the Greeks (described as Yona or Yavana in Indian sources) {{may then}} have participated, {{together}} with other groups, in the armed uprising of Chandragupta Maurya against the Nanda Dynasty, and <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Pataliputra for the capture of the city from the Nandas. The Mudrarakshasa of Visakhadutta {{as well as the}} Jaina work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan king Parvatka, often identified with Porus, and according to these accounts, this alliance gave Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of Yavanas (Greeks), Kambojas, Shakas (Scythians), Kiratas (Nepalese), Parasikas (Persians) and Bahlikas (Bactrians) who took Pataliputra.|$|E
25|$|Today {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the variety in which we see beatboxing throughout musical culture. People have <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> adding beatboxing in with different instruments to create a completely different sound unlike any other. Artist Greg Patillo goes as far as adding in beatboxing while playing the flute to very iconic songs. Beatbox has become modernized and has even been seen in popular movies such as Pitch Perfect and Pitch Perfect 2. Both of these movies showcase classical songs performed with a Capella covers in which all of the beats to the songs are done completely using the idea and technique of beatboxing to complete the sound capable to imitate the original song.|$|E

25|$|The Progressive Conservative {{government}} of the time, headed by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, did not accept the invitation {{to establish a new}} Canadian flag, so Pearson made it Liberal Party policy in 1961, and part of the party's election platform in the 1962 and 1963 federal elections. During the election campaign of 1963, Pearson promised that Canada would have a new flag within two years of his election. No previous party leader had ever <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Pearson did, by putting a time limit on finding a new national flag for Canada. The 1963 election brought the Liberals back to power, but with a minority government. In February 1964, a three-leaf design was leaked to the press.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah {{was called}} to prophetic {{ministry}} c. 626BC. Jeremiah was called by YHWH to give prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction that would occur by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had been unfaithful {{to the laws of}} the covenant and had forsaken God by worshiping Baal. The people of Israel had even <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> building high altars to Baal in order to burn their children in fire as offerings. This nation had deviated so far from God that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would be faced with famine, plundered and taken captive by foreigners who would exile them to a foreign land.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{voters in}} 1997 {{approved}} $100 million in city spending {{to build a}} new stadium and an attached shopping mall at Candlestick Point. However, even after voter approval to grant economic help for the project, the stadium was not constructed. This was because owner Eddie DeBartolo, Jr. was facing legal troubles, which led him to surrender ownership of the team to his sister Denise DeBartolo York and brother-in-law John York. Mills Corporation, the company chosen by the 49ers, was unable to put together a plan to successfully construct a new stadium for the team. NFL owners had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> awarding the new stadium the rights to host Super Bowl XXXVII. When stadium plans stalled, the game went to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium instead.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 {{and arrived at}} Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; {{there was plenty of}} fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the main}} UK {{political}} parties had expressed {{concerns about the}} rising costs and value of a ten-yearly census, and on coming into office the UK coalition government had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> suggesting that the 2011 census {{might be the last}} of its kind. In July 2010 the UK government asked ONS to explore other methods of measuring the population. In 2011 the three national statistics bodies, ONS, GROS and NISRA set up a co-ordinated research project known as Beyond 2011. The objectives of the programme were to assess the feasibility of improving UK population statistics using integrated data sources to replace or complement existing approaches, and whether alternative data sources could provide the priority statistics on the characteristics of small populations typically provided by a census. The project reported its findings in March 2014 and recommended that a UK-wide census in 2021 should take place, and that better use should be made of other demographic data sources.|$|E
25|$|Neither of the {{conditions}} agreed in Edinburgh had been met. The only French assistance was the landing of 800 troops in Montrose on 24 November, while {{there was no sign}} of support from English Jacobite leaders; the Manchester recruits had been a one-off, only three joined in Derby. Similar discussions were held in both Preston and Manchester and several senior officers felt they should have turned back at Preston. Murray argued they had <b>gone</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible and now risked being caught between Cumberland in the south-west and Wade in the north, each army being twice the size of theirs. The admission by Charles that he had not been contacted by any English Jacobites or the French since landing in Scotland was greeted with incredulity by the Council. As this meant he had lied in Edinburgh when claiming otherwise, his relationship with the Scots was fatally damaged. Despite frantic attempts by Charles, the Council was overwhelmingly in favour of retreat and the next day they left Derby and headed north.|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} (1994-2000), Janša was {{frequently}} accused by political {{opponents of the}} radicalization of the public discourse. Some <b>went</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to accuse him of political extremism. Janša's former friend and fellow dissident Spomenka Hribar heavily criticized him. She accused him of extreme nationalism and chauvinism, placing feelings over rationality, and exploiting patriotic emotions among the population. Condemning his irredentist claims towards Croatia, she even <b>went</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> denouncing his policies as obvious neo-fascism.|$|R
