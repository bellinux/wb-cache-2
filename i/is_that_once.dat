5|$|Another legend <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once,</b> while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E

Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E

The reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> a sub-problem is small enough, it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache {{in this way is}} called cache-oblivious, because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter.|$|E

25|$|Designing {{systems in}} churches and similar {{religious}} facilities often poses a challenge, because the speakers {{may have to}} be unobtrusive to blend in with antique woodwork and stonework. In some cases, audio designers have designed custom-painted speaker cabinets so that the speakers will blend in with the church architecture. Some church facilities, such as sanctuaries or chapels are long rooms with low ceilings, which means that additional fill-in speakers are needed throughout the room to give good coverage. An additional challenge with church SR systems <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>once</b> installed, they are often operated by amateur volunteers from the congregation, which means that they must be easy to operate and troubleshoot.|$|E
25|$|There {{has always}} been {{speculation}} on why this sacrifice of male mates might occur despite the obvious disadvantage to the sacrificial males. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> the male has mated, he is unlikely to mate again and so any further extension of his life is of lesser evolutionary benefit than his indirectly contributing nutrition to the eggs. Having more offspring would give the male the advantage of having his genes passed on over other males that might avoid being eaten. This scenario {{would be consistent with}} Roberts’ hypothesis that old or unfit males get eaten, whilst younger and fitter ones may survive to mate again.|$|E
25|$|Many {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain what caused this huge slab of rocks to start sliding and what allowed it to slide so far on such a low slope, fragmenting, thinning and extending as it went. Most geologists who have worked in the area agree that Absaroka volcanism {{played a role in}} the sliding and many suggest that a major volcanic or steam explosion initiated movement. Another model involves injection of numerous igneous dikes with the resulting heating of water within pores in rocks causing an increase in pressure which initiated sliding. Some geologists have suggested that hot pressurized water (hydrothermal fluids), derived from a volcano which sat north of Cooke City, Montana, effectively lubricated the sliding surface. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> the slide was moving, friction heated the limestone along the sliding surface, creating pseudotachylite, which then further broke down to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas (or supercritical fluid). The gas supported the slide in the way that air pressure supports a hovercraft, allowing the slide to move easily down the very low slope. When the rockslide stopped, the carbon dioxide cooled and recombined with calcium oxide to form the cement-like carbonate rock now found in the fault zone. The consensus favors catastrophic sliding and calculations suggest that the front of the sliding mass may have advanced at a speed of over 100 miles/hour (160km/h), meaning that the mountain traveled to its present location in approximately 30 minutes.|$|E

500|$|When Sean Connery {{had been}} cast in November 1961, David Niven had been Fleming's {{choice for the}} role as the actor {{reflected}} his image of the character. In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale, a film not made by Eon Productions. Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role. Niven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses. The concept of Bond <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the [...] "other Bond" [...] was that played by Connery.|$|E
500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding rates of change. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{influences}} on Monty Python, {{the members of}} the comedy team are described as being [...] "indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the Goon Show." [...] The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore (1985, p.170) cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated [...] "the Goon Show influenced us enormously". He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's (2002, p.151) book: [...] "We all loved The Goon Show in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>once</b> somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it".|$|E
