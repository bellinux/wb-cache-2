40|$|New Jersey municipalities, {{with the}} {{intention}} of intensifying development around rail stations and bus hubs. As one test of the effectiveness of this state effort, the appreciation in residential property values is investigated and compared with that in other municipalities in the state. Some limited positive evidence is found to support the New <b>Jersey</b> transit <b>village</b> designation. Econometric analysis of the change in average residential sales price over 9 years finds an association but cannot establish a causal effect. Case study analysis of selected New <b>Jersey</b> transit <b>villages</b> suggests that the forethought, commitment, and political will required to apply for transit village status may be what sparks municipal development rather than the designation itself. Since its inception in 1999, the New <b>Jersey</b> Transit <b>Village</b> Initiative was designed to encourage smart growth near transit stations.
