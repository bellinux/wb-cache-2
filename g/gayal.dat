The other two species are the horse and pig. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), <b>gayal</b> (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, <b>gayal,</b> boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the whole}} we may conclude, more {{especially}} from the researches of Boyd Dawkins, that European cattle are descended from two species; {{and there is no}} improbability in this fact, for the genus Bos readily yields to domestication. Besides these two species and the zebu, the yak, the <b>gayal,</b> and the arni (3/47. Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3, 96.) (not to mention the buffalo or genus Bubalus) have been domesticated; making altogether six species of Bos. The zebu and the two European species are now extinct in a wild state. Although certain races of cattle were domesticated at a very ancient period in Europe, it does not follow that they were first domesticated here. Those who place much reliance on philology argue that they were imported from the East. (3/48. Idem tome 3 pages 82, 91.) It is probable that they originally inhabited a temperate or cold climate, but not a land long covered with snow; for our cattle, as {{we have seen in the}} chapter on Horses, have not the instinct of scraping away the snow to get at the herbage beneath. No one could behold the magnificent wild bulls on the bleak Falkland Islands in the southern hemisphere, and doubt about the climate being admirably suited to them. Azara has remarked that in the temperate regions of La Plata the cows conceive when two years old, whilst in the much hotter country of Paraguay they do not conceive till three years old; [...] "from which fact," [...] as he adds, [...] "one may conclude that cattle do not succeed so well in warm countries."

In Nagaland, the animals are kept semi-wild, and live in herds, being watched over by special caretakers assigned by the villages or the owner of the herd. They respond to a horn kept specially for the individual caretaker or actual owner to call them. From birth until the time of butchering or market, the Mithun remain in the herd, and roam mostly freely throughout the forests.|$|R

50|$|The <b>gayal</b> differs {{in several}} {{important}} particulars from the gaur. It is somewhat smaller, with proportionately shorter limbs, and stands much lower at the withers. The ridge {{on the back}} is less developed, and bulls have a larger dewlap on the throat. The head is shorter and broader, with a perfectly flat forehead and a straight line between the bases of the horns. The thick and massive horns are less flattened and much less curved than in the gaur, extending almost directly outwards {{from the sides of}} the head, and curving somewhat upwards at the tips, but without any inward inclination. Their extremities are thus much farther apart than in the gaur. The female <b>gayal</b> is much smaller than the bull, and has scarcely any dewlap on the throat. The skin colour of the head and body is blackish-brown in both sexes, and the lower portion of the limbs are white or yellowish. The horns are of uniform blackish tint from base to tip. Some domesticated gayals are parti-coloured, while others are completely white.|$|E

5000|$|The {{role of the}} mithun {{is central}} to the lives of many {{residents}} of these areas, including transhumant ones who pair mithun management with sago palm harvesting: Although livestock is highly characteristic of the high Himalayan way of life in general, with yaks and sheep being predominant species until recently, the mithun, or <b>gayal</b> (Bos frontalis) is the most prominent animal exploited by Eastern Himalayan groups... The mithun is a semi-domesticate, managed in fenced tracts of forests rather than being kept in or near villages. Outside North East India, mithun are primarily imported for the purpose of cross- breeding with other bovids, for example in Bhutan. It is very common among Eastern Himalayan languages to find lexical sets denoting fauna in which the mithun is lexicalized as a “prototypical” meat animal, with all other terms being derived... Terms for ‘mithun’ in other languages of Arunachal Pradesh are typically cognate with Aka fu (e.g. Miji ʃu, Koro sù, Puroik ʧa and Proto-Tani *ɕo), suggesting that this is probably not a case of semantic shift from a wild species.

50|$|There is {{controversy}} among scholars {{about the}} original homeland of the Guptas. Jayaswal {{has pointed out}} that the Guptas were originally inhabitants of Prayaga (Allahabad), Uttar Pradesh, in north India, as the vassal of the Nagas or Bhaarshivas. Thereafter they rose in prominence. Another scholar, <b>Gayal</b> supported the theory of Jaiswal, suggesting that the original home of the Guptas was Antarvedi embracing the regions of Oudh and Prayag. These historians have derived their theory from several Gupta Dynasty coins found in those regions, and this study of numismatic evidence led to the theory that the Guptas were the original inhabitants of that region of northeastern India. However another historian of this time in Indian history, Ganguli, has offered a different view about the original Gupta homeland. According to him the Guptas homeland is further south, the Murshidabad region of Bengal, and not Magadha in Bihar. He based his theory on the statement of the Chinese Buddhist monk, Yijing (I-Tsing), who visited India during 675 and 695 CE. Fleet and other historians however criticize Ganguli's theory because Sri Gupta ruled during the end of the 3rd century, but Yijing placed him {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Hence the theory of historians, who have provided their views based on the accounts of Yijing, are considered less valid than theories based on other sources such as coinage.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are large}} numbers of domesticated gaur, yak and Bactrian camel in China but in the wild, they are Class I {{protected}} species. The gaur or Indian bison is the tallest species of cattle and found in southern Tibet and Yunnan. Domesticated gaur, called <b>gayal,</b> is raised by farmers in Yunnan. Yaks are the largest animals on the Tibetan Plateau. Wild yaks are larger than domestic yaks and slightly smaller than the gaur. They can tolerate extremely cold climate, climb steep slopes, and ford fierce rapids. Yaks are the imost important animal for Tibetan herders, who eat yak meat and milk for food, burn yak dung as fuel, spin yak hair into fabric, make yak hide leather and use yaks to transport and plow fields. Bactrian camels have two humps and can go a month or longer without drinking water. A thirsty Bactrian camel can drink 135 liters (30 gallons) in only 13 minutes. [...] They can withstand extremely hot and cold weather and have broad hooves that do not sink in desert. Bactrian camels are known as the [...] "boats of desert" [...] - for millennia, {{they are used to}} carry good along the Silk Road.

40|$|<b>Gayal</b> (Bos frontalis) is a semi domesticated and {{endangered}} bovine species in Bangladesh. This {{study was conducted}} to know the present distribution, performances and utility of <b>gayal</b> in the home tract. Bandarban Hill district was found the home tract of <b>gayal</b> in Bangladesh. Gayals were reared under extensive management system in the forest of Bandarban Hill district. They browsed forest herbs and grass freely in the forest and came to human dwelling for salt licking. Total number of <b>gayal</b> was counted between 800 - 900. The average number of <b>gayal</b> per farmer was 5. 01. The coat color of adult <b>gayal</b> was black. White stocking was very prominent in adult <b>gayal.</b> The height at wither and weight for adult males ranged from 126 to 136 cm and 490 to 577 kg, respectively. Reproductive efficiency was high and calving interval was 402 days. They exhibited high disease resistant. The PVC (Pack Cell Volume) and hemoglobin value was 33. 5 ± 5. 71 % and 13. 43 ± 2. 9 g/dl, respectively. <b>Gayal</b> was used only as meat animal. The high growth rate and reproductive efficiency of <b>gayal</b> in the home tract indicates that this species can be utilized economically if proper breeding plan and sound extension service can be adopted...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{variation}} in coat color, size, and production traits among indigenous Bangladeshi cattle populations, genetic differences among most of the populations have not been investigated or exploited. In this study, we used a high-density bovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 80 K Bead Chip derived from Bos indicus breeds to assess genetic diversity and population structure of 2 Bangladeshi zebu cattle populations (red Chittagong, n = 28 and non-descript deshi, n = 28) and a semi-domesticated population (<b>gayal,</b> n = 17). Overall, 95 % and 58 % of the total SNPs (69, 804) showed polymorphisms in the zebu and <b>gayal</b> populations, respectively. Similarly, the average minor allele frequency value was as high 0. 29 in zebu and as low as 0. 09 in <b>gayal.</b> The mean expected heterozygosity varied from 0. 42 ± 0. 14 in zebu to 0. 148 ± 0. 14 in <b>gayal</b> with significant heterozygosity deficiency of 0. 06 (FIS) in the latter. Coancestry estimations revealed that the two zebu populations are weakly differentiated, with over 99 % of the total genetic variation retained within populations and less than 1 % accounted for between populations. Conversely, strong genetic differentiation (FST = 0. 33) was observed between zebu and <b>gayal</b> populations. Results of population structure and principal component analyses suggest that <b>gayal</b> is distinct from Bos indicus and that the two zebu populations were weakly structured.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} major {{histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) plays important roles in pathogen recognition and disease resistance. In the present study, the coding sequence and the 50 - and 30 -untranslated regions of MHC class II DR alpha chain (the DRA gene) from rare <b>gayal</b> and gaytle were cloned and analyzed to dissect structural and functional variations. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the DRA genes in <b>gayal</b> (Bofr-DRA) and gaytle (Bofr £ BoLA-DRA) were almost identical to those for cattle and yak (99 %). Compared to yak, two amino acids substitutions in the signal peptide (SP) domain for <b>gayal</b> were found within all Bos animals. Except for only one replacement in the amino acid within the a 2 domain of the DRA protein in <b>gayal,</b> the additional residues were highly conserved across the species investigated. The 20 peptide-binding sites (PBS) of Bofr-DRA and Bofr £ BoLA-DRA were essentially reserved in the a 1 domain among all species investigated. The lesser degree of substitution in Bofr-DRA is concordant with the concept that the DRA gene is highly conserved among all mammals.

For the six populations studied, number of effective alleles (Ne) ranged from 2. 2043 to 3. 2754, mean heterozygosity (H) ranged from 0. 4858 to 0. 6153, and mean polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0. 4230 to 0. 5711. The five indigenous Chinese yak breeds had high genetic diversity at the microsatellite DNA level, while the <b>gayal</b> showed less genetic variation. The genetic differentiation among the populations was very low, with a Gst value of 0. 0527. In neighbor-joining and fuzzy clustering trees, the five yak breeds grouped into two clades, one comprising Jiulong yaks and the other including Pali, Sibu, Tibetan High Mountainous yak and Maiwa yaks.

40|$|Several studies arduously {{reported}} that <b>gayal</b> (Bos frontalis) {{is an independent}} bovine species. The population size is shrinking across its distribution.

Their body size is much bigger than Bangladeshi native cattle and has prominent beef type characters along with the ability to adjust in any adverse environmental conditions. Human interactions and manipulation of biodiversity is affecting the habitats of gayals in recent decades. Besides, the only artificial reproduction center for gayals, Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI), has few animals and could not carry out its long term conservation scheme {{due to a lack of}} an objective based scientific mission as well as financial support. This indicates that the current population is much more susceptible to stochastic events which might be natural catastrophes, environmental changes or mutations. Further reduction of the population size will sharply reduce genetic diversity. In our recent investigation with 80 K indicine single nucleotide polymorphism chip, the FIS (within-population inbreeding) value was reported as 0. 061 ± 0. 229 and the observed (0. 153 ± 0. 139) and expected (0. 148 ± 0. 143) heterozygosities indicated a highly inbred and less diverse <b>gayal</b> population in Bangladesh.
