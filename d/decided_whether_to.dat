5|$|The ACLU was {{internally}} divided when it purged Communists {{from its}} leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> defend alleged Communists {{during the late}} 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about {{the threat posed by}} Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> replace {{her at a}} cost of $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E

Drawing on Milgrom and Roberts (1982) and Kreps and Wilson (1982), we show that, under certain conditions, parents have the incentive to penalise older children for their adolescent risk-taking behaviour in order to dissuade their younger children from such behaviour when reaching adolescence. We find evidence in favour of this parental reputation model. Copyright � 2008 The Author(s). ...|$|R

25|$|The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau has {{estimated}} that the by-elections would cost HK$150million (US$19.3million). The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and the Liberal Party have not <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> approve the LegCo budget for the election. However, instead of making a separate appropriation request for the by-elections, the government provided for HK$159million in its budget proposal, {{making it difficult for}} lawmakers to veto the funding.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} of Army, Navy, Air Force, CIA, NSA, and State Department representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods. The U-2 project received {{the list and}} drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan {{for the president to}} consider as he <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> approve it. The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs. Before the aircraft became operational, however, the air force's Project Genetrix, which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many diplomatic protests from those countries and for a while CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk. While Genetrix was also a technical failure—only 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs—the balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program.|$|E

500|$|This {{message was}} {{read to the}} Commons later in the morning, and the MPs decided to simply ignore it, not even bothering to reply. In {{response}} to the message, the Lords proposed eight alterations to the petition and the modification of the imprisonment clause to appease the king. When these changes were debated on 13 May, they were all rejected except for one minor change in wording. The Lords still favoured a compromise, and suggested {{the addition of a}} paragraph to the petition reading [...] "We humbly present this petition to your majesty, not only with a care of preserving our own liberties, but with due regard to leave entire that sovereign power, wherewith your majesty is trusted, for the protection, safety, and happiness of your people". By 20 May the Commons had agreed to one more minor alteration, but had not <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> accept the new paragraph. Coke made a speech urging them to reject all of it, saying that to use the phrase [...] "sovereign power" [...] would mean admitting that the King had the power to destroy any limitations the Petition might place on his power".|$|E

500|$|Fillmore {{received}} the Whig vice presidential nomination in 1848 as Taylor's running mate, {{and the two}} were elected. He was largely ignored by Taylor, including in the dispensing of patronage in New York, on which Taylor consulted Weed and Seward. As vice president, Fillmore presided over angry debates in the Senate as Congress <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> allow slavery in the Mexican Cession. [...] Fillmore supported Henry Clay's Omnibus Bill (the basis of the 1850 Compromise) though Taylor did not. [...] After President Taylor died in July 1850, Fillmore dismissed the cabinet and changed the administration's policy. [...] The new president exerted pressure to gain {{the passage of the}} Compromise, which gave legislative victories to both North and South, and which was enacted by September. [...] The Fugitive Slave Act, expediting the return of escaped slaves to those who claimed ownership, was a controversial part of the Compromise, and Fillmore felt himself duty-bound to enforce it, though it damaged his popularity and also the Whig Party, which was torn North from South. [...] In foreign policy, Fillmore supported U.S. Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan, opposed French designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by Narciso López's filibuster expeditions to Cuba. He sought election to a full term in 1852, but was passed over by the Whigs in favor of Winfield Scott.|$|E
