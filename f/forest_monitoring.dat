50|$|Efforts to curb {{global climate}} change have {{included}} measures designed to monitor the progression of deforestation in Indonesia and incentivise national and local governments to halt it.

5000|$|Main {{international}} organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank, {{have begun to}} develop programs aimed at curbing deforestation. The blanket term Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) describes these sorts of programs, which use direct monetary or other incentives to encourage developing countries to limit and/or roll back deforestation. Funding has been an issue, but at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010-2012. Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote <b>forest</b> <b>monitoring</b> using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the Center for Global Development's FORMA (<b>Forest</b> <b>Monitoring</b> for Action) initiative [...] and the Group on Earth Observations' Forest Carbon Tracking Portal. Methodological guidance for <b>forest</b> <b>monitoring</b> was also emphasized at COP-15. The environmental organization Avoided Deforestation Partners leads the campaign for development of REDD through funding from the U.S. government. In 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and partners launched Open Foris - a set of open-source software tools that assist countries in gathering, producing and disseminating information {{on the state of}} forest resources. The tools support the inventory lifecycle, from needs assessment, design, planning, field data collection and management, estimation analysis, and dissemination. Remote sensing image processing tools are included, as well as tools for international reporting for Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and MRV and FAO's Global Forest Resource Assessments.|$|E
