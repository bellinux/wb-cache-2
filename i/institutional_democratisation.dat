[...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000 This {{study is}} about the context of {{transformation}} at higher education institutions, but more specifically the transformation process at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (PU for CHE), a historically white university. The tracks of transformation at the PU for CHE since 1993 until {{the establishment of the}} Institutional Forum during 1999 were followed and conclusions were made about processes of change at institutions of higher learning. The Higher Education Act of 1997 requires of every institution of higher education to have an Institutional Forum as an advisory body to the University Council. This can be related to several problems that always accompany this process: • Some people treated transformation as if it's an event and not a process. • The composition (representation) of transformation structures is still questionable. • The legitimacy of the process itself in most cases is still questioned. • Lack of commitment and trust among some stakeholders i. e. there is always suspicion of hidden agenda. • Protection of the status quo in most universities makes it difficult for transform these instituions. However, it should be realised for whatever it is that, transformation entails a number of dimensions such as equity, governance, democracy, gender issues, student access and success, affirmative action, quality and development. Transformation is not only about political changes as some tend to define it. Transformation of higher education is generally regarded as a political transformation process, but if this process is not reformed into something more than political change, it will not be sustainable, nor will it contribute to better, more efficient or effective institutions of higher education. Initially, transformation was understood rather narrowly in terms of <b>institutional</b> <b>democratisation</b> - consequently it became a frequent cause of confrontation between students demanding full participation in institutional governance and resistant institutional administrations seeking to protect their exclusive management turf. At historically white universities black students saw transformation as a tool to overcome perceived racist arrogance. At black institutions students pushed for a say in setting fees and for an open-admissions policy irrespective of the ability to pay, or in deed, of academic performance. And so, the word "transformation" elicited different expectations and tensions from different constituencies. The transformation process also pointed to serious structural and process deficiencies at the PU for CHE from 1994 to 1999. These were: • A lack of capacity, not only in the knowledge of constituents in the transformation process, especially dealing with substantial issues, but also in terms of time and resources. The pressures from management, usually in terms of time frames made quality feed-back and contributions difficult to attain. • Participatory patterns were also not very satisfactory, especially from students, trade unions and external constituents. Long and extended. meetings made BTF meetings unpopular opportunities and the very busy schedules of students and staff made it difficult for parties to attend all meetings. Trade unions used the BTF to leverage support and power to attain goals that had {{very little to do with}} institutional transformation. • Transformation agendas were• not all pointing in the same direction. This was especially clear from the difficulty the BTP had in developing inputs on the Green Paper, the Statute and the extension of the terms• of office of the rector and vice-rector. • The forums were poorly resourced. • With the lack of capacity and the participatory patterns, the Broad Transformation Forum (BTF) and to a certain extend the Watuni. Transformation Committee (WTC) experienced legitimacy problems in terms of the impact of their decisions as well as the status that the Forums had within the University. • The legitimacy of the forums were also hampered by the lack of statutory definition of the forums, a situation that was partially resolved with the introduction of the Institutional Forum on 24 July 1999. For knowledge to have an impact in the international system, it must be widely accepted by policy makers. New knowledge can provide the basis for evolutionary change, which usually involves altering rules and procedures within the context of a given set of principles and norms. In contrast, revolutionary change, which generates new principles and norms, is associated with shifts in power. Master...|$|E

Practices of Freedom takes a different approach, calling into question this dominant narrative and taking the variety, hybridity and dispersion of social and political practices as its focus of analysis. Bringing together leading scholars in democratic theory and critical policy studies, it draws upon new understandings of radical democracy, practice and interpretative analysis to emphasise the productive role of actors and political conflict in the formation and reproduction of contemporary forms of democratic governance. Integrating theoretical dialogues with detailed empirical studies, this book examines spaces for <b>democratisation,</b> <b>institutional</b> design, democratic criteria and learning, whilst mobilising the frameworks of agonistic and aversive democracy, informality and decentred legitimacy in cases from youth engagement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has encouraged political scientists to re-examine the comparative literature on democratisation. A vast literature has now been produced comparing transitions from authoritarianism and democratisation {{in different parts of}} the world. However, there are two major omissions in the transition literature. First, the focus of research has primarily been on national level politics, and second, the relationship between federalism and democracy has largely been overlooked. This study seeks to redress this imbalance by moving the focus of research from the national level to the vitally important processes of institution building and democratisation at the local level and to the study of federalism and democratisation in Russia. Federal states are much more difficult to set up than unitary ones, and forging a new federal system at the same time as privatising the economy and trying to radically overhaul the political system has clearly made Russia's transition triply difficult. This book builds on Cameron Ross' earlier work, 'Regional Politics in Russia', by combining theoretical perspectives with empirical work to provide a comparative analysis of the electoral systems, party systems and governmental systems in the ethnic republics and regions and to assess the impact of theses different <b>institutional</b> arrangements on <b>democratisation</b> and federalism. Overall, this study argues that Russia's weak and asymmetrical form of federalism has played a major role in thwarting the consolidation of democracy. Federalism and democratisation in Russia exist in contradiction rather than harmony. In a vicious circle authoritarianism at the centre has been nourished by authoritarianism in the regions and vice versa. 'Elective dictatorships' and 'delegative democracies' are now well entrenched in many republics and authoritarian regimes are firmly established in a majority of the regions. This book will be vital reading for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of Russian politics and democratisation...|$|R

Fecha de lectura: febrero de 2015 The increasing role {{of national}} parliaments at EU level {{points in the}} direction of greater possibilities for the development of interparliamentary practices, particularly for parliamentary control purposes. However, research has paid little attention to the way these interparliamentary practices develop and work in practice. This thesis studies the interparliamentary practices developed {{in the context of the}} parliamentary control of Europol, the European Police Agency. Europol has evolved from its original institutional design as an intergovernmental body established by an international convention into a supranational agency fully integrated into the EU. Against this background, this research looks at the evolution of the parliamentary control of Europol in this process as a case of institutional development within EU representative-democratic institutions and discusses the relationship between integration (as <b>institutional</b> incorporation) and <b>democratisation.</b> Originally the European Parliament (EP) had almost no scrutiny role regarding Europol. However, in 2010 Europol became an EU agency and the EP acquired, among other things, some degree of control over the budget of Europol. On the other hand, the Lisbon Treaty provides for the political monitoring of Europol to be done by national parliaments and the European Parliament together (TFEU Art. 88). Provisions of the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been implemented but changes in the parliamentary practices have already taken place in preparation for the new modality in which both national parliaments and the EP will be involved. Given this background, the key question is how is the involvement of national parliaments and the EU in the parliamentary control of Europol best balanced? In this regards this thesis provides insights in the relative salience of interparliamentary coordination as compared to a strengthened role for the EP in the process of institutional incorporation of Europol...|$|R
40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} of this doctoral thesis {{is that the}} historical period which begun with the liberation of Greece from German occupation and ended with the electoral defeat of the New Democracy Party in 1981 {{is characterized by a}} pattern of certain values, ideas and political practices, regularly repeated, whereas, at the same time, the political landscape was constantly in a process of transformation, smooth or abrupt. All these values, ideas and political practices articulate the ideological profile of the Modern Greek Right, as this was constituted under the tension of the tragic Civil War (1944 - 49) that determined the future of the regime and imposed a climate of intense anti-communism. In this light, the post-war regime of the Right applied a policy not simply pro-western but also with nationalistic overtones and a dogmatic adherence to the cold-war ideological lines. ¶The right-wing monopoly on power contributed to the identification of the right-wing ideology with the functioning of the state and its institutions, such as, justice, education, mass communication, etc. At the same time, the emphasis on the role of charismatic leadership (Papagos, Karamanlis) undermined the functioning of right-wing party formations as institutions of representation and social mediation. ¶ Accordingly, the Greek state was characterized by a course of intense interventionism, authoritarian centralism, clientelism and favouritism. ¶This irrational state-organisation was not followed by an institutional modernisation, but by a parallel administration of the dysfunctions of the system on a purely ideological basis. ¶The supplementary aspect of repression was the establishment of selective motives for the loyalist citizens and the social groups that supported the regime. ¶ In this climate, the army and some right-wing organisations used to terrorise Greek society blackmailing for consensus; hence, the functioning of the political system was only epidermically democratic. ¶The most serious consequence of this situation appeared when a team of military conspirators imposed a military dictatorship (1967 - 74) appointing themselves as saviours of the nation from a vaguely defined communist threat. ¶ ¶The significant efforts of the renewed ideological Right following 1974 to introduce <b>institutional</b> normality and <b>democratisation,</b> were not absorbed substantially from the repressed society; neither did they alter the diachronically conservative profile of the right-wing constituency that considered with suspicion not only the collective claims but also the popular demand for a break with old mentalities and interests. ¶...|$|R
