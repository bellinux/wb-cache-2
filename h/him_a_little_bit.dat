500|$|Naming the {{characters}} after {{members of his}} own family, Homer was named after Groening's father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, [...] "Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts." [...] Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer. Homer's middle initial [...] "J", which stands for [...] "Jay", is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wesley matures {{significantly}} {{over the}} course of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; in his early appearances he was largely cowardly and incompetent. Alexis Denisof claims that his initial goal in playing the character was to be as annoying as possible for the other characters. He explains, I thought that an irritating version of Giles would be annoying for [...] and also for Buffy. Wesley's purpose was to come there and point the finger and get things shipshape. He's a by-the-book school teacher. Considering what kind of person it would be who would have dedicated his life to this peculiar task of being a Watcher, and what would be the unique characteristics of somebody who had made those decisions, and then was taken out of that environment and put into Sunnydale. To Wesley that was a completely new and bizarre place. During this time, Denisof came up with a background story for Wesley regarding his father to explain [...] "why he was so repressed." [...] The writers used this story in the show, alluding to it in early Angel episodes such as [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin", and [...] "Belonging". While discussing Wesley's character development {{over the course}} of Angel, Denisof explains: [...] "I decided that Wesley was internally confronting his father and that released <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and made him less repressed." ...|$|E

6000|$|So the {{old woman}} gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a ship which was no bigger than he could put in his pocket, and then she got her eye back, and she went her way and Minnikin his. When he had walked {{on for a long}} time, he met for the third time an old, old crook-backed hag, who had only one eye. This eye also Minnikin stole, and when the woman screamed and lamented, and asked what had become of her eye, Minnikin said, 'What will you give me to get your eye back?' ...|$|E

60|$|I think Stephen's critics {{will admit}} {{that he had a}} good right to be angry, and that they will admire <b>him</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> because he kept his temper. But Mr. Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far.|$|R

6000|$|Ferko {{was at a}} loss to {{understand}} how he could have eaten in his sleep, but he said nothing, and fasted all that day and the next night. But on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears, and implored his brothers to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of their bread. Then the cruel creatures laughed, and repeated what they had said the day before; but when Ferko continued to beg and beseech them, the eldest said at last, 'If you will let us put out one of your eyes and break one of your legs, then we will give you a bit of our bread.' ...|$|E

He is not quite such a nuisance as he was; he has got some backbone and can sit up quite nicely, and he loves his bath now and splashes unsmilingly in the water instead of twisting and shrieking. Oh, shall I ever forget those first two months! I don't know how I lived through them. But here I am and here is Jims and we both are going to 'carry on.' I tickled <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> tonight when I undressed him--I wouldn't bounce him but Morgan doesn't mention tickling--just {{to see if he}} would smile for me as well as Irene. And he did--and out popped the dimples. What a pity his mother couldn't have seen them! ...|$|E
60|$|Well, Ruggles {{wrote the}} letter. At first {{he tried to}} pass it off on me as his own composition. But I know a few little things, {{and one of them}} is that Ruggles couldn't have made up that letter any more than he could have written a sonnet. I told him so, and made him own up. He had a copy of an old letter that had been written to his sister by her young man. I suppose Ruggles had stolen it, but there is no use inquiring too closely into these things. Anyhow, that letter just filled the bill. It was beautifully expressed. Ruggles's sister's young man must have possessed lots of ability. He was an English professor, {{something}} like Micky, so I suppose he was extra good at it. He started in by telling her how much he loved her, and what an angel of beauty and goodness he had always thought her; how unworthy he felt himself of her and how little hope he had that she could ever care for him; and he wound up by imploring her to tell him if she could possibly love <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and all that sort of thing.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the smile}} of one who knew <b>him</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> of one who was just the least mite acquainted with him.

5000|$|Former Dutch {{international}} and Everton manager Ronald Koeman regards Depay as [...] "a great talent", but {{says that he}} must continue his personal development due to the physicality and mental strength needed in the Premier League. Former Wigan Athletic and Portsmouth defender Arjan de Zeeuw stated about Depay, [...] "People regard <b>him</b> as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> arrogant, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> cocky, but I {{think he is a}} very good player, a very promising player, a very strong, very quick player and he's got some skill." ...|$|R

I saved ground on the backside and let <b>him</b> breathe <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> The pace was kind of slow. I asked him at the quarter pole and he came running. He's a very nice horse." ...|$|R

And Moscow returned the favor. The fact that — I would assume they didn’t do a secret meeting or secret found call doesn’t change that." ...|$|R

There was no call for a break away, so we didn't see anything dangerous about the situation. But all of a sudden, all hell seemed to break loose." ...|$|E
50|$|Peter 'Skid' Walker {{was born}} in Yorkshire in October 1912. He really started his racing career in 1935, after linking up with Peter Whitehead. He enjoyed success in both circuit racing and hillclimbing with an ERA prior to World War II, with {{victories}} at Brooklands and Donington Park. Throughout this period, he could be found racing Whitehead's ERAs. His aggressive, sliding style made him a crowd favourite and gained <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of notoriety. After the hostilities finished, {{he returned to the}} sport.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} issues that the animators faced during the {{production}} of Aladdin was the depiction of Aladdin himself.

In design he became more athletic-looking, more filled out, more of a young leading man, more of a teen-hunk version than before."

50|$|Although {{still on}} a {{learning}} {{curve in the}} lower class racing, Paletti decided to join the uncompetitive team Osella in 1982. He admitted that Formula One struck <b>him</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of fear, but his sponsor, Pioneer, wanted him to move up and Paletti {{did not want to}} miss his opportunity. His teammate was the experienced Frenchman driver Jean-Pierre Jarier. He travelled with a personal medical adviser who was monitoring his blood pressure and heartbeat with small sensors attached to his body during testing and practice sessions. His diet was constantly adapted to the results. Few Formula One drivers took this professional approach seriously at the time.|$|R
5000|$|At the time, Protopopescu left Crainic's {{enterprise}} and became manager of Manoilescu's Buna Vestire. Toma Vlădescu also left for Buna Vestire, where he regularly attacked his former mentor and employer.

[...] By then, Sfarmă-Piatrăs allies at Vremea also took distance from Crainic and rallied with Codreanu, accusing the former of [...] "amok" [...] and [...] "megalomania".
