500|$|Shah Rukh Khan {{stated in}} a speech {{delivered}} at the University of Edinburgh that the phrase Chak De! was originally [...] "an inspirational martial cry that Sikh soldiers used while lifting logs {{in order to make}} bridges across rivers on their campaigns against their enemies.

2500|$|The Tsarevich {{was less}} than a month shy of his fourteenth {{birthday}} when he was murdered on 17 July 1918 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The assassination was carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the murder, the family was told to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> dressed {{in the middle of the}} night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei could sit down. When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, [...] "terrified," [...] before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. [...] "Nothing seemed to work," [...] wrote Yurovsky later. [...] "Though injured, he continued to live." [...] Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich's torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head, and he fell silent. Rumors of Alexei's survival began to circulate when the bodies of his family and the royal servants were located. Alexei's was missing, along with that of one of his sisters (generally thought to be Maria or Anastasia). As a result of this, there have been people who have pretended to be the Tsarevich; these people are Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia. The missing bodies were said to have been cremated, though scientists believe it would have been impossible to completely cremate the bodies given the short amount of time and the materials the killing squad had to work with. Numerous searches of the forest surrounding Yekaterinburg up until 2007 failed to turn up the cremation site or the remains of Alexei and his sister.|$|E

"Well now, I {{think that}} instead of giving up the dummy altogether--as we might have done, now that the snow has come on--we must let it float gently down, for seventy or eighty yards; and then throw a stone into the water by it, so as to draw the {{attention}} of the sentry. Or--if the sentries are pretty far apart--one of us might make a great splash in the water, when the dummy is floating; and then run back before the sentry <b>gets</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> into the water quietly, higher up. Their fire will act as a guide to us." ...|$|R

5000|$|Margaret Houlihan takes a nap in her tent. The dream {{sequence}} {{begins with}} the door opening and white light spilling through. Houlihan finds herself in a wedding gown. She steps outside to find herself in an open field with a handsome, dark-haired civilian in a tuxedo, and an ornate bed. She is elated as she and the man kiss {{each other on the}} bed. That is short-lived, however, as a line of soldiers comes along and marches past the bed. The stranger bluntly <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> in line <b>and</b> step with the soldiers. A dismayed Houlihan stares at the departing procession, then turns back to the bed to see a wounded and bloody soldier lying next to her. Soon there are three wounded soldiers.

He names Buddy Guy, Freddie King, Muddy Waters, Albert King, Lightnin' Hopkins and Albert Collins as among his favorite artists. Birchwood attended a Guy concert in Orlando when he was 18.
