5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E
25|$|In human infants, the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> {{is made up}} of 2 α {{chains and}} 2 γ chains. The gamma chains are {{gradually}} replaced by β chains as the infant grows.|$|E
50|$|Hemoglobin A3 is a {{predominantly}} historic {{term for a}} fraction of normal <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> that is seen when hemoglobin is separated out using starch block electrophoresis. These <b>Hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> are non-enzymatic modifications of the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> and they encompass hemoglobinA1c, Hb1a (both the subtypes Hb1a1 and Hb1a2) and Hb1b.|$|R
25|$|When their <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> are deoxygenated, {{red blood}} cells release S-nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels, thus {{directing}} more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.|$|R
50|$|HbA2 {{exists in}} small amounts in all adult humans (1.5-3.1% of all <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules)</b> and is {{approximately}} normal in people with sickle-cell disease. Its biological importance is not yet known.|$|R
25|$|The thalassemias are {{classified}} {{according to which}} chain of the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> is affected. In α-thalassemias, production of the α globin chain is affected, while in β-thalassemia, production of the β globin chain is affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} each <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> to carry oxygen is {{normally}} modified by altered blood pH or CO2, causing an altered oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. However, {{it can also}} be pathologically altered in, e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Hypoxia occurs {{due to the}} {{decreased}} oxygen-binding {{capacity of}} methemoglobin, {{as well as the}} increased oxygen-binding affinity of other subunits in the same <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule,</b> which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{limitations of}} photoacoustic microscopy for detecting optically absorbing molecules are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. We experimentally demonstrate noise-equivalent detection sensitivities of 160, 000 methylene blue molecules (270 zeptomol or 2. 7 × 10 ^(− 19) mol) and 86, 000 oxygenated <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> (140 zeptomol) using narrowband continuous-wave photoacoustics. The ultimate sensitivity of photoacoustics is fundamentally limited by thermal noise, which can {{present in the}} acoustic detection system {{as well as in}} the medium itself. Under the optimized conditions described herein and using commercially available detectors, photoacoustic microscopy can detect as few as 100 s of oxygenated <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules.</b> Realizable improvements to the detector may enable single molecule detection of select molecules...|$|R
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{model is}} {{proposed for the}} interactions between sickle <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> based on information from the protein data bank. A Monte Carlo simulation of a simplified two patch model is carried out, {{with the goal of}} understanding fiber formation. A gradual transition from monomers to one dimensional chains is observed as one varies the density of molecules at fixed temperature, somewhat similar to the transition from monomers to polymer fibers in sickle <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> in solution. An observed competition between chain formation and crystallization for the model is also discussed. The results of the simulation of the equation of state are shown to be in excellent agreement with a theory for a model of globular proteins, for the case of two interacting sites. ...|$|R
25|$|As oxygen binds to one monomer of hemoglobin, the tetramer's {{conformation}} {{shifts from}} the T (tense) {{state to the}} R (relaxed) state. This shift promotes the binding of oxygen to the remaining three monomer's heme groups, thus saturating the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> with oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Montreal artist Nicolas Baier created Lustre (Hémoglobine), a {{sculpture}} in stainless steel {{that shows the}} structure of the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule.</b> It is displayed in the atrium of McGill University Health Centre's research centre in Montreal. The sculpture measures about 10 metres × 10 metres × 10 metres.|$|E
25|$|Once a <b>{{hemoglobin}}</b> <b>molecule</b> is glycated, {{it remains}} that way. A buildup of glycated hemoglobin within the red cell, therefore, reflects the average level of glucose {{to which the}} cell has been exposed during its life-cycle. Measuring glycated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxyhemoglobin to <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> {{in an average}} person may be up to 5%, {{although}} cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{description}} of cooperative binding to a multi-site protein {{was developed by}} A.V. Hill.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the effects of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers on gastrointestinal motility. Diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin reduces sphincter of Oddi trans-sphincteric flow and increases duodenal motility in the Australian brush-tailed possum, effects attributed to nitric oxide (NO) scavenging. Recently, second-generation recombinant <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> with reduced NO scavenging ability have been developed...|$|R
25|$|About 98.5% of {{the oxygen}} {{in a sample}} of {{arterial}} blood in a healthy human, breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with hemoglobin molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{the protein}} makes up about 96% {{of the red}} blood cells' dry content (by weight), and around 35% of the total content (including water). Hemoglobin has an oxygen-binding {{capacity}} of 1.34 mL O2 per gram, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventy-fold compared to dissolved oxygen in blood. The mammalian <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> can bind (carry) up to four oxygen molecules.|$|E
25|$|Glycated {{hemoglobin}} measurement is {{not appropriate}} {{where there has been}} a change in diet or treatment within 6 weeks. Likewise, the test assumes a normal red blood cell aging process and mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence, people with recent blood loss, hemolytic anemia, or genetic differences in the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> (hemoglobinopathy) such as sickle-cell disease and other conditions, as well as those that have donated blood recently, are not suitable for this test.|$|E

25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease is}} a genetic disease that results in {{abnormal}} <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules.</b> When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and viscoelastic meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.|$|R
25|$|In most vertebrates, the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> is an {{assembly}} of four globular protein subunits. Each subunit {{is composed of}} a protein chain tightly associated with a non-protein prosthetic heme group. Each protein chain arranges into a set of alpha-helix structural segments connected together in a globin fold arrangement. Such a name is given because this arrangement is the same folding motif used in other heme/globin proteins such as myoglobin. This folding pattern contains a pocket that strongly binds the heme group.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} either by a decreased amount of hemoglobin molecules, as in anemia, or by decreased ability of each molecule to bind oxygen at the same partial pressure of oxygen. Hemoglobinopathies (genetic defects resulting in abnormal structure of the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule)</b> may cause both. In any case, hemoglobin deficiency decreases blood oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin deficiency is, in general, strictly distinguished from hypoxemia, defined as decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood, although both are causes of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen supply to tissues).|$|E
25|$|Normally, methemoglobin {{levels are}} <1%, as {{measured}} by the co-oximetry test. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against oxidative stress within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe2+) of the heme group of the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> is oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+). This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the molecular nature of cooperative oxygen binding to hemoglobin, it is important to obtain information about the struc-tures of partially oxygenated <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules.</b> Previous applications of the spin-labeling technique (McConnell and McFarland, 1970) to this problem utilized spin labels I and II covalently linked to the fl- 93 eysteine residues of hemoglobin (Ogawa an...|$|R

2500|$|Species of Streptococcus are {{classified}} {{based on their}} hemolytic properties. Alpha-hemolytic species cause oxidization of iron in <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> within red blood cells, giving it a greenish color on blood agar. Beta-hemolytic species cause complete rupture of red blood cells. [...] On blood agar, this appears as wide areas clear of blood cells surrounding bacterial colonies. Gamma-hemolytic species cause no hemolysis.|$|R
25|$|Coordination {{compounds}} have uses in both {{nature and}} in industry. Coordination compounds {{are vital to}} many living organisms. For example, many enzymes are metal complexes, like carboxypeptidase, a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion. This enzyme consists of a zinc ion surrounded by many amino acid residues. Another complex ion enzyme is catalase, which decomposes the cell's waste hydrogen peroxide. This enzyme contains iron-porphyrin complexes, {{similar to those of}} heme in the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule.</b> Chlorophyll contains a magnesium-porphyrin complexes (chlorin), and vitamin B12 is a complex with cobalt and corrin.|$|E
25|$|The blood's {{red color}} {{is due to}} the {{spectral}} properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million of these hemoglobin molecules. Each <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> carries four heme groups; hemoglobin comprises {{about a third of the}} total cell volume. Hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen in the body (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1890s it {{has been}} known that changes in blood flow and blood {{oxygenation}} in the brain (collectively known as hemodynamics) are closely linked to neural activity. When neurons become active, local blood flow to those brain regions increases, and oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood displaces oxygen-depleted (deoxygenated) blood around 2 seconds later. This rises to a peak over 4–6 seconds, before falling {{back to the original}} level (and typically undershooting slightly). Oxygen is carried by the <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecule</b> in red blood cells. Deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) is more magnetic (paramagnetic) than oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), which is virtually resistant to magnetism (diamagnetic). This difference leads to an improved MR signal since the diamagnetic blood interferes with the magnetic MR signal less. This improvement can be mapped to show which neurons are active at a time.|$|E
50|$|Neohemocyte ("new blood cell") is {{the name}} given by its University of California at San Francisco creators to {{artificial}} red blood cells. These cells are created by packing natural <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> in fat bubbles made from phospholipids and cholesterol, resulting in cells roughly one-twelfth the size of human erythrocytes. They provide an advantage over real blood cells in their longer storage capacity (about six months versus 35 days).|$|R
50|$|The {{stages of}} ultrastructural changes of organelles in {{developing}} erythroid cells {{are similar to}} the developmental changes in other vertebrate groups. The greatest difference is the periodical transverse alignment of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> in the organelle matrix of the hemosomes. The transformation of the erythroid cell organelles for hemoglobin biosynthesis occurs slowly. This is due to the low metabolic rate of A. alba which {{is a result of the}} hypoxic environment where it lives.|$|R
5000|$|... 65% of {{the iron}} in the body is bound up in <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>molecules</b> in red blood cells. About 4% is bound up in {{myoglobin}} molecules. Around 30% {{of the iron}} in the body is stored as ferritin or hemosiderin in the spleen, the bone marrow and the liver. Small amounts of iron {{can be found in}} other molecules in cells throughout the body. None of this iron is directly accessible by testing the serum.|$|R
