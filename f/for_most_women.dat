5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
25|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} diving during pregnancy does {{increase the risk}} to the fetus, but to an uncertain extent. As diving is an avoidable risk <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women,</b> the prudent choice is to avoid diving while pregnant. However, if diving is done before pregnancy is recognised, there is generally no indication for concern.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>women,</b> PGP {{resolves}} {{in weeks}} after delivery {{but for some}} it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside. However, some research supports that the average time to complete recovery is 6.25 years, and the more severe the case is, the longer recovery period.|$|E

25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} dihydrotestosterone, is extremely important to normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half {{of what they were}} before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women,</b> those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} spina bifida can be {{prevented}} if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy. Adding folic acid to flour {{has been found to}} be effective <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women.</b> Open spina bifida can be surgically closed before or after birth. A shunt may be needed in those with hydrocephalus, and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired. Devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful. Urinary catheterization may also be needed.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} an {{adjuvant}} treatment <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> who have undergone lumpectomy {{and for some}} women who have mastectomy surgery. In these cases the purpose of radiation {{is to reduce the}} chance that the cancer will recur locally (within the breast or axilla). Radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays or gamma rays that target a tumor or post surgery tumor site. This radiation is very effective in killing cancer cells that may remain after surgery or recur where the tumor was removed.|$|E

25|$|Family law favoured men, {{and women}} are {{particularly}} vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights, {{as well as in}} the general protection of civil rights. Women have very limited access to legal services due to their lack of education and information, as well as the prohibitive cost. For example, if a woman wants a divorce, she has to pay approximately $60 (28,000 CFA francs) to start the process, a prohibitive amount <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that, <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women,</b> high {{sex drive}} {{is associated with}} increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation. Similarly for most bisexual women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men; while for bisexual men, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex, and weakened attraction to the other.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

25|$|The thali is {{an emblem}} {{shaped like a}} leaf and which is worn as a necklace. The wearing {{of it has been}} {{compared}} to a wedding ring as <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> in south India it denotes that they are married. The thalikettu kalyanam was the ritual during which the thali would be tied on a piece of string around the neck of a Nair girl. If the girl should reach puberty before the ceremony took place then she would in theory have been out-caste, although it is probable that this stricture was not in fact observed.|$|E
25|$|Montalvo was {{originally}} instructed {{to write her}} vita in 1636 by her confessor, Cosimo Pazzi. It was typical for catholic confessors to instruct women to write spiritual autobiographies or vita. These scittura segreta (secret writing) {{were meant to be}} analyzed by confessors so that they could better meet the woman’s spiritual needs. Montalvo worked on her vita for 23 years. She began in 1636 (age 34) and continued to work on it until her death in 1659. This was not common <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women.</b> Women were often commanded to write extensive accounts of their entire spiritual life and were given very little time. Once completed these accounts would be confiscated immediately and would sometimes be used to condemn the female authors as heretics.|$|E
25|$|A major {{complaint}} among {{postmenopausal women}} is decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this. Several hormonal changes take {{place during the}} menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels {{and an increase in}} follicle-stimulating hormone. <b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>women,</b> the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages. Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition. However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Yasuda joined Toei Doga in April 1958, {{immediately}} after her graduation from high school. Yasuda {{has said that}} she applied not knowing what the job entailed but that she had submitted her application {{because she did not}} fancy employment in any of the other jobs available <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> at the time, such as bank teller or store clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned up line drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Lucrezia Borgia {{was born}} at Subiaco, near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, one of the mistresses of Lucrezia's father, Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI). Lucrezia Borgia's {{education}} was entrusted to Adriana Orsini de Milan, a close confidant of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) during her early life. Her education would primarily {{take place in the}} Piazza Pizzo de Merlo, a building adjacent to her fathers residence. Her education is common for a woman of her social stature, but uncommon for someone of her gender. Unlike educated women of her time her ascension came from within the sphere of intellectuals in court and close relatives. <b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> who wanted to be educated, convents were the primary source for knowledge. Her upbringing would differentiate to others due to the inclusion of Humanities, which the Catholic Church at the time considered detrimental to the foundations of piety and obedience. This education would be successful in teaching Lucrezia; Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and some dominance of Latin and Greek. She would also become proficient in the lute, poetry, and oration. The biggest testament is her capability in administration, as later on in life she would take care of Vatican City correspondence and governance of Ferrara.|$|E
2500|$|Self-sufficiency in {{clothing}} paid off. The carding, combing, {{spinning and}} weaving of wool {{were part of}} daily housekeeping <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women.</b> Those of middling or low income could supplement their personal or family income by spinning and selling yarn, or by weaving fabric for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family's wool-baskets, spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area [...] (atrium), where the mater familias and her familia could thus demonstrate their industry and frugality; a largely symbolic and moral activity, rather than practical necessity. Augustus was particularly proud that {{his wife and daughter}} had set the best possible example to other Roman women by spinning and weaving his clothing. High-caste brides were expected to make their own wedding garments, using a traditional vertical loom.|$|E
50|$|In Louisiana, {{the setting}} <b>for</b> The Awakening, <b>most</b> <b>women</b> {{at the time}} were their husbands' legal property; being a largely Catholic state, divorce was {{extremely}} rare, and women were expected to stay loyal and faithful to their husbands, and men to their wives. This explains some reactions The Awakening received in 1899.|$|R
50|$|At a young age, to beautify {{themselves}} <b>for</b> marriage, <b>most</b> <b>women</b> {{have their}} bottom teeth removed and their bottom lips pierced, then stretched, {{so as to}} allow insertion of a clay lip plate. Some women have stretched their lips so as to allow plates up to sixteen inches in diameter. Increasing with exposure to other cultures, however, {{a growing number of}} girls now refrain from this practice. Their children are sometimes painted with white clay paint, which may be dotted on the face or body.|$|R
40|$|Cancer and its link to {{reproductive}} hormones {{is an area}} {{of intense}} concern for our patients and {{has been the subject of}} much speculation. But if estrogen causes breast cancer, <b>for</b> example, <b>most</b> <b>women</b> would eventually develop the disease. We know this is not the case! Actually, estrogen and progesterone have been linked to a decrease as well as an increase in cancer, depending upon the type of tumor under investigation. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the data supporting those relationships...|$|R
2500|$|Girls {{of noble}} {{families}} were taught in nunneries such as Elcho, Aberdour and Haddington. By {{the end of}} the fifteenth century Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as [...] "sewing schools", whose name probably indicates one of their major functions, although reading may also have been taught in these schools. The students were probably taught by lay women or nuns. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, which may have extended to women, but <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> educational opportunities remained extremely limited. The major corpus of Medieval Scottish Gaelic poetry, The Book of the Dean of Lismore is notable for containing poetry by at least four women. These include Aithbhreac Nighean Coirceadail (f. 1460), who wrote a lament for her husband, the constable of Castle Sween.|$|E

Private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers may have extended to women, but <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>women</b> educational opportunities remained extremely limited. Despite this there is evidence of female Gaelic poets. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service, with many young people, both male and female, leaving home to become domestic and agricultural servants, followed by relatively late marriage. Women retained their original surname at marriage and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, by the end of the period most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. There was no divorce, but separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Mount Saint Canice {{had similar}} {{conditions}} to those {{shown in the}} 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters, {{written and directed by}} Peter Mullan. Girls as young as eleven were turned over to the Good Shepherd sisters. While there was a school at Mount Saint Canice, the curriculum was very basic. These younger girls were also forced to work in the laundry.
