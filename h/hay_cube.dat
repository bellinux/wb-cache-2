40|$|Two {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to investigate the}} feeding effect of alcoholic apple pomace silages (APSs) on performance traits, ruminal pH and blood variables in sheep. In experiment 1, four ewes were fed alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>cube</b> and either APS (ethanol content was 33. 4 g /kg DM) or concentrate (control) {{at a ratio of}} 30 : 70 of TDN requirement for maintenance and daily 100 g gain in a 2 × 2 crossover design over two 35 -day periods. Total body weight gain was higher in control treatment. No significant treatment effect was observed for TDN intake and ruminal pH. Plasma concentrations of ethanol, lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) were increased after feeding APS. Plasma insulin, glucose, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) were not significantly differ between the treatments. The area upper or under curves (AUCs) of plasma ethanol and BHBA were greater and lactate was tended to greater in APS treatment. In experiment 2, low and high ethanol contained APSs (L-APS, 44. 1 g and H-APS, 66. 9 g of ethanol/kg DM) were compared in the same design (Experiment 1). No significant treatment effect was observed for body weight gain and TDN intake. Pre-feeding ruminal pH was lower in L-APS treatment. Insulin concentration was slightly higher in L-APS treatment. However, no significant treatment effect was detected for other variables. According to the consistent increase in plasma ethanol, lactate and BHBA, and the plasma AUCs response of ethanol, lactate and BHBA after feeding of alcoholic-fermented APSs, it would be concluded that APS ethanol consumption affect the post prandial blood metabolism as well as influenced the plasma lactate and BHBA concentrations in the blood...|$|E

Three ponies were offered 4 kg dry matter (DM) per day of either 100 % <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> (HC), or one of three diets consisting of a 50 : 50 barley:HC mix. Due to small refusals of HC, the actual DM intakes (kg per day) were 3. 74, 3. 67, 3. 57 and 3. 52 (S. E. D. 0. 18) for the HC, RB:HC, MB:HC and EB:HC diets, respectively. With the exception of butyrate, all intra-caecal fermentation parameters 4 - 8 h post feeding in ponies given diet RB:HC were significantly (P< 0. 05) different from those observed in ponies fed diet HC. Thus, in ponies fed diet RB:HC, intra-caecal pH and acetate molar proportions were reduced whilst lactate concentration and propionate molar proportions were increased (P< 0. 05) compared with values recorded in ponies fed diet HC. By contrast, intra-caecal total VFA, lactate and pH levels of ponies fed diets MB:HC or EB:HC {{were similar to those}} in ponies fed HC at all time points measured, although acetate and propionate molar proportions were lower and higher, respectively, in ponies fed diets EB:HC and MB:HC compared with those fed HC. These results suggest that micronisation or extrusion of barley offer advantages over rolling barley in that the values for the intra-caecal fermentation parameters in ponies fed MB:HC or EB:HC were largely similar to those of ponies fed the HC forage diet.

40|$|Heat {{production}} in ruminants follows a diurnal pattern {{over the course}} of a day peaking 3 hours following afternoon feeding and then gradually declining to its lowest point prior to morning feeding. In order to clarify the cooling period most effective in reducing decreases in feed intake and milk production, experiments were carried out based on the diurnal rhythm of heat production and heat dissipation. In experiment 1, the effects of hot environment on milk production were investigated. The animals were kept first in a thermoneutral environment (20. 0 °C, 80. 0 %) for 12 days, they were then transitioned to a hot environment (32 °C, 80. 0 %) for 13 days before being returned to second thermoneutral environment for a further 12 days. In experiment 2, the effectiveness of daytime cooling or nighttime cooling for improving milk {{production in}} hot environment was compared. While ten lactating Japanese Saanen goats (aged 2 years, weighing 41. 0 kg) during early lactation were used in experiment 1, ten lactating goats (aged 2 years, weighing 47. 5 kg) during mid-lactation were used in experiment 2. The animals were fed 300 g of concentrated feed and excessive amounts of crushed alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> twice daily. Water was given ad libitum. The animals were milked twice daily. When exposed to a hot environment, milk yield and composition decreased significantly (p< 0. 05). Milk yield in the hot environment did not change with daytime cooling, but tended to increase with nighttime cooling. Compared to the daytime cooling, milk components percentages in the nighttime cooling were not significantly different but the milk components yields in the nighttime cooling were significantly higher (p< 0. 05).

Two experiments were conducted comparing energy and nitrogen partitioning in mid-lactation, in Holstein-Friesian cows selected for high or low RFI measured previously as growing calves. Each experiment used 16 cows (8 high-RFI and 8 low-RFI); the first used primiparous (PP) cows and the second used multiparous (MP) cows. Cows were housed individually for 4 days in metabolism stalls, then open-circuit respiration chambers for 3 days. Each cow was offered ad libitum lucerne <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> plus 6 kg DM per day of crushed wheat grain. Individual feed intake, milk yield, milk composition and faecal and urine output were measured. Methane and carbon dioxide output and oxygen consumption were measured in the chambers. In MP cows, a greater proportion of energy intake was partitioned to milk and less to heat in low-RFI than high-RFI cows. The proportion of gross-energy intake per kilogram metabolic bodyweight partitioned to milk production was greater and the proportion partitioned to methane and heat production was lower in MP than in PP cows. Energy from tissue mobilisation was not affected by RFI or parity. The amount of nitrogen consumed from feed was greater in MP than PP cows. As a percentage of N intake, N partitioned to milk was greater in PP than in MP cows, but there were no overall effects of RFI on N partitioning. However, there was a trend towards a positive association between N excreted in the urine and RFI, which could have environmental implications. Both RFI and parity were associated with variation in energy and nitrogen partitioning and should be examined in a larger subset of animals in future...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of social relationships on the feed intake, eating behavior, and growth, upon exposure to a novel diet, in Hanwoo (Bos taurus coreanae) heifers during pregnancy. Twenty-four pregnant Hanwoo heifers, averaging 438 ± 27. 8 kg in weight, 21 months in age, and 194 ± 8. 5 days in pregnancy, were involved in a two-month (eight weeks) experiment. The heifers were randomly assigned to either the single housing group (SG; one individual per pen, n = 12), or the paired housing group (PG; two individuals per pen, n = 12). All pens were of the same size (5 × 5 m) and provided with one feed bin, which automatically recorded the individual feed intake and eating behavior. As the experiment began, the diet of the heifers was switched from a total mixed ration (TMR; 250 g/kg ryegrass straw and 750 g/kg concentrate mix) to a forage-only diet (mixed <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> composed of 500 g/kg alfalfa, 250 g/kg timothy, and 250 g/kg blue grass hay). The heifers were fed ad libitum twice a day. The individual feed intake and eating behavior were recorded daily throughout the experiment, and body weights (BWs) were measured every four weeks before the morning feeding. PG animals visited the feed bin 22 % less often than SG. PG, however, stayed 39 % longer in the feed bin and consumed 40 % more feed per visit, compared with SG. Consequently, PG heifers spent 23 % more time in eating and had 16 % more daily dry matter intake than SG during the experiment. Average daily gain during the experimental period tended to be greater in PG than in SG. When pregnant Hanwoo heifers encountered a novel diet, social relationships (i. e., presence of a pen-mate) enhanced their time spent eating and feed intake. Social interactions, even with an unfamiliar individual, may be helpful for pregnant Hanwoo heifers cope with a diet challenge compared to solitary situation...|$|R

Eighteen male kids were divided into three groups of six animals (control feed group (CFG), Awamori-pressed lees mixed feed group (AMFG), Tofu lees mixed feed group (TMFG)). The CFG used feed containing 20 % soybean meal as the main protein source, while the AMFG and TMFG used feed mixed with 20 % dried Awamori-pressed lees or dried Tofu lees. The groups were fed mixed feed (volume to provide 100 g/d increase in body weight) and alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> (2. 0 kg/d) twice a day (10 : 00, 16 : 00). Klein grass hay and water was given ad libitum. Hay intake was measured at 10 : 00 and 16 : 00. Body weight and size measurements were taken once a month. At the end of the experiment, a blood sample was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal and the carcass characteristics, the physical and chemical characteristics of loin were analyzed. DCP and TDN intakes in AMFG and TMFG showed no significant difference to the CFG. Cumulative measurements of growth in body weight and size over the 10 mo period in the AMFG and TMFG were similar to the CFG. Blood parameter values were similar to those in normal goats. Dressing carcass weight and percentages, and total weight of meat in the AMFG were similar to that in the CFG, but smaller in the TMFG. The compressed meat juice ratio was higher in both the TMFG and AMFG than the CFG. While the fat in corn, Awamori-pressed lees, and Tofu lees contains more than 50 % linoleic acid, the loin fat in both the AMFG and TMFG was very low in linoleic acid due to the increase in the content of oleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid. This indicates that feeding on AMF and TMF does not inhibit hydrogenation by ruminal microorganisms. As in the CFG, the total essential and non-essential amino acids in the loin of the AMFG and TMFG were well balanced. Compared to the CFG, the AMFG and TMFG were high in taurine and carnosine.

40|$|In large-type goats {{that were}} fed on dry forage twice daily, dry forage intake was {{markedly}} suppressed after 40 min of feeding had elapsed. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether or not marked decreases in dry forage intake after 40 min of feeding are mainly caused by the two factors, that is, ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality induced thirst produced by dry forage feeding. Six large-type male esophageal- and ruminal-fistulated goats (crossbred Japanese Saanen/Nubian, aged 2 to 6 years, weighing 85. 1 ± 4. 89 kg) were used in two experiments. The animals were fed ad libitum a diet of roughly crushed alfalfa <b>hay</b> <b>cubes</b> for 2 h from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 am during two experiments. Water was withheld during feeding in both experiments but was available for a period of 30 min after completion of the 2 h feeding period. In experiment 1, saliva lost via the esophageal fistula was replenished by an intraruminal infusion of artificial parotid saliva (RIAPS) in sham feeding conditions (SFC) control, and the treatment was maintained under normal feeding conditions (NFC). In experiment 2, a RIAPS and non-insertion of a balloon (RIAPS-NB) control was conducted in the same manner as the SFC control of experiment 1. The intraruminal infusion of hypertonic solution and insertion of a balloon (RIHS-IB) treatment was carried out simultaneously to reproduce the effects of changing salt content and ruminal distension due to feed entering the rumen. The results of experiment 1 showed that due to the effects of multiple dry forage suppressing factors when feed boluses entered the rumen, eating rates in the NFC treatment decreased (p< 0. 05) after 40 min of feeding and cumulative dry forage intake for the 2 h feeding period reduced to 43. 8 % of the SFC control (p< 0. 01). The results of experiment 2 indicated that due to the two suppressing factors of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality induced thirst, eating rates in the RIHS-IB treatment were, as observed under NFC, reduced (p< 0. 05) and cumulative dry forage intake for the 2 h feeding period decreased to 34. 0 % of the RIAPS-NB control (p< 0. 01). The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 5 % of the suppression of dry forage intake 40 min after the start of dry forage feeding. The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality induced thirst are the main factors in the suppression of dry forage intake in large-type goats...|$|R

Cattle can be finished on diets varying widely in the proportions of grain and roughage. Until recently, economists theorized a decreasing marginal rate of substitution between concen-trate and forage to achieve the same level of gain, as represented by convex isoquants (Brokken et al.; Brokken 1977; Epplin, Bhide, and Heady 1983). This theoretical view con-tends that the optimum balance of forage and grain is very sensitive to small shifts in the ratios of ingredient prices. Yet, diets in com-mercial feedlots typically have contained only minimum amounts of roughage to satisfy physiological needs, and very large increases in the grain-to-forage price ratio are required to force movement to higher forage based diets (Brokken 1976).

40|$|Objective: To {{report on}} {{spontaneous}} clinical and subclinical acidosis {{in a large}} dairy herd, to evaluate the diets and feeding strategies involved, and to report on measures of rumen function in the cows affected. Design: A Gippsland dairy herd was sampled {{as part of a}} wider randomised cross-sectional study that examined the prevalence, risk factors for, and effects of, acidosis on rumen function of dairy cattle. Three herds on the farm were involved in the study: the transition herd (cows 3 weeks prior to calving), the very fresh lactating herd (1 <days in milk< 10, herd 1) and the fresh lactating herd (10 <days in milk< 120, herd 2) including a small lame herd fed separately. The transition cows were fed 2 kg dry matter triticale per cow per day and hay with an estimated total dry matter intake of 4. 8 kg per cow per day. The lactating cow diet included 6. 75 kg dry matter triticale per cow per day with total concentrate fed being 8. 1 kg dry matter per cow per day in the milking parlour. Silage, lucerne <b>cubes,</b> <b>hay</b> and pasture (herd 2 only) was also fed to the lactating cows with the estimated total dry matter intake for cows in herds 1 and 2 being 13. 7 kg and 20. 8 kg per cow per day respectively. Three primiparous and five multiparous cows in early lactation (< 100 days in milk) were randomly selected from each of two lactating herds: herds 1 and 2. Rumen fluid was sampled from each cow by both rumenocentesis and stomach tube. The rumenocentesis samples were tested for pH at the time of sampling. Stomach tube samples were frozen and subsequently tested for volatile fatty acid, ammonia, and D- and L-lactate concentration. Results: In the very fresh herd, there was a high prevalence of severe lameness and scouring, coupled with a mean rumen pH 5. 67, low mean total volatile fatty acid concentration 71. 0 mM and high mean concentrations of L- and D-lactate, (7. 71 mM and 7. 31 mM), respectively. Cows in the fresh herd had moderate signs of scouring and lameness. A lame herd comprising approximately 50 cows separated from the fresh herd was also present on the farm. The mean rumen pH of the fresh herd was 5. 74 and mean rumen concentrations of volatile fatty acids, ammonia, L- and D-lactate were within ranges considered normal. Conclusions: The transition diet failed to supply sufficient energy and protein for maintenance of cows of this live weight in late gestation. The diet fed to the very fresh herd was low in effective fibre and contained an excessive content of non-structural carbohydrate in the form of processed, rapidly fermentable grain. The sudden change from the transition diet to the diet fed to the very fresh herd probably also precipitated the outbreak of acidosis.
