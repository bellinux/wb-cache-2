40|$|The Livingstone-Vallentyne piston sampler {{has been}} further {{modified}} by replacing the spring catch with splines on a square rod, {{in order to}} strengthen the critical points of greatest stress and permit pounding when necessary. Biostratigraphic studies of Quaternary peats and lake sediments were developed to a high degree in Scandinavia nd elsewhere in north-western Europe {{with the benefit of}} open expo-sures of peat or {{with the use of the}} Hiller sampler, which sweeps a sample sideways into a tube (Fries and Hafsten, 1965). Hiller samples are subject to contamination during collection, disturbance of the sedimentary structures, and the easy freezing of the mechanism in very cold weather. The sediment must be sub-sampled in the field, for it is impossible, or at best very difficult, to extract and store an entire core for future reference. Despite these shortcomings the Hiller sampler is still the most commonly used peat and lake-sediment sampler in Europe, perhaps because it may be the only commercially available hand-operated tool of any reputation.

40|$|The faunal {{communities}} of four intertidal habitats namely sand, mud, seagrass (Zostera noltii) and seagrass patches (mixSM) of a temperate coastal lagoon, Ria Formosa (southern Portugal), were sampled. A total of 47 species {{were taken in}} 428 bottomless <b>drop</b> <b>sampler</b> samples, with {{the highest number of}} species and the more commonly occurring species belonging to the Mollusca phylum. The dominance of these gastropod species underlines the importance of the grazing food chain in these habitats. Bittium reticulatum was the most abundant species, being especially abundant in the seagrass habitat. The most frequent and highest biomass species in the community was Carcinus maenas, a predator that makes use of the available resources and that is adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment. Pomatoschistus microps was the most abundant fish species, with highest densities in the mud habitat, which demonstrates an ability to occupy a low depth area. The seagrass; habitat had the highest diversity, abundance and biomass, followed by the mixSM habitat and was different from all the others. Assemblages were highly influenced by the presence of vegetation, providing forage and refuge from predation. A well defined summer group was identified in all habitats. These results highlight the importance of seagrass beds and the idea that their decrease implies the decrease of lagoon production through the impoverishment of the trophic structure of the lagoon.

40|$|Abstract: Terracing is a {{relatively}} new wetland-restoration technique used to convert shallow subtidal bot-tom to marsh. This method uses existing bottom sediments to form terraces or ridges at marsh elevation. A terrace field is constructed by arranging these ridges in some pattern that maximizes intertidal edge and minimizes fetch between ridges; the intertidal area is planted with marsh vegetation. We examined the habitat value of terracing for fishery species at Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana (USA) in spring and fall 1999 by quantifying and comparing nekton densities in a 9 -yr-old terrace field and nearby reference area using a 1 -m 2 <b>drop</b> <b>sampler.</b> Decapod crustaceans were more abundant than fishes, composing 62 % and 95 % of all organisms we collected in spring and fall, respectively. White shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus, dagger-blade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus accounted for 94 % of all crustaceans, whereas 60 % of all fishes were gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus. Mean densities of white shrimp (fall), daggerblade grass shrimp, blue crab, and brown shrimp (spring) were significantly greater in terrace marsh than on non-vegetated bottom in the reference pond. Densities of most nekton on non-vegetated bottom were similar in the terrace field and the reference pond, but gulf menhaden and white shrimp had higher densities at terrace pond sites and brown shrimp (spring) were more abundant at reference pond sites. The pattern for biomass was similar to that for density in tha...|$|E
40|$|Torpedograss (Panicum repens) is a {{non-indigenous}} perennial {{species of}} rhizomatous graminaceous grass that currently persists along {{the majority of}} the vegetated shoreline of Lake Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas. For this study, invertebrate and fish assemblages associated with varying densities of torpedograss were studied seasonally from fall 2015 through summer 2016. Fish assemblages were sampled through the use of exhaustive electrofishing within blocknetted areas containing torpedograss. Invertebrates were sampled using a <b>drop</b> <b>sampler,</b> which was used to collect standardized samples of invertebrates from the water column, torpedograss vegetation, and benthos. Diet composition of piscivorous and insectivorous fishes were also observed. All fish species collected that comprised at least 2 % {{of the total number of}} fishes, with exception to largemouth bass, were low dissolved oxygen tolerant species. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for length frequency for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Microperus salmoides), and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) showed no significant difference in length frequency distributions across torpedograss densities; however, significant differences were observed for largemouth bass and western mosquitofish based on seasonality. With regards to invertebrates, a canonical correspondence analysis showed that torpedograss density and weight had the strongest positive correlation (pseudo-F = 25. 9, p-value = 0. 002) to taxa composition and densities, representing 43. 6 % of explained variation. Season and location of taxa within the water column each had a significant positive correlation to the number and diversity of invertebrate taxa and represented 15. 8 % and 42. 4 % of explained variation respectively (pseudo-F = 13. 0, p-value = 0. 002), (pseudo-F = 49. 0, p-value = 0. 002). The most common invertebrate taxa found within fish diets were also the most common taxa found within torpedograss patches, and chironomid larvae consistently had the highest frequency of occurrence and prey-specific abundance in bluegill, largemouth bass, and golden topminnows (Fundulus chrysotus). With regards to fishes, a redundancy analysis showed that torpedograss density and weight had the strongest positive correlation (pseudo-F = 5. 1, p-value = 0. 002) to fish taxa composition and densities, representing 61. 8 % of explained variation. Season combined with torpedograss density had a significant positive correlation to the number and diversity of invertebrate taxa and represented 28. 4 % of explained variation respectively (pseudo-F = 1. 7, p-value = 0. 09). Stable isotope analysis supports the use of torpedograss as a foraging location, as the ?^ 13 C (?) values for the largemouth bass, bluegill, and western mosquitofish were all similar, and correlated to the ?^ 13 C (?) value of the invertebrates and periphyton tested. The ?^ 13 C (?) value of torpedograss is relatively close to that of the western mosquitofish, suggesting that the western mosquitofish at some point in its life could be consuming torpedograss itself. These findings provide insight into the fish and invertebrate communities that are utilizing torpedograss as habitat and a potential foraging location. As such, management, rather than eradication, of torpedograss may be preferable when making fisheries management decisions...|$|E

We show that the optimal solution is a linear combination of the discrete prolates. The last compensation technique we develop is an iterative solution in class of projection-onto-convex-sets. We develop the algorithm and prove that it converges to the optimal solution found using constrained minimization.

In Japan, {{there is very little}} information regarding carriage of STEC 2 f by pigeons, prompting the need for further investigation. We collected 549 samples of pigeon droppings from 14 locations in Kyushu, Japan, to isolate STEC 2 f and to investigate characteristics of the isolates. Shiga toxin stx 2 f gene fragments were detected by PCR in 16 (2. 9 %) of the 549 <b>dropping</b> <b>samples</b> across four of the 14 locations. We obtained 23 STEC 2 f-isolates from seven of the original samples and from three pigeon <b>dropping</b> <b>samples</b> collected in an additional sampling experiment (from a total of seven locations across both sampling periods). Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics were then examined for selected isolates from each of 10 samples with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. Eight of the stx 2 f gene fragments sequenced in this study were homologous to others that were identified in Europe. Some isolates also contained virulence-related genes, including lpfA O 26, irp 2, and fyuA, and all of the 10 selected isolates maintained the eae, astA, and cdt genes. Moreover, five of the 10 selected isolates contained sfpA, a gene that is restricted to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O 165 :H 2 and sorbitol-fermenting Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O 157 :NM. We document serotypes O 152 :HNM, O 128 :HNM, and O 145 :H 34 as STEC 2 f, which agrees with previous studies on pigeons and humans. Interestingly, O 119 :H 21 was newly described as STEC 2 f. O 145 :H 34, with sequence type 722, was described in a German study in humans and was also isolated in the current study.
