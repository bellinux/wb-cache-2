5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons. They typically appear {{in the form of}} 12-60 second cartoons that are filled with <b>gratuitous</b> violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor. Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or <b>gratuitous</b> titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently <b>gratuitous</b> nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} panned by {{mainstream}} critics, particularly {{for what they}} saw as its weak script and <b>gratuitous</b> violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing the film as unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Due to the commercial success of the film, which was planned as the first part of a series, its sequel is currently in development.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a <b>gratuitous</b> gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|Its {{writing was}} {{consistently}} praised by reviewers. The narrative was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade content. Eurogamer {{said that it}} had the best script the website had ever seen in a video game, and others {{described it as a}} superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being <b>gratuitous</b> or exploitative, and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with <b>gratuitous</b> friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for {{being one of}} the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting <b>gratuitous</b> violence and sexual aggression against women. Toy retailers pulled the game from shelves that December, and Sega withdrew the game from the market by January. The Senate hearing eventually {{led to the creation of}} the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held {{a hearing}} on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured <b>gratuitous</b> violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended to look very unrealistic to mitigate the violence. Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.|$|E
25|$|Challenge {{of gifts}} (Schenkungsanfechtung / cas de libéralités): <b>Gratuitous</b> or {{effectively}} <b>gratuitous</b> transfers of assets by the debtor may be challenged if they took place {{within a year}} prior to the seizure of assets or the bankruptcy. Good-faith recipients of a gift must return it {{only to the extent}} that they remain enriched by it.|$|E
25|$|It is agreed {{between the}} High Contracting Parties that the exemptions, privileges, or {{concessions}} {{which they may}} obtain from the Government of Paraguay, shall be common to all gratuitously, if they be <b>gratuitous,</b> and with the same compensation if they be conditional.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{acquisitions}} tax {{is charged}} to {{the recipient of}} gifts or inheritances, {{at the rate of}} 33% above a tax-free threshold. Gifts and inheritances are <b>gratuitous</b> benefits; the difference is that an inheritance is taken on death and a gift is taken other than on death.|$|E
25|$|After {{successive}} name {{changes and}} {{a plethora of}} highly influential dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as the KLF, the biggest-selling singles act {{in the world for}} 1991, still incorporating the work of other artists but in less <b>gratuitous</b> ways and predominantly without legal problems.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Mineo {{returned}} to the stage to direct a Los Angeles production of the LGBT-themed play Fortune and Men's Eyes (1967), featuring then-unknown Don Johnson as Smitty and himself as Rocky. The production received positive reviews, although its expanded prison rape scene was criticized as excessive and <b>gratuitous.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rights to}} show the film on TV were {{eventually}} purchased by the VH1 network. However, because of the film's rampant and <b>gratuitous</b> nudity, a censored version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed breasts and genitalia. Also, several scenes were removed entirely. Berkley refused to re-dub her lines, so a noticeably different actress's voice can be heard on the soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 presidential {{election}} debates included mentions of the same-sex marriage debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards mentioned and praised Cheney's openness {{with regard to}} her sexual orientation when questioned regarding gay issues. Some commentators viewed these remarks as a <b>gratuitous,</b> cynical appeal to residual homophobia among blue-collar voters in key swing states.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that the Reverend Delman L. Coates and his organization Enough is Enough led protests every weekend outside the residences of BET executives against what they claim are negative stereotypes of black people perpetuated by BET music videos. Enough is Enough backed an April 2008 report titled The Rap on Rap by the Parents Television Council that claimed that BET's rap programming, which they believed contained <b>gratuitous</b> sexual, violent and profane content, was targeting children and teens.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, John Hammond, {{who also}} mentored Billie Holiday, asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been {{acquired}} by Columbia Records in 1925). He {{claimed to have}} found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia. Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond {{was known for his}} selective memory and <b>gratuitous</b> embellishments.|$|E
25|$|Lubbock {{had been}} {{as much of an}} ethnologist as an archaeologist. The founders of {{cultural}} anthropology, such as Tylor and Morgan, were to follow his lead on that. Lubbock created such concepts as savages and barbarians based on the customs of then modern tribesmen and made the presumption that the terms can be applied without serious inaccuracy to the men of the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Childe broke with this view:The assumption that any savage tribe today is primitive, in the sense that its culture faithfully reflects that of much more ancient men is <b>gratuitous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anastasia's own brutal actions soon {{created a}} {{favorable}} climate in New York for his removal. In 1952, Anastasia ordered {{the murder of}} a Brooklyn man Arnold Schuster who had aided in the capture of bank robber Willie Sutton. Anastasia did not like the fact that Schuster had helped the police. The New York families were outraged by this <b>gratuitous</b> killing that raised a large amount of public furor. Anastasia also alienated one of Luciano's powerful associates, Meyer Lansky, by opening casinos in Cuba to compete with Lansky's. Genovese and Lansky soon recruited Carlo Gambino to the conspiracy by offering him the chance to replace Anastasia and become boss himself.|$|E
25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a <b>gratuitous</b> promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|While {{the sport}} has {{its origins in}} the banked-track roller skating marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are {{credited}} with the basic evolution of the sport to its initial competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports entertainment where the theatrical elements overshadowed the athleticism. This <b>gratuitous</b> showmanship largely ended with the sport's contemporary grassroots revival {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century. Although some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms were retained, scripted bouts with predetermined winners were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, BWG Foods, {{operators}} of the SPAR brand in Ireland, invested €900,000 in a three-year deal to have SPAR appear in Fair City. The new shop, formerly Christy Phelan's corner shop, was unveiled in an episode broadcast on 6 December 2011. It was RTÉ's first high-profile product placement deal, {{and followed the}} Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's decision to allow paid product placement on Irish television, in line with relaxed EU regulations. There are 450 SPAR outlets in the Republic of Ireland. RTÉ was obliged to inform viewers before each episode aired it contained product placement. RTÉ said that Fair Citys editor-in-chief would ensure there were no <b>gratuitous</b> references or prominence given to Spar that would not happen anyway.|$|E
25|$|The band {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's <b>Gratuitous</b> Sax & Senseless Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|This did {{not prevent}} another Houston-area defendant, former Dynegy natural gas trader Michelle Valencia, from {{undergoing}} a perp walk in 2003. After waiting all day for the indictment, her attorney told prosecutors she would return there the next morning. Instead, she was arrested at her home before the courthouse opened. Her attorney said prosecutors were bullying her for refusing to cooperate with them. Similarly, lawyers for Adelphia Communications chairman John Rigas criticized prosecutors for having him arrested at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side in 2002 despite his offer to surrender. Defense lawyers have been advised, if they are aware an indictment and arrest is imminent, to announce to the media that their client will surrender {{at a particular time}} in the near future, making a subsequent arrest and perp walk seem <b>gratuitous.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tchaikovsky {{considered}} his next ballet, The Sleeping Beauty, {{one of his}} finest works, according to Brown. The structure of the scenario proved more successful than that of Swan Lake. While the prologue and first two acts contain {{a certain number of}} set dances, they are not designed for <b>gratuitous</b> choreographic decoration but have at least some marginal relevance to the main plot. These dances are also far more striking than their counterparts in Swan Lake, as several of them are character pieces from fairy tales such as Puss in Boots and Little Red Riding Hood, which elicited a far more individualized type of invention from the composer. Likewise, the musical ideas in these sections are more striking, pointed and precise. This characterful musical invention, combined with a structural fluency, a keen feeling for atmosphere and a well-structured plot, makes The Sleeping Beauty perhaps Tchaikovsky's most consistently successful ballet.|$|E
25|$|During the Whitewater {{investigation}} in the 1990s, Susan McDougal, held in contempt for refusing to testify before special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury, was perp-walked wearing leg irons and a waist chain as well as handcuffs, which she wore over an ensemble consisting of a jacket, white blouse, miniskirt, black stockings and high heels. Starr was criticized for what {{was seen as a}} <b>gratuitous</b> attempt to humiliate an uncooperative witness. He claimed his office {{had nothing to do with}} the level of restraint she wore, and the marshals' service said that was standard for all prisoners in transit. In 1995 Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, already in Oklahoma Highway Patrol custody for a firearms violation, was paraded before television cameras by the FBI nearly three hours before he was officially arrested for the bombing. His lawyers later asked to have eyewitness identifications of him excluded from evidence, on the grounds that they were all based on the widely televised perp walk and none of the witness had been asked to pick him out of a lineup.|$|E
25|$|In {{a limited}} number of cases, an {{agreement}} will be unenforceable unless it meets a certain form prescribed by statute. While contracts can be generally made without formality, some transactions are thought to require form either because it makes a person think carefully before they bind themselves to an agreement, or merely that it serves as clear evidence. This goes typically for large engagements, including the sale of land, a lease of property over three years, a consumer credit agreement, and a bill of exchange. A contract for guarantee must also, at some stage, be evidenced in writing. Finally, English law takes the approach that a <b>gratuitous</b> promise, as a matter of contract law, is not legally binding. While a gift that is delivered will transfer property irrevocably, and while someone may always bind themselves to a promise without anything in return to deliver a thing in future if they sign a deed that is witnessed, a simple promise to do something in future can be revoked. This result is reached, with some complexity, through a peculiarity of English law called the doctrine of consideration.|$|E
500|$|The Independent writer Nicholas Barber stated [...] "Janet's concerts are the pop {{equivalent}} of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, <b>gratuitous</b> cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the seventh}} season, 61% of Rotten Tomatoes' 11 critic reviews rated it positively, {{with an average}} score of 6.97/10. The site's {{consensus}} is, [...] "Increased character depth and effective world-building helps The Walking Dead overcome a tiresome reliance on excessive, <b>gratuitous</b> violence." ...|$|E
500|$|The stories' {{sexual content}} is prominent, {{though not in}} the <b>gratuitous</b> manner of ' celebration of hedonism, which contrasted with the {{conservative}} lifestyle of Eisner the middle-aged businessman. [...] Eisner used no profanity in the book, and according to critic Josh Lambert the sex in Contract {{is not so much}} erotic as disturbing, the characters frustrated or filled with guilt.|$|E
500|$|Despite South Park {{eventually}} {{rising to}} immense popularity and acclaim, initial {{reviews of the}} pilot were generally negative; critics singled out the <b>gratuitous</b> obscenity of the show for particular scorn. Regarding the amount of obscenity in the episode, Parker later commented that they felt [...] "pressure" [...] {{to live up to}} the earlier shorts which first made the duo popular. Critics also compared South Park unfavorably with what they felt were more complex and nuanced animated shows, such as Beavis and Butt-Head and The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The graphic {{depiction}} {{of violence in}} The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was [...] "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", {{as opposed to being}} used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was [...] "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to <b>gratuitous.</b> USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the [...] "incredibly brutal" [...] combat, the violence never felt <b>gratuitous.</b> Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not [...] "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is [...] "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game.|$|E
500|$|Other figures {{associated}} with The Simpsons have publicly criticized the episode. In an April 2001 interview, Harry Shearer, {{the voice of}} Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed {{it in the trash}} can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and <b>gratuitous,</b> and it's disrespectful to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers, {{even those}} usually hostile to Etty, were {{generally}} {{positive about the}} work, and towards Etty's demonstration {{of his ability to}} paint a major piece depicting visual matter that did not depend on nudity or sensuality. Leigh Hunt's London Journal noted that they were [...] "glad to see him turn his abilities into a channel acknowledgedly more profitable than others are apt to be, and we heartily wish him success in it"; the same reviewer did, however, savagely criticise Venus and her Satellites for its <b>gratuitous</b> nudity and a [...] "total absence of soul".|$|E
500|$|The Twilight series {{falls under}} the genre of young adult, fantasy, and romance, though Meyer {{categorized}} her first book, Twilight, as [...] "suspense romance horror comedy". However, she states that she considers her books as [...] "romance more than anything else". The series explores the unorthodox romance between human Bella and vampire Edward, {{as well as the}} love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, a werewolf. The books avoid delving into provocative sex, drugs, and harsh swearing because, according to Meyer, [...] "I don't think teens need to read about <b>gratuitous</b> sex." ...|$|E
