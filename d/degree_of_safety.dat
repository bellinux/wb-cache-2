Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, {{there is still much}} that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E

The defeat {{marked the end of}} the campaign and the end of French hopes of seriously disrupting British trade with India: the only remaining safe harbours in the region were a few Dutch colonies on Java, which became the next target of the Royal Navy forces in the region. The Mauritius campaign also had an effect on British post-war strategy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrated by the retention of Mauritius as a colony.

In the paper, order degree evaluation index system <b>of</b> coalmine <b>safety</b> and economy has been established and by SPSS software coordination <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> coalmine <b>safety</b> and economy level has been calculated quantitatively. Coordination order <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> coalmine <b>safety</b> and economy <b>of</b> Shanxi Province has been calculated. The order <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> coalmine <b>safety</b> subsystem and economy subsystem have been obtained. Their coordination degree has also been obtained. Their coordination degree is not very high. Its main {{reason is that the}} order <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> coalmine <b>safety</b> subsystem is low. In recent years, rapid developing of economy led to poor safety. Namely, the two subsystems couldn’t accord each other.

While reindeer harvesting is usually a pleasant experience and the following problems may never be encountered, it can also be exhausting and does entail some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> risk. Good hygiene and adequate hydration can protect against infections, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis. A small first aid kit should be carried when away from the campsite or boat, and preparations should be made for the various hazards of outdoor recreation. The terrain can be hilly, mountainous, uneven, and stony, with hidden crevices or holes. It may also be marshy, muddy, and wet. It may be necessary to cross streams and rivers, and slippery rocks present a hazard. If there is snow and ice, there can be cornices, crevasses, and avalanches, although snow can make it easier to spot and track reindeer.|$|E

[...] The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1.

[...] The Court contemplated the highest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> would require the banning of scissors and other such objects. [...] Thus, safety in school is usually only supposed to be [...] "reasonable." [...] However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective to be reasonable. [...] This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} provide basic data for improving patient safety in nursing homes in Korea by measuring the patient <b>safety</b> culture <b>of</b> nursing homes and understanding its influencing factors. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a descriptive research study using data from development and validation of the Korean patient safety culture scale for nursing homes. A total of 982 cases were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics 20 program. Results: For the <b>safety</b> culture <b>of</b> the patient, there was a significant difference based on the size and location of the facility. For the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>safety,</b> age, education, occupation, marital status, and the size of the nursing home were significant factors.

60|$|It is Mr. Locke's opinion, that {{darkness}} is not naturally {{an idea of}} terror; and that, {{though an}} excessive light is painful to the sense, the greatest excess of darkness is no ways troublesome.

The authority of this great man is doubtless as great as that of any man can be, {{and it seems to}} {{stand in the way of}} our general principle.[37] We have considered darkness as a cause of the sublime; and we have all along considered the sublime as depending on some modification of pain or terror: so that if darkness be no way painful or terrible to any, who have not had their minds early tainted with superstitions, it can be no source of the sublime to them. But, with all deference to such an authority, it seems to me, that an association of a more general nature, an association which takes in all mankind, may make darkness terrible; for in utter darkness it is impossible to know in what <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> we stand; we are ignorant of the objects that surround us; we may every moment strike against some dangerous obstruction; we may fall down a precipice the first step we take; and if an enemy approach, we know not in what quarter to defend ourselves; in such a case strength is no sure protection; wisdom can only act by guess; the boldest are staggered, and he who would pray for nothing else towards his defence is forced to pray for light.|$|E
