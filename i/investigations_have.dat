5|$|Although it's {{believed}} that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and geotechnical <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location. The CLA Building suffers from structural flaws, most notably, water intrusion. In 2005, the university {{filed a lawsuit against}} a contractor, for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court settlement. Amid these concerns, on September 2010, the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> found {{evidence}} of domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E

5|$|However, further <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that the arsenic content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.|$|E
5|$|It is {{currently}} occupied by an office development, also called Greyfriars, {{and parts of}} Bristol Dental School. Traces of the abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small oval window was incorporated into the new building.

5|$|Themes {{from these}} social <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> been drawn out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural {{encounters}} and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though {{the area has}} been productive of local writing talent, {{from the time of}} Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a fascination for a coterie of the literati.|$|E
5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> shown it to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> found {{evidence}} for prehistoric {{activity in the}} Shepton Mallet area, with substantial amounts of Neolithic flint being found, {{as well as some}} pottery fragments from the late-Neolithic period. The two barrows on Barren Down, {{to the north of the}} town centre contained cremation burials from the bronze age and another bronze age burial site contained a skeleton and some pottery. The remains of iron age roundhouses and artefacts such as quernstones and beads were found at Cannard's Grave and a probable iron age farm settlement enclosure has been identified at Field Farm. In the countryside surrounding the town, there is evidence of iron age cave dwellings in Ham Woods, to the north-west, and a number of burial mounds have been identified at Beacon Hill, a short distance north of the town.|$|E

5|$|Flerovium is {{currently}} the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium. The first experiment involved the reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl and the second the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,4n)288Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied. The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were {{compared with those of}} radon, as it was then expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour. Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.|$|E
5|$|Once other <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> {{indicated}} Wilson's disease, {{the ideal}} test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. <b>Investigations</b> <b>have</b> shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} a crescent of low chalk hills, the Yorkshire Wolds, surrounded by the low-lying fertile plains of Holderness and the Vale of York. The Humber Estuary and North Sea mark its southern and eastern limits. Archaeological <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> revealed artefacts and structures from all historical periods since the last ice age. There are few large settlements and no industrial centres. The area is administered from the ancient market and ecclesiastical town of Beverley. Christianity is the religion with the largest following {{in the area and}} there is a higher than average percentage of retired people in residence.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> {{revealed}} that the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological <b>investigations</b> <b>have</b> {{shown that}} the {{destruction}} of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously {{with the arrival of}} so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|E
