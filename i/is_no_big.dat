At the height of the French Revolution it was noticed that Danton was tall and Murat short.

The doctrine of human equality reposes upon this: That there is no man really clever who has not found that he is stupid. That there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> man who has not felt small. Some men never feel small; but these are the few men who are.|$|E
