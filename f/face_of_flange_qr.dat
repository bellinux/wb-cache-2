50|$|A choke {{connection}} is formed by mating one choke flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central region <b>of</b> the choke <b>flange</b> <b>face</b> is very slightly recessed {{so that it}} does not touch the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the cover <b>flange,</b> but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep choke trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flange.</b> Choke flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the choke ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes choke flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a choke flange.|$|R

40|$|Composite T-joints are {{commonly}} used in modern composite airframe, pressure vessels and piping structures, mainly to increase the bending strength of the joint and prevents buckling of plates and shells, and in multi-cell thin-walled structures. Here we report a detailed study on the propagation of guided ultrasonic wave modes in a composite T-joint and their interactions with delamination in the co-cured co-bonded flange. A well designed guiding path is employed wherein the waves undergo a two step mode conversion process, one {{is due to the}} web and joint filler on the back <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flange</b> and the other is due to the delamination edges close to underneath the accessible surface <b>of</b> the <b>flange.</b> A 3 D Laser Doppler Vibrometer is used to obtain the three components of surface displacements/velocities <b>of</b> the accessible <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> the T-joint.

50|$|A {{waveguide}} flange is {{a connector}} for joining sections of waveguide, and {{is essentially the}} same as a pipe flange—a waveguide, {{in the context of this}} article, being a hollow metal conduit for microwave energy. The connecting <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flange</b> is either square, circular or (particularly for large or reduced-height rectangular waveguides), rectangular. The connection between a pair <b>of</b> <b>flanges</b> is usually made with four or more bolts, though alternative mechanisms, such as a threaded collar, may be used where there is a need for rapid assembly and disassembly. Dowel pins are sometimes used in addition to bolts, to ensure accurate alignment, particularly for very small waveguides.|$|R

50|$|A contact {{connection}} is {{formed by the}} union of any combination of gasket and cover flanges, and ideally creates a continuous inner surface from one waveguide to the other, with no crack at the join to interrupt the surface currents. The difficulty {{with this sort of}} connection is that any manufacturing imperfections or dirt or damage on the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flanges</b> will result in a crack. Arcing of the current across the crack will cause further damage, loss of power, and may give rise to arcing {{from one side of the}} guide to the other, thereby short circuiting it.|$|R

40|$|Radial forging is {{a process}} in which one or two punches move axially causing a radial flow into a die cavity by means <b>of</b> which a <b>flange</b> is formed.

To better {{understand}} the effect of parameters affecting the warping in radial forging a Finite Element analysis was used to simulate the process with isotropic elastic-plastic material model. Parameters such as die corner Radius (r) or shape and ring gap Height (H), on the warping, were investigated and results were compared with experimental work.

50|$|It is {{considered}} wrong to join together two choke flanges; the resulting {{gap between the}} flange faces is twice that intended, and the effect {{is similar to that}} of having two joins in the guide rather than one. In the absence <b>of</b> unpressurizable choke <b>flanges,</b> all flanges fall into one of three categories: choke, gasket/cover and cover. An E-plane cross section of an assembled choke connection is shown in figure 3. This is the plane cutting each of the broad walls of the waveguide along its centre-line, which is where the longitudinal surface currents—those that must cross the join—are at their strongest. The choke ditch and the gap between the flange faces together form a somewhat convoluted side-branch to the path of the main guide. This side branch is designed to present a low input impedance where it meets the broad walls of the waveguide, so that the surface currents there are not obstructed by the gap, but instead flow onto and off <b>of</b> the separated <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flanges.</b> Conversely, on the outer edge of the choke ditch, at the point where the two flanges come into physical contact, the ditch presents a high series impedance. The current through the contact point is thus reduced to a small value, and the danger of arcing across any crack between the flanges is likewise reduced.|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large diameter flanges for the supply of water in South Africa. These large diameter pipe flanges are required to accommodate pipes with nominal bores of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types <b>of</b> integral <b>flange</b> designs are considered, namely: flat face, raised face, and a modified raised face with an O-ring groove. The effects <b>of</b> creep-relaxation, <b>flange</b> rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flange</b> and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large diameter flanges. It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the sealing ability, circular bolted flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.
