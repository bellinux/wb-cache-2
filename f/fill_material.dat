Ninety single-rooted straight premolars were instrumented and randomly divided into 9 groups of 10 teeth each (n = 10) with regards to <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> and instrument used. For all roots, the following data were recorded: procedural errors, time of retreatment, apically extruded material, canal wall cleanliness through optical stereomicroscopy (OSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A linear regression analysis and three logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the level of significance set at p = 0. 05. The results indicated that the overall regression models were statistically significant. The Mtwo R, ProTaper retreatment files, and Resilon <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> had a positive impact in reducing the time for retreatment.

An evaluation of the potential mobility of soil pollution residues where <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> had been used was carried out for five different locations in Sweden.

The results from the study show that the TOC and porosity content in <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> has a significant impact on the mobility of soil pollution residues. <b>Filling</b> <b>materials</b> with less TOC than the remediated soil will contribute to an increased mobility of organic pollution residues to the air, surface water and groundwater, whilst lower soil porosity, or rather lower soil water content will contribute to an increased mobility of airborne pollution residues.

In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone {{in the middle of the}} bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of <b>fill</b> <b>material</b> (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.|$|E

METHODS: 122 human molars with 10 different <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> at defined <b>filling</b> diameters were examined. The teeth were CT scanned both before and after the exposure to different temperatures. After image reconstruction, the teeth and <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> were analyzed regarding their morphology and Hounsfield units (HU) using an extended HU scale. RESULTS: The majority of <b>filling</b> <b>materials</b> diminished in size at temperatures >/= 400 degrees C.

Most of the retreatment methods tested in earlier {{studies have shown}} inability to achieve complete removal of root canal filling. Therefore {{the aim of this}} investigation was to assess the efficacy of three different rotary nickel titanium retreatment systems and Hedstrom files in removing <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> from root canals. Material and Methods: Sixty extracted mandibular premolars were decoronated to leave 15 mm root. Specimen were hand instrumented and obturated using gutta percha and AH plus root canal sealer. After storage period of two weeks, roots were retreated with three (Protaper retreatment files, Mtwo retreatment files, NRT GPR) rotary retreatment instrument systems and Hedstroem files. Subsequently, samples were sectioned longitudinally and examined under stereomicroscope. Digital images were recorded and evaluated using Digital Image Analysing Software. The retreatment time was recorded for each tooth using a stopwatch. The area of canal and the residual <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> was recorded in mm 2 and the percentage of remaining <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> on canal walls was calculated. Data was analysed using ANOVA test. Results: Significantly less amount of residual <b>filling</b> <b>material</b> was present in protaper and Mtwo instrumented teeth (p < 0. 05) compared to NRT GPR and Hedstrom files group.
