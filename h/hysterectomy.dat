5|$|In 1989, the {{character}} {{was used to}} highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when {{the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary <b>hysterectomy.</b> Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision {{that had been made}} by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of <b>hysterectomy</b> including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
25|$|After <b>hysterectomy</b> for benign {{indications}} {{the majority}} of women report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain.

The picture is significantly different for <b>hysterectomy</b> performed for malignant reasons; the procedure is often more radical with substantial side effects. A proportion of patients who undergo a <b>hysterectomy</b> for chronic pelvic pain continue to suffer from pelvic pain after a <b>hysterectomy</b> and develop dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).|$|E

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 28 JUN 2008 Summary: A retrospective audit of <b>hysterectomies</b> in young women (age 30 years and under) was conducted. Forty-one <b>hysterectomies,</b> representing 4 % of all <b>hysterectomies</b> at the hospital, were performed in women {{of this age}} group. The main clinical indications were abnormal uterine bleeding (44 %), pelvic pain (20 %) and endometriosis (15 %). None were performed for invasive malignant conditions. Most women had some prior therapy for their symptoms. Thirty-seven of the operations were total abdominal <b>hysterectomies</b> and 4 women had a unilateral oophorectomy. Complications were found in 17 women. Causal pathology, though not always what was predicted clinically or {{on the basis of}} operative findings, was identified.

25|$|Subtotal (supracervical) <b>hysterectomy</b> was {{originally}} proposed {{with the expectation}} that it may improve sexual functioning after <b>hysterectomy,</b> it has been postulated that removing the cervix causes excessive neurologic and anatomic disruption, thus leading to vaginal shortening, vaginal vault prolapse, and vaginal cuff granulations. These theoretical advantages were not confirmed in practice, but other advantages over total <b>hysterectomy</b> emerged. The principal disadvantage is that risk of cervical cancer is not eliminated and women may continue cyclical bleeding (although substantially less than before the surgery).|$|E
25|$|<b>Hysterectomy</b> can be {{performed}} in different ways. The oldest known technique is abdominal incision. Subsequently the vaginal (performing the <b>hysterectomy</b> through the vaginal canal) and later laparoscopic vaginal (with additional instruments inserted through a small hole, frequently close to the navel) techniques were developed.|$|E
25|$|Oophorectomy is an intraabdominal {{surgery and}} serious {{complications}} stemming {{directly from the}} surgery are rare.
