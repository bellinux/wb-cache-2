5|$|A North <b>Korean</b> {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North <b>Korean</b> tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 North <b>Korean</b> infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North <b>Korean</b> advance. North <b>Korean</b> troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E

5|$|After the Second Manchu {{invasion}} of Korea, Joseon Korea {{was forced to}} give several of their royal princesses as concubines to the Qing Manchu regent Prince Dorgon. In 1650, Dorgon married the <b>Korean</b> Princess Yishun/Uisun (義願). She was a collateral branch of the <b>Korean</b> royal family, and daughter of Yi Gae-yun (李愷胤).

5000|$|Kim Jong-jin et al. (2005) {{did a study}} {{about the}} genetic {{relationships}} among East Asians based on allele frequencies, particularly focusing on how Chinese, Japanese and <b>Koreans</b> are related. Most <b>Koreans</b> were hard to distinguish from Japanese, and the study {{was not able to}} clearly distinguish <b>Koreans</b> and Japanese. <b>Koreans</b> and Japanese clustered together in the principal component analysis and the best least-squares tree. The study said that [...] "common ancestry and/or extensive gene flow" [...] historically between <b>Koreans</b> and Japanese appears to be [...] "likely" [...] and results in a lot of difficulty finding population-specific alleles that could assist in differentiating <b>Koreans</b> and Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|Due to differing {{language}} and immigration history, Sakhalin <b>Koreans</b> {{may or may}} not identify themselves as Koryo-saram. The term [...] "Koryo-saram" [...] may be used to encompass to all <b>Koreans</b> in the former USSR, but typically refers to ethnic <b>Koreans</b> from Hamgyŏng province whose ancestors emigrated to the Russian Far East in the 19th century, and then were later deported to Central Asia. The issue of self-identification is {{complicated by the fact that}} many Sakhalin <b>Koreans</b> feel that <b>Koreans</b> from Central Asia look down on them.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{outbreak}} of the <b>Korean</b> War in 1950, most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South <b>Korean</b> control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood on the front lines, as North <b>Korean</b> forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang.|$|E

5|$|In the east, the North <b>Korean</b> army, 89,000men strong, had {{advanced}} into South Korea in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise and completely routing it. The smaller South <b>Korean</b> army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North <b>Korean</b> forces destroyed isolated {{resistance from the}} 38,000South <b>Korean</b> soldiers on the front before moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of}} the advance. By June 28, the North Koreans had captured South Korea's capital of Seoul, forcing the government and its shattered forces to retreat further south. Though it was steadily pushed back, South <b>Korean</b> forces increased their resistance further south, hoping to delay North <b>Korean</b> units as much as possible. North and South <b>Korean</b> units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The ROK Army defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back, and managed to repel North <b>Korean</b> forces in the Battle of Andong.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the current {{situation}} of language use, ethnic identity, and ethnic relations of <b>Koreans</b> in Central Asia. The primary set of {{data for this study}} came from a sample survey of 1, 302 <b>Koreans</b> in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Moscow, Sankt Perterburg, and Sakhalin done in July 1997 through March 1998. Raymond Breton’s concept of institutional complete-ness proved to be useful in explaining the regional and temporal differences in the level of assimilation of <b>Koreans</b> to Russian culture and society. High levels of education and occupational upward mobility of <b>Koreans</b> in urban areas, historical experiences and structural conditions have contributed to the assimilation of <b>Koreans</b> in Russian society. Nonetheless, <b>Koreans</b> have maintained high levels of ethnic identity primarily because ethnicity is a socially imposed and recognized marker, differentiating <b>Koreans</b> from others and limiting their life chances...|$|R

5|$|In the {{mountains}} northeast of Waegwan, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer North <b>Korean</b> attacks throughout mid-August. North <b>Korean</b> pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long. US planners believed the main North <b>Korean</b> attack {{would come from}} the west, and so it massed its forces {{to the west of}} Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 North <b>Korean</b> troops were near Taegu. This number was above the actual troop numbers for North Korea, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter.|$|E
5|$|North <b>Korean</b> {{casualties}} {{could not}} be estimated {{because of lack of}} communications between units during the battle, which limited the value of American signals intelligence. North <b>Korean</b> armor suffered heavy losses. A total of 15–20 North <b>Korean</b> tanks were destroyed by anti-tank weapons and US aircraft, and North <b>Korean</b> prisoners estimated that 15 76-mm guns, six 122-mm mortars, and 200 artillerymen were lost. Losses among North <b>Korean</b> infantry were heavy, especially in the NK 3rd Division. The NK 3rd division was reported between 60 and 80 percent of its strength {{at the beginning of the}} battle and was reduced to 50 percent by its end, with total casualties ranging from 1,250 to 3,300.|$|E
5|$|North <b>Korean</b> {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North <b>Korean</b> 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North <b>Korean</b> 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North <b>Korean</b> 105th Armored Division. Although the North <b>Korean</b> 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North <b>Korean</b> army launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea.

North <b>Korean</b> forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the opposing 38,000 front-line South <b>Korean</b> men. The majority of the South <b>Korean</b> forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the southern capital, Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw southward.|$|E
