40|$|An {{experimental}} {{machine vision}} system that reads pages of printed text is described, with {{particular attention to}} features which permit it {{to cope with a}} variety of languages. We have attempted to uncouple sources of variation in the input- irnaging defects, page layouts, sizes of text, symbol sets, font styles, linguistic contexts, and transliteration encodings- so that each can be managed by an independent subsystem. In pursuit of this goal, new algorithms have been required. For example. page layout analysis is virtually language-independent due to the use of a global-to-local strategy; but this demanded unusually fast and accurate algorithms for skew- and shear-correction and for analysis of the structure of white space. To permit arbitrary combinations of symbol sets, font styles, and <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> distributions for specialized classifiers, we developed a hybrid structuraVstatistica 1 recognition technology, trained by examples generated by a pseudo-random <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> model. Character segmentation is driven by classifier confidence scores, with the result that language-specific rules are rarely needed. Linguistic context, such as provided by dictionaries, is exploited by a series of data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner. 1...|$|E

To study general drawing analysis systems, we use unconstrained, well-behaved random polygons as test inputs.

Image analysis algorithms are then applied to these samples, and the results are empirically evaluated by matching them against a ground truth. Discrepancies are regarded as image analysis errors and categorized. The relationship between image defects and an algorithm's error behavior can then be analyzed.

40|$|ISBN : 978 - 1 - 4799 - 0039 - 8 International audienceInterconnection {{lines in}} the sensors of CMOS imagers are used for pixel bias, {{addressing}} and readout. Catastrophic faults in these lines can cause parts of the pixel matrix to operate incorrectly and produce <b>image</b> <b>defects</b> like residual stripes and bands in images. These kinds of <b>image</b> <b>defects</b> are often difficult to remove by the image processing correction algorithm, and they are clearly visible {{as a sort of}} noise pattern. Among the defects in the pixel array, these catastrophic faults have most important influence on yield. In addition, partially degraded metal lines cannot be detected on todays' standard industrial testers for <b>image</b> sensors. These <b>defects</b> can evolve into catastrophic faults and they are the main cause of customer returns for many products. This paper proposes two built-in self-test (BIST) solutions to catch these defects in the pixel array, taking into account the industrial test constraints, namely increase of fault coverage, decrease of test time and test cost minimization...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of evaluating character image generators that model distortions encountered in optical character recognition (OCR). While a number of such defect models have been proposed, the contention that they produce the desired result is typically argued in an ad hoc and informal way. We introduce a rigorous and more pragmatic definition of when a model is accurate: we say a defect model is validated if the OCR errors induced by the model are indistinguishable from the errors encountered when using real scanned documents. We describe four measures to quantify this similarity, and compare and contrast them using over ten million scanned and synthesized characters in three fonts. The measures differentiate effectively between different fonts and different scans of the same font regardless of the underlying text.

40|$|Large {{amount of}} chart images with their ground truth are {{essential}} in training and testing chart understanding systems. However, manually retrieving ground truth from real-life chart images is a time consuming and error-prone process. In this project, we propose a procedure that makes ground truthing a fast and reliable task by generating synthesized chart images and automatically obtaining their ground truth. We systematically study the hierarchical structures of chart images, and define 4 levels of ground truth to be recorded. To make synthetic images more helpful in training and testing, we design our own parameterized image degradation model which simulates some commonly seen realworld <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> types. By applying such degradation model, synthesized noise-free images can be further degraded with precise controls. Based on above ideas, we build a software package {{which can be used}} to generate chart image ground truth databases with large sizes in a short time, this will greatly facilitate researchers in training and testing their chart understanding systems.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} proposes a defect {{analysis}} system, which automatically aligns a digitized copy of a printed output to a reference electronic original and highlights <b>image</b> <b>defects.</b> We focus on a class of <b>image</b> <b>defects</b> or artifacts caused by shortfalls in the mechanical or electro-photographic processes that include spots, deletions and debris missing deletions. The algorithm begins with image registration performed using a logpolar transformation and mutual information techniques. A confidence map is then calculated by comparing the contrast and entropy {{in the neighborhood of}} each pixel in both the printed document and corresponding electronic original. This results in a qualitative difference map of the two images highlighting the detected defects. The algorithm was demonstrated successfully on a collection of 99 printed images based on 11 original electronic images and test patterns printed on 9 different faulty printers provided by Xerox Corporation. The proposed algorithm is effective in aligning digitized printed output irrespective of translation, rotation and scale variations, and identifying defects in color inconsistent hardcopies...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an experiment in}} estimating the Bayes error of a concrete image classification problem: a difficult, practically important, two [...] class character recognition problem. The Bayes error gives the "intrinsic difficulty" of the problem {{since it is the}} minimum error achievable by any classification method. Since for many realistically complex problems, deriving this analytically appears to be hopeless, we approach the task empirically. We proceed first by expressing the problem precisely in terms of ideal prototype images and an <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> model, and then by carrying out the estimation on pseudorandomly simulated data. Arriving at sharp estimates seems inevitably to require both large sample sizes [...] - in our trial, over a million images [...] - and careful statistical extrapolation.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an experiment in}} which an OCR classifier is evaluated on synthetic character images created using a document <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> model.

For a particular classifier, we show that good performance [...] - accuracy above a given threshold [...] - occurs within contiguous regions of the space defined by the range of key parameters of the defect model. 1 Introduction We are interested in developing a systematic strategy of evaluating and improving OCR accuracy. OCR accuracies reported in the literature are often measured on essentially arbitrary data sets collected in an ad hoc manner. The type of image defects contained in such data sets cannot be quantitatively specified. Also, due to the high cost of collection and truthing, these data sets are usually too small to provide uniform coverage of defects. The resulting biases limit the projectabil [...] ...|$|E

The temporal changes in sequential quantitative 201 infarct imaging was studied 4 and 24 hours in dogs subjected to closed-chest anterior wall myocardial infarction. A temporal decrease in 201 TI imaged infarct areas was noted in 10 of 13 animals. In no animal did the infarct area increase. The imaged infarct area decreased {{by an average}} of 30 % from 12. 9 ± 6. 2 cm 2 at 4 hours to 9. 1 ± 5. 1 cm 2 at 24 hours (p < 0. 001), and involved 34 ± 16 % of the total 201 TI left ventricular distribution at 4 hours and 22 ± 14 % at 24 hours (p < 0. 001). The magnitude of temporal change in imaged infarct area was not predicted by initial <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> or final histopathologic infarct size.

Photonic crystal fabrication research {{has the potential to}} help us generate and use light more effciently. In order to fabricate active 3 D woodpile photonic structure devices, a woodpile template is needed to enable the crystal growth process. We developed a silica woodpile template fabrication process based on two polymer transfer molding technique. A silica woodpile template is demonstrated to work with temperature up to 900 ÃÂÃÂ°C. It provides a more economical way to explore making better 3 D active woodpile photonic devices like 3 D photonic light emitting diodes (LED).

40|$|SUMMARY Infarct, {{perfusion}} {{and blood}} pool scintigraphy were performed in 62 patients during hospi-talization for acute myocardial infarction. The largest measured infarct or perfusion <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> and left ventricular ejection fraction {{were related to}} the late prognosis determined a mean of 16 months after the event. Breakpoint values for all scintigraphic variables could separate those who were asymptomatic on follow-up from those who died. The best indicators for selection of survivors and nonsurvivors were a scintigraphic infarct size ¢ 25 cm 2 and a perfusion abnormality> 35 % of the projected left ventricular area. Among patients with perfusion abnormalities above this limit, 61 % died; 93 % of those with small perfusion abnormalities survived. Scintigraphic measurements of relative myocardial perfusion and function best separated patients asymptomatic on follow-up from those who developed heart failure and also best identified those with an unfavorable evolution, who developed heart failure or died. Early scintigraphic parameters appeared more accurate than other clinical laboratory indicators for determining late progno-sis and could be important in planning treatment after acute infarction. ACUTE myocardial infarct (AMI) size is an indicator of prognosis after infarction. Postmortem studies hav...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} switching {{phenomenon in}} many transition metal oxides {{is described by}} ion motion leading {{to the formation of}} oxygen-deficient, highly electron-doped filaments. In this paper, the interface and subinterface region of electroformed and switched metal–insulator–metal structures fabricated from a thin Fe-doped SrTiO 3 (STO) film on n-conducting Nb-doped SrTiO 3 crystals are investigated by photoemission electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to gain a deeper understanding of cation movement in this specific system. During electroforming, the segregation of Sr to the top interface and the generation of defect-rich cones in the film are observed, apparently growing from the anode toward the cathode during electroforming. An unusual binding energy component of the Sr 3 d emission line is observed which can be assigned to inline <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> complexes by performing ab initio calculations. Since this Sr component can be reversibly affected by an external electrical bias, the movement of both oxygen and Sr point defects and the formation of defect complexes inline image during resistive switching are suggested. These findings are discussed with regard to the point defect structure of the film and the local oxidation of the donor-doped substrate. In particular, the apparent dichotomy between the observation of acceptor-type defects and increased electronic conductivity in STO is addressed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for defect detection in pipes using a mobile laser-optics technology and conventional digital-geometry-based image processing techniques. The laser-optics {{consists of a}} laser that projects a line onto the pipe’s surface, and an omnidirectional camera. It can be mounted on a pipe crawling robot for conducting continuous inspection. The projected laser line {{will be seen as}} a half-oval in the image. When the laser line passes over defected points, the image moments on the pixel information would change. We propose a B-spline curve fitting on the digitally-convoluted image and a curvature estimation algorithm to detect the defects from the <b>image.</b> <b>Defect</b> sizes of 2 mm or larger can be detected using this method in pipes of up to 24 inch in diameter. The proposed sensor can detect 180 -degree (i. e., upper half surface of the pipe). By turning the sensor 180 degrees, one will be able to detect the other half (i. e., lower half of the pipe’s surface). While, 360 -degree laser rings are available commercially, but they did not provide the intensity needed for our experimentation. We also propose a fast boundary extraction algorithm for real time detection of defects, where a trace of consecutive images are used to track the image features.

40|$|Mirror neurons are {{specialized}} neurons which {{echo the}} movements perceived in another's body in incipient movements in one's own body, {{in a kind}} of involuntary kinesthetic empathy. Their discovery has given rise to a far-reaching reassessment in cognitive science, the arts, and the humanities of the role of empathy and the self-other relation in the constitutionof the sense of self. Mirror-touch synesthesia (when a perceived touch to another's body elicits in the perceiver the sensation of being similarly touched) is one of the forms this "empathy" takes. This article takes mirror-touch synesthesia as a jumping-off point to reconsider synesthesia as a whole, and in particular its relation to empathy, and the relation of empathy to movement. It is argued that the usual vocabulary used to analyze these issues [...] identification, body <b>image,</b> <b>defect</b> or "confusion" in the body's spatial schema [...] are vitiated by a cognitivist bias which carries presuppositions that obscure the complexity of the emergent organization of experience. A philosophical rethinking is necessary as a corrective. The article undertakes this project with the aid of process-oriented philosophers C. S. Peirce, Henri Bergson, and A. N. Whitehead, proposing a framework centering on the notion of a "virtual body" composed of the integral mutual inclusion of potential qualities of experience which are selectively "composed" in movement. The emphasis on the performative self-composition of experience involves replacing the prevailing model of cognition with a fundamentally aesthetic model. Keywo...|$|E
40|$|The {{interfacial}} force microscope (IFM) {{was used}} to indent and <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> free Au(111) surfaces, providing atomic-scale observations of the onset of pileup and the excursion of material above the initial surface plane. Images and load-displacement measurements demonstrate that elastic accommodation of an indenter is followed by two stages of plasticity. The initial stage is identified by slight deviations of the load-displacement relationship from the predicted elastic response. Images acquired after indentations showing only this first stage indicate that these slight load relaxation events result in residual indentations 0. 5 to 4 nm deep with no evidence of pileup or surface orientation dependence. The second stage of plasticity {{is marked by a}} series of dramatic load relaxation events and residual indentations tens of nanometers deep. Images acquired following this second stage document 0. 25 nm pileup terraces which reflect the crystallography of the surface as well as the indenter geometry. Attempts to plastically displace the indenter 4 - 10 nanometers deep into the Au(111) surface were unsuccessful, demonstrating that the transition from stage I to stage H plasticity is associated with overcoming some sort of barrier. Stage I is consistent with previously reported models of dislocation nucleation. The dramatic load relaxations of stage II plasticity, and the pileup of material above the surface, require cross-slip and appear to reflect a dynamic process leading to dislocation intersection with the surface. The IFM measurements reported here offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the very early stages of plasticity and the formation of pileup...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Fifty-two {{patients}} with suspected {{coronary artery disease}} underwent coronary angiography, thallium- 201 myocardial imaging, and ECG-gated blood pool ventriculography at rest and at maximal exer-cise. In 11 {{patients with}}out coronary artery disease, all thallium images were normal. The resting ejection fraction (EF) was normal in all 11 patients and increased during exercise in six, was unchanged in three, and decreased in two. Of the 41 patients with coronary artery disease, the thallium image was normal at rest and at exercise in six (15 %), whereas the exercise EF was abnormal in these six. A new (18 patients) or enlarged (11 patients) defect appeared on the thallium image in 29 of 41 patients (71 %) with coronary disease. Six of 41 patients (15 %) had an abnormal rest thallium image that was unchanged with exercise. An abnormal rest and/or exercise <b>image</b> <b>defect</b> identified 35 of 41 patients (85 %) with coronary artery disease. The resting EF was normal in 26 of the 41 patients (63 %) and in 24 patients demonstrated an abnormal response to exercise. Fifteen patients (37 %) had an abnormal resting EF, and 14 of these 15 demonstrated persistent abnormalities. Thus, an abnormal exercise EF response identified 38 of 41 (93 %) patients with coronary disease. The specificity of the thallium image was 100 % and for the exercise EF determination, 54 % (p < 0. 02).
