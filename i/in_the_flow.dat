5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of the glacier.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the protective effect of <b>the</b> pulsatile <b>flow</b> on <b>the</b> electrically fibrillated myocardium during extracorporeal circulation (ECC), the sequential changes of myocardial energy metabolism from the view point of transmural differences were investigated in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH dogs were produced by a procedure of banding <b>the</b> ascending aorta <b>in</b> 20 puppies 11 to 13 {{months prior to the}} present study. These dogs with LVH were equally divided into a steady flow group and a pulsatile flow group. Under normothermia (at a rectal temperature of 37 â„ƒ), ECC was continued at a constant flow of 80 ml/kg/min for 3 hours. Then, the sequential changes of myocardial energy metabolism in both groups were compared, each differentially subendo-and subepicardial layers.

40|$|Deposition onto {{glass in}} a {{parallel}} plate (PP) and in a stagnation point (SP) flow chamber of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, Psychrobacter sp. and Halomonas pacifica, suspended in artificial seawater, was compared {{in order to determine}} the influence of methodology on bacterial adhesion mechanisms. The three strains had different cell surface hydrophobicities, with water contact angles on bacterial lawns ranging from 18 to 85 degrees. Bacterial zeta potentials in artificial seawater were essentially zero. The three strains showed different adhesion kinetics and the hydrophilic bacterium H. pacifica had the greatest affinity for hydrophilic glass. On average, initial deposition rates were two- to three-fold higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber, possibly due to <b>the</b> convective fluid <b>flow</b> toward <b>the</b> substratum surface <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP <b>flow</b> chamber causing more intimate contact between a substratum and a bacterial cell surface than <b>the</b> gentle collisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber. <b>The</b> ratios between the experimental deposition rates and theoretically calculated deposition rates based on mass transport equations not only differed among the strains, but were also different for <b>the</b> two <b>flow</b> chambers, indicating different mechanisms under the two modes of mass transport. The efficiencies of deposition were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP <b>flow</b> chamber than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber: 62 +/- 4 and 114 +/- 28 % respectively. Experiments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP <b>flow</b> chamber were more reproducible than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber, with standard deviations over triplicate runs of 8 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP and 23 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber. This is probably due to better-controlled convective mass transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SP <b>flow</b> chamber, as compared with the diffusion-controlled mass transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PP <b>flow</b> chamber. <b>In</b> conclusion, this study shows that bacterial adhesion mechanisms depend on the prevailing mass transport conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental set-up used, which makes it essential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design of experiments that a methodology is chosen with mass transport conditions resembling the problem under investigation...|$|R
