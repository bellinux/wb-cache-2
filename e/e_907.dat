Recent cross-linking {{studies have suggested that}} PLB binding and Ca 2 + binding to SERCA 2 a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E 2 conformation of the Ca 2 +-ATPase, preventing formation of E 1, the conformation that binds two Ca 2 + (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca 2 + binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca 2 + pump. Seven SERCA 2 a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca 2 +-binding site I (E 770 Q, T 798 A, and <b>E</b> <b>907</b> Q), site II (E 309 Q and N 795 A), or both sites (D 799 N and E 309 Q/E 770 Q) were made, and the effects of Ca 2 + on N 30 C-PLB cross-linking to Lys 328 of SERCA 2 a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca 2 +-ATPase, none of the SERCA 2 a mutants (except <b>E</b> <b>907</b> Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca 2 +; however, all were phosphorylatable by Pi to form E 2 P. Ca 2 + inhibition of E 2 P formation was observed only in SERCA 2 a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N 30 C-PLB and each Ca 2 +-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca 2 +. Importantly, however, micromolar Ca 2 + inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca 2 +-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca 2 + pumps and N 30 C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca 2 +-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA 2 a...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{methods for}} {{classifying}} gene activity states based on gene expression data have been proposed for use in downstream applications, such as incorporating transcriptomics data into metabolic models {{in order to improve}} resulting flux predictions. These methods often attempt to classify gene activity for each gene in each experimental condition as belonging to one of two states: active (the gene product is part of an active cellular mechanism) or inactive (the cellular mechanism is not active). These existing methods of classifying gene activity states suffer from multiple limitations, including enforcing unrealistic constraints on the overall proportions of active and inactive genes, failing to leverage a priori knowledge of gene co-regulation, failing to account for differences between genes, and failing to provide statistically meaningful confidence estimates. We propose a flexible Bayesian approach to classifying gene activity states based on a Gaussian mixture model. The model integrates genome-wide transcriptomics data from multiple conditions and information about gene co-regulation to provide activity state confidence estimates for each gene in each condition. We compare the performance of our novel method to existing methods on both simulated data and real data from <b>907</b> <b>E.</b> coli gene expression arrays, as well as a comparison with experimentally measured flux values in 29 conditions, demonstrating that our method provides more consistent and accurate results than existing methods across a variety of metrics...|$|R

40|$|Jak 1 is a {{tyrosine}} kinase that noncovalently forms tight complexes {{with a variety}} of cytokine receptors and is critically involved in signal transduction via cytokines. Jaks are predicted to have a 4. 1, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain at their N terminus. FERM domains are composed of three structurally unrelated subdomains (F 1, F 2, and F 3) which are in close contact to one another and form the clover-shaped FERM domain. We generated a model structure of the Jak 1 FERM domain, based on solved FERM structures and the alignments with other FERM domains. To destabilize different subdomains and to uncover their exact function, we mutated specific hydrophobic residues conserved in FERM domains and involved in hydrophobic core interactions. In this study, we show that the structural integrity of the F 2 subdomain of the FERM domain of Jak 1 is necessary to bind the IFN-gammaRalpha. By mutagenesis of hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core between the three FERM subdomains, we find that the structural context of the FERM domain is necessary for the inhibition of Jak 1 phosphorylation. Thus, FERM domain mutations can have repercussions on Jak 1 function. Interestingly, a mutation in the kinase domain (Jak 1 -K <b>907</b> <b>E),</b> known to abolish the catalytic activity, also leads to an impaired binding to the IFN-gammaRalpha when this mutant is expressed at endogenous levels in U 4 C cells.

40|$|Proton {{radiography}} offers significant {{advantages over}} conventional X-ray radiography, including {{the capability of}} looking into thick, dense materials, better contrast {{for a wide range}} of materials, sensitivity to different materials of similar density, and better resolution because of the ability to focus beams. In order to achieve this capability it is crucial to understand the background due to neutrons and photons and to develop techniques to reduce it to tolerable levels. The physics goal of this project is to measure forward production of neutrons and photons produced by high-energy proton beams striking a variety of targets. This work is being carried out in conjunction with the Fermilab Experiment 907 (MIPP) collaboration including physicists from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Our group is responsible for the <b>E</b> <b>907</b> forward neu-tron/photon calorimeters. These are the only detectors in the experiment that provide informa-tion on neutrons and photons.

40|$|Proton {{radiography}} {{has become}} an important tool for predicting the performance of stockpiled nuclear weapons. Current proton radiography experiments at LANSCE are confined to relatively small targets {{on the order of}} centimeters in size because of the low beam energy. LANL scientists have made radiographs with 12 and 24 GeV protons produced by the accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These energies are in the range required for hydrotest radiography. The design of a facility for hydrotest radiography requires knowledge of the cross sections for producing high-energy particles in the forward direction, which are incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation used in designing the beam and detectors. There are few existing measurements of neutron production cross sections for proton-nuclei interactions in the 50 GeV range, and almost no data exist for forward neutron production, especially for heavy target nuclei. Thus the data from the MIPP EMCAL and HCAL, for which our group was responsible, are critical to proton radiography. Since neutrons and photons cannot be focused by magnets, they cause a background “fog” on the images. This problem can be minimized by careful design of the focusing system and detectors. The purpose of our research was to measure forward production of neutrons produced by high-energy proton beams striking a variety of targets. The forward-going particles carry most of the energy from a high-energy proton interaction, so these are the most important to proton radiography.

Over-expression of wild type Apaf- 1 and its E 546 Q and E 546 R variants in HEK 293 T cells does not induce apoptosis unlike - HL- 60 cancer cell line. In vitro apoptosome formation assay showed that all variants are cytochrome c and dATP dependent to form apoptosome and activate endogenous procaspase- 9 in Apaf- 1 -knockout MEF cell line.

Furthermore, the behavior of Apaf- 1 variants for in vitro apoptosome formation in HEK 293 T cell is similar to exogenous wild type Apaf- 1.

Finally, the C 609 W HSCR mutation exerts a dual effect on RET since it leads to a decrease of the receptor at the cell surface and converted RET 51 into a constitutively activated kinase due to the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers.
