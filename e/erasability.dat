40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} Erasure Pure Type Systems, {{an extension}} to Pure Type Systems with an erasure semantics centered around a type constructor ∀ indicating parametric polymorphism. The erasure phase {{is guided by}} lightweight program annotations. The typing rules guarantee that well-typed programs obey a phase distinction between erasable (compile-time) and non-erasable (run-time) terms. The <b>erasability</b> of an expression depends only on how its value {{is used in the}} rest of the program. Despite this simple observation, most languages treat <b>erasability</b> as an intrinsic property of expressions, leading to code duplication problems. Our approach overcomes this deficiency by treating <b>erasability</b> extrinsically. Because the execution model of EPTS generalizes the familiar notions of type erasure and parametric polymorphism, we believe functional programmers will find it quite natural to program in such a setting. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Effects of {{initialization}} {{conditions of}} initialization power {{and number of}} initialization cycles on the recording properties of phase change optical disks were studied. It is found that initialization conditions affect <b>erasability</b> but have little effect on carrier-to-noise ratio of phase change optical disks. The initialization conditions also affect bias power margin. <b>Erasability</b> of more than 20 dB and carrier-to-noise ratio of 54 dB with 4 mW bias power margin were obtained by applying 6 mW of initialization power and 5 initialization cycles.

40|$|Optimal Morse {{matchings}} reveal essential {{structures of}} cell complexes {{that lead to}} powerful tools to study discrete geometrical objects, in particular, discrete 3 -manifolds. However, such matchings {{are known to be}} NP-hard to compute on 3 -manifolds through a reduction to the <b>erasability</b> problem. Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete Morse theory in terms of parameterized complexity. On the one hand, we prove that the <b>erasability</b> problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter. On the other hand, we propose an algorithm for computing optimal Morse matchings on triangulations of 3 -manifolds, which is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth of the bipartite graph representing the adjacency of the 1 - and 2 -simplices. This algorithm also shows fixed-parameter tractability for problems such as <b>erasability</b> and maximum alternating cycle-free matching. We further show that these results are also true when the treewidth of the dual graph of the triangulated 3 -manifold is bounded. Finally, we discuss the topological significance of the chosen parameters and investigate the respective treewidths of simplicial and generalized triangulations of 3 -manifolds...|$|E

The inks are moisture resistant and will not smear. And the uniform quality of the paper assures consistent rulings, excellent writing surface and <b>erasability.</b> If, {{at any time during}} normal use, this product does not perform to your expectations, we will replace it free of charge.

40|$|Nitrogen {{and oxygen}} doped and co-doped GeSbTe (GST) films for phase-change optical {{recording}} are investigated. It is {{found that the}} crystallization temperature increased {{as well as the}} crystalline microstructure refined by doping. The carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) and <b>erasability</b> of phase-change optical disks are improved being up to 52 and 35 dB, respectively, by using an appropriate nitrogen doping or co-doping concentration in the recording layer. Optical disks with co-doped recording layer are found to be superior in the recording characteristics then the single doped recording layer disks...|$|E
40|$|A {{scheme for}} an atomic beam quantum self-eraser is presented. The {{proposal}} {{is based on}} time reversal invariance on a quantum optical Ramsey fringes experiment, where a realization of complementarity for atomic coherence can be achieved. It consists of two high finesse resonators that are pumped and probed by the same atom. This property relates quantum erasing with time reversal symmetry, allowing for a full quantum erasing of the which-way information stored in the cavity fields. The outlined scheme also prepares and observes a non-local state {{in the fields of}} the resonators: a coherent superposition between correlated states of macroscopically separated quantum systems. The proposed scheme emphasizes the role of entanglement swapping in delayed-choice experiments. Finally, we show that the quantum self-eraser violates temporal Bell inequalities and analyze the relation between this violation and the <b>erasability</b> of which-way information.

40|$|Holographic {{recording}} {{has been}} performed {{for the first}} time in ultrathin (20 nm thick) amorphous selenium films. Two different experimental configurations leading to spatial frequencies of 360 and 1000 lines/mm are studied. Whereas a high diffraction efficiency (> 1 %) is achieved in the low-frequency regime, partial <b>erasability</b> is feasible in the high-frequency case. Electron microscopy based techniques show that the whole grating is in the amorphous phase, the dark fringes are denser than the bright ones, and there are no traces of oxidation. Transmittance measurements show a blue shift in the absorption edge of the films upon laser irradiation. The results are discussed in terms of film densification, accomplished through rearrangements in the amorphous selenium chains, the heat flow along the direction of the grating vector playing an important role. © Springer-Verlag 1997.

40|$|A full AFL ℒ is uniformly ℱ-erasable if {{in every}} AFA {{defining}} ℒ (where each automaton signals acceptance by simultaneously entering an accepting state and emptying its storage), the quasi-realtime acceptors also define ℒ. This {{is equivalent to}} the property that every set of languages containing {ε} which generates ℒ under full AFL operations also generates ℒ under AFL operations. A full semi-AFL is uniformly ℱ-erasable if it satisfies the same condition with “semi-AFL” in place of “AFL” and with automata signalling acceptance by simply entering an accepting state. A full AFL is uniformly erasable if it is both uniformly ℱ- and uniformly ℒ-erasable. A study is made of the above three concepts of uniform <b>erasability.</b> The family of all context-free languages and several of its subfamilies are shown to be uniformly erasable. The context-free languages being a uniformly erasable full AFL generalizes the well-known result that every context-free language can be recognized by a quasirealtime pushdown acceptor...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) {{thin-film}} transistor (TFT) memory is very promising for transparent and flexible system-on-panel displays; however, electrical <b>erasability</b> {{has always been}} a severe challenge for this memory. In this article, we demonstrated successfully an electrically programmable-erasable memory with atomic-layer-deposited Al 2 O 3 /Pt nanocrystals/Al 2 O 3 gate stack under a maximal processing temperature of 300 oC. As the programming voltage was enhanced from 14 to 19 V for a constant pulse of 0. 2 ms, the threshold voltage shift increased significantly from 0. 89 to 4. 67 V. When the programmed device was subjected to an appropriate pulse under negative gate bias, it could return to the original state with a superior erasing efficiency. The above phenomena could be attributed to Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling of electrons from the IGZO channel to the Pt nanocrystals during programming, and inverse tunnelling of the trapped electrons during erasing. In terms of 0. 2 -ms programming at 16 V and 350 -ms erasing at − 17 V, a large memory window of 3. 03 V was achieved successfully. Furthermore, the memory exhibited stable repeated programming/erasing (P/E) characteristics and good data retention, i. e., for 2 -ms programming at 14 V and 250 -ms erasing at − 14 V, a memory window of 2. 08 V was still maintained after 103 P/E cycles, and a memory window of 1. 1 V was retained after 105 s retention time...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two parts}} to the thesis: a {{simulation}} {{system and a}} model of the anuran retina. The simulation system, called MDL for Model Development Language, uses an assignment statement notation tailored for 2 -dimensional layered neural networks. The key features are: (1) Operations occur on 2 -dimensional arrays which correspond to the layout of many brain structures. (2) A spatial convolution operation models spatial summation occurring in dendritic trees. (3) Time invariant expressions and differential equations are specified in a manner that removes the numerical methods from the model. These features allow high level modeling using leaky integrator model neurons and modeling of detailed biophysical properties, such as the Hodgkin Huxley equations and voltage clamp experiments. Conciseness of the language allows specification of a moderately complex retina model in only one or two pages. ^ The retina model consists of models for each of the five major anuran ganglion cell types. A common model OPL (Outer Plexiform Layer) containing receptors, horizontals, and bipolar cells generates input to the model Inner Plexiform layer (IPL). Processing in the IPL specific to each ganglion cell type forms the model which qualitatively accounts for many characteristic ganglion cell response properties. The class 2, 3, and 4 cell models also quantitatively account for response dependence on extent and orientation of moving rectangular stimuli and dependence on stimulus velocity. ^ The model shows that horizontal cells are not crucial for most receptive field properties, but may control sensitivity of bipolar cells in a way that prevents class 1 and class 2 cells from responding to full field illumination changes. For class 1, 3, and 4 cells, a simple weighted summation of bipolar cell and differentiated bipolar cell outputs is sufficient to explain responses, although in the class 3 cell, the onset of inhibition must be delayed with respect to excitation. The class 2 cell model requires a more complex means of summing IPL inputs to account for <b>erasability</b> and neuronal adaptation. Differences in transient amacrine cells feeding to each ganglion cell type may underlie variation in velocity dependence. The model yields suggestions for future experiments and modeling. ...|$|E
