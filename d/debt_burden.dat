40|$|The {{dramatic}} rise {{in credit}} card charge-offs {{in the midst}} of a vigorous expansion suggests that bank card borrowers have become inherently riskier. This paper investigates how the mix of credit card borrowers has changed in recent years, and how those changes affect delinquency risk. The new card holders seem riskier along several dimensions. They tend to earn less, and as a result, they owe more relative to income. This rise in <b>debt</b> <b>burdens</b> almost certainly contributed to the rise in charge-offs, since <b>debt</b> <b>burdens</b> are a key determinant of delinquency risk. Card holders are also more likely to work at relatively unskilled blue collar jobs. This occupation shift may also have contributed to the rise in charge-offs, since delinquency rates are higher in these occupations, perhaps because income is more cyclical. Some of the personal characteristics and attitudes that have changed, such as marital status and job tenure, also imply somewhat higher risk. Credit cards; Risk...|$|R

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (there was hardly any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 percent of the Gross National Product at the time). This <b>debt</b> <b>burden</b> rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal <b>debt</b> <b>burden</b> militated against other provinces agreeing to fiscal reform. Fiscal reform was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their interest income, but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in the problem of financial instability in the macro economy. Some researchers have looked for cyclical and secular co-movements between debt accumulation, financial crises, and problems in the real economy. Others have tried to rationalize, in formal models the apparent connections between finance, changes in expectations, and macro instability. Two {{different points of view}} are embodied in this work. One, deriving from the work of Minsky, emphasizes the importance of ignorance and psychology. Firms are seen as financing accumulation on the basis of unverifiable expectations, accumulating <b>debt</b> <b>burdens</b> in the process. When the <b>debt</b> <b>burdens</b> are large enough, the economy becomes vulnerable to downward revisions of expectations. Such revisions reduce effective demand and stimulate financial crises. A second view emphasizes a structural determinant, of instability [...] declining profitability. Problems with profits are viewed as a major cause of <b>debt</b> <b>burdens,</b> and the source of potential financial crisis. What follows is an attempt to synthesize these two viewpoints in a manageable analytical framework. To set the stage, we begin with a brief review of Minsky's ideas, which have to this point received the greater attention. This is followed by a discussion of the structuralist view and some of the key supporting empirical evidence. Next a Keynes-Kalecki model of growth with debt is constructed. It suggests that in economies where debt finances accumulation, stable and unstable configurations of economic variables coexist simultaneously. The proximity of these regions is shown to depend on expectational and distributional factors. The model therefore introduces a way to characterize financial fragility in terms of stability theory, and shows how structuralist and Minskian ideas complement each other. ...|$|R
