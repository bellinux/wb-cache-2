5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or {{a pair of scissors}} {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

5|$|When Lincoln {{finds that}} the camera has not {{detected}} any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater {{makes up}} about {{twenty percent of}} the world's fresh water supply, which is about 0.61% of the entire world's water, {{including}} oceans and permanent ice.

25|$|The attack was, however, no more {{successful}} than the concurrent Red Army offensive. Lieutenant Marsh reported at 2:00 AM that his company was lost, his horses were belly-deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> {{that he could not}} proceed, thus neutralizing a main element in the attack until it returned to the main road, far from its objective, at 5:10 AM. The Poles had suffered heavy casualties by this time, forcing them to withdraw temporarily. Company A was partially surrounded at 6:10 AM and forced to yield ground. Lieutenant Goodloss assumed command when Captain Bailey was killed and subsequently ordered a retreat. Lieutenant , leading a platoon from Company H, 339th Infantry, rushed up from the reserves to cover the British retreat. Lt. Phillips was also mortally wounded in this subsequent delaying action, repelling enemy counterattacks for an hour with a few men and 2 Lewis guns until reinforcements arrived.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December, Bondarchuk and the {{production}} team, with 150 wagons of equipment, traveled to Mukachevo in the Zakarpattia Oblast. The director had only planned to photograph two episodes there: the Battle of Schöngrabern and the Battle of Austerlitz. But due to the harsh winter, none of those could be shot. Bondarchuk revised his plans and decided to film in Zakarpattia 231 scenes {{that were supposed to}} be made elsewhere, while waiting for the weather to improve. The Battle of Krasnoi episode and its related parts were filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> involved 2,500 Soviet soldiers, allocated as extras, who wore French uniform and 500 in Russian ones. When conditions enabled it, 3,000 soldiers from the Carpathian Military District re-created the Battle of Schöngrabern near the village of Kushtanovytsia. The Battle of Austerlitz was filmed in the vicinity of Svaliava. As the budget was exceeded due to the weather and film stock problems, Bondarchuk had to refrain from filming several battle sequences. On 17 May, the crew returned to the capital.|$|E
25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and,</b> observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> went back to the house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Richard Charles LaPoint, an Army {{veteran and}} [...] "New England beach bum", boarded Hughes Airwest Flight 800 at McCarran airport in Las Vegas on January 20. Brandishing what he claimed {{was a bomb}} while the DC-9 was on the taxiway, he demanded $50,000, two parachutes, and a helmet. After {{releasing}} the passengers and two flight attendants, he ordered the plane on an eastward trajectory toward Denver, then bailed out over the treeless plains of northeastern Colorado. Authorities, tracking the locator-equipped parachute and his footprints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> mud, apprehended him a few hours later.|$|E
500|$|When {{there is}} summer melting, the melted snow refreezes lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> firn, and the {{resulting}} layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a visual examination of a core. [...] Identification of these layers, both visually and by measuring density of the core against depth, allows the calculation of a melt-feature percentage (MF): an MF of 100% would mean that every year's deposit of snow showed evidence of melting. [...] MF calculations are averaged over multiple sites or long time periods in order to smooth the data. [...] Plots of MF data over time reveal variations in the climate, and have shown that since the late 20th century melting rates have been increasing.|$|E

500|$|The Cold War trappings {{made the}} match a media sensation. It was called [...] "The Match of the Century", and {{received}} front-page media {{coverage in the}} United States and around the world. Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the previous quarter-century; players closely identified with, and subsidized by, the Soviet state. Kasparov remarked, [...] "Fischer fits ideologically into {{the context of the}} Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it". Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory [...] "the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire". Fischer's sister observed, [...] "Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> gone on to win the world championship".|$|E
500|$|The game is {{a mixture}} of a first-person shooter and a stealth game. [...] Most, but not all, {{missions}} can be solved in multiple ways: using sneaking to avoid danger or by going in with guns blazing. A stealthy approach can be taken to evade security cameras, guard dogs and other obstacles. Enemies are aware of noise made by the player, including footsteps and weapon fire, and they also react to footprints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> dead bodies left lying around. The game features a wide variety of firearms, including a semi-automatic pistol, a revolver, a submachine gun, a sniper rifle, and an assault rifle. Some of the weapons can be loaded with different types of ammunition, including standard full metal jacket bullets, dum dum rounds that expand on impact and cause bleeding damage, and phosphorus-coated tracer bullets that continue to burn upon impact. Silencers and scopes can also be fitted on some weapons.|$|E
500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I wonder if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition."
