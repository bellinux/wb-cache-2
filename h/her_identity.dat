5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses <b>her</b> <b>identity.</b> Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E

30|$|Analyses of the {{interview}} data and classroom video/audio data informed each other and provided emerging insights. The analysis process was not linear but iterative in that I {{went back and forth}} between the two data sources and analyses of the two. I treated Melody’s identities narrated in {{the interview}}s and performed in her AP biology class as a repertoire of <b>her</b> <b>identities</b> that were performed in different social interactional contexts. To capture the rich scope of <b>her</b> <b>identities,</b> I documented in analytic notes my emerging sense of who Melody was by identifying and recording intertextual connections between the findings {{of the interview}}s and classroom recordings, which were sometimes consistent with and in other times inconsistent with or contradictory to each other. The analysis of the large scope of an ethnographic study provided a situated understanding of how Melody spoke, acted, interacted, and learned in the AP biology class.|$|R
5|$|Postman's Park came to {{increased}} public notice in 2004 {{with the release}} of the BAFTA- and Golden Globe-winning film Closer, which stars Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen, and is based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber. A key plot element in the film revolves around Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Alice Ayres (played by Portman in the film) has in fact fabricated <b>her</b> <b>identity</b> based on Ayres's tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, which she had read {{at the time of her}} first meeting with Dan Woolf (Jude Law) at the start of the film.|$|E

An attack on Saya's school results in everyone but Saya and Itsuki dying before Saya can kill the attacking Elder Bairn.

They take pity on her and transform her into a myrrh tree. While in plant form, Myrrha gives birth to Adonis. According to legend, the aromatic exudings of the myrrh tree are Myrrha's tears.|$|E
5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on <b>her</b> <b>identity.</b> On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to her participation in group practices with Korean speaking students, a close analysis of the classroom video recordings suggested Melody also recognized opportunities for participating in class and connecting with a broader group of peers and her teacher.

30|$|This {{analysis}} demonstrates her sense-making of {{the contexts}} in which she engaged. Melody, categorized as a FOB by others, felt isolated and marginalized {{in the school and}} also in the classroom. While she wanted to connect with other students, she could not do so, partly because of her limited English proficiency and partly because of <b>her</b> FOB <b>identity</b> and the marginalization of the FOB-identified students. The finding also suggests that her sense-making was similar to how her mother viewed the family’s contexts as marginalized foreigners. However, she tried to re-author <b>her</b> <b>identities</b> by referring to her friends as “friends” and avoiding the FOB label and asserting that she wanted to befriend a broader group of students. Perhaps she wanted to delete <b>her</b> FOB <b>identity</b> and fit into the Twinkies group. Or, she might have been trying to create a new identity model, such as newcomers that do not have the bad traits that many people ascribed to FOBs.|$|R
