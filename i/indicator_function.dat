The system {{is based on}} actor <b>indicator</b> <b>functions.</b> That is, functions which define if an actor speaks {{at a certain time}} instant. In particular, the cross-correlation and the magnitude of the corresponding the cross-power spectral density of a pair of <b>indicator</b> <b>functions</b> are input to various classifiers, such as voted perceptrons, radial basis function networks, random trees, and support vector machines for dialogue/non-dialogue detection. To boost classifier efficiency AdaBoost is also exploited. The aforementioned classifiers are trained using ground truth <b>indicator</b> <b>functions</b> determined by human annotators for 41 dialogue and another 20 non-dialogue audio instances. For testing, actual <b>indicator</b> <b>functions</b> are derived by applying audio activity detection and actor clustering to audio recordings. 23 instances are randomly chosen among the aforementioned 41 dialogue instances, 17 of which correspond to dialogue scenes and 6 to non-dialogue ones. Accuracy ranging between 0. 739 and 0. 826 is reported.

In constructing and studying properties of factorial designs, traditional design theory treats all factors as nominal.

In this paper <b>indicator</b> <b>functions</b> are introduced to represent factorial designs. A polynomial form of <b>indicator</b> <b>functions</b> is used to characterize the geometric structure of those designs.
