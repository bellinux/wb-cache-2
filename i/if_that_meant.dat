5|$|Upon Harun's death, al-Amin {{ascended the}} throne in Baghdad, where his {{popularity}} was great, while al-Ma'mun remained at Marv, {{from where he}} planned to campaign against the remaining rebels. However, al-Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east, leaving al-Ma'mun with {{little in the way}} of military forces. It was in this time that al-Ma'mun came to rely upon his wazir, the former Barmakid protégé al-Fadl ibn Sahl, who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites, whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed. The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan: the abnaʾ, led by Ali ibn Isa, whom Harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of the Caliph's bodyguard, were joined by other influential officials, chief amongst them al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the Indy 500 and the World 600 (now {{known as the}} Coca-Cola 600) at Charlotte Motor Speedway were held on {{different}} days of the week. A handful of NASCAR regulars participated in both events in the same year, including Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Cale Yarborough, and Lee Roy Yarbrough. From 1974 to 1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely Neil Bonnett in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> skipping Charlotte altogether.|$|E

25|$|The Germans did not {{recognize}} the new government, but also did not take any actions to dissolve it by force (unlike the government of Stepan Bandera in Ukraine). At first German military administration tolerated activities of the government as it {{did not attempt to}} take control of civilian institutions. The Reichskommissariat Ostland, German Civil Administration (Zivilverwaltung) was established on July 17. Instead of using brute force, the Civil Administration slowly removed the government's powers (for example, did not allow to print its decrees in newspapers or broadcast radio announcements) and supplanted its institutions, forcing the Provisional Government to either self-disband or to become a puppet institution. Willing to cooperate <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> recognition and some semblance to autonomy, the government did not agree to become an instrument of German occupation. The government self-disbanded on August 5.|$|E
25|$|The Cherokee freedmen, {{descendants}} of African American slaves owned by {{citizens of the}} Cherokee Nation during the Antebellum Period, were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was {{in the wake of}} the American Civil War, when the US emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States. In reaching peace with the Cherokee, who had sided with the Confederates, the US government required that they end slavery and grant full citizenship to freedmen living within their nation. Those who left could become United States citizens. In a recognition of Cherokee sovereignty, in 1988 the federal court in the Freedmen case of Nero v. Cherokee Nation held that the Cherokee Nation could legally determine its own citizenship requirements, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> excluding {{descendants of}} freedmen who had formerly been considered citizens.|$|E
25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay home and take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{historians are}} unsure <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was <b>meant</b> {{to be an}} ironic {{punishment}} for the soldiers' mutiny or due to Caligula's derangement.

25|$|Ribera {{systematically}} stripped Enríquez of his belongins, also {{launching a}} campaign to discredit him among Spanish merchants. The governor {{took control of the}} shipyard and used it to construct a sloop, a brigantine and a schooner. The animosity between both was fueled by the fact that no side was willing to recognize the authority granted to the other. On one occasion the governor asked him to certify (on behalf of the Royal Guinea Company) that a ship had not returned, after it arrived from St. Thomas loaded with an illegal haul, but Enríquez refused to commit fraud. Due to the pressure involved, he was ultimately forced to do so. However, Enríquez visited the Secretary of Government, who served as witness of the act. The same occurred later with a ship that arrived from Trinidad, but this time he firmly refused, claiming {{that he was willing to}} risk his life <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> conserving his honor.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} {{promoters}} wanted {{the most direct}} route to London, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> building a line all the way there, by-passing important towns in Cornwall and Devon. Before the interested parties could raise the money and get parliamentary authority for their line, the Government actually removed {{the bulk of the}} packet trade to Southampton, so that most of the income for any new line was removed. Some interests continued to press for the best line to London, hoping that the packet trade would return; if necessary they would link with another new railway, but the huge cost of this proved impossible to raise. A more practical scheme running to Plymouth gradually took priority, and at first the trains were to cross the Hamoaze, the body of water {{at the mouth of the}} River Tamar on a steam ferry. This was shown to be unrealistic, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was called in to resolve the difficulty. He designed the bridge over the River Tamar at Saltash, the Royal Albert Bridge: when it was built it was the most prodigious engineering feat in the world. He also improved the details of the route elsewhere. By reaching Plymouth, the company could connect with the South Devon Railway and on to London over the Bristol and Exeter railway and the Great Western Railway. The line was built on the broad gauge.|$|E
500|$|Banks {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He was the Cubs' first black player; {{he became one of}} several former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he [...] "just was not the crusading type. He was so {{grateful}} to be playing baseball for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it." ...|$|E

The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans to know you will have a home game." ...|$|E
500|$|In September, Finn Green, a {{recovering}} alcoholic {{with his own}} story of triumph over adversity, began working for Reeves. A knowledgeable horseman, Green insisted that {{as a condition of}} employment he had the right to advocate for what was best for a horse under his management, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> expressing disagreement and imposing [...] "tough love" [...] on the owners. [...] He and Ritvo saw eye to eye on Mucho Macho Man, and they began planning the colt's return to the track. [...] After a break of almost five months, Mucho Macho Man raced in November and won an allowance race at Aqueduct, beginning a three-race winning streak. He had lost his [...] "babyish" [...] look, put on weight, and as Ritvo put it, [...] "His shoulders [...] up with his behind." [...] Ritvo and Green then mapped out a 2012 workout and racing schedule for Mucho Macho Man, intending to run him every six to ten weeks with recovery time after each race.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mixed}} on the co-op mode. While reviewers praised Bunnyguru's martial arts-inspired moveset, {{they did not}} like Bunnyguru's {{inability}} to grapple, which limits the second player's utility in some situations. Edge Magazine also complained that even when there were two players playing, the camera would always center on Scarygirl, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> that Bunnyguru wound up off screen. Reviews were also mixed for the exploration and collection aspects of the game. Parkin of Eurogamer described these aspects by stating that: [...] "Branching paths through levels add the illusion of depth but, for players who wish to collect 100 per cent of the gems in a stage, trekking backwards and forwards through a level is an inelegant slog". Peter Eykemans of IGN found that the game's branching paths created difficulty for players seeking to gain a rating of [...] "perfection", but goes on to recommend the game to people that enjoy searching for collectables.|$|E

500|$|Berger's SS-HA had a {{problematic}} {{relationship with the}} SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. The SS-FHA wanted the Waffen-SS {{to be a small}} elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid scant attention to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and even mail. Berger's well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the Reichsführer-SS soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the Waffen-SS. Berger's criticisms of Jüttner must be seen {{in the light of the}} advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner's position with Himmler was weakened.|$|E
500|$|Hechicero was one {{of sixteen}} wrestlers {{given a chance to}} compete in the 2014 En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament. The En Busca de un Ídolo tournament {{featured}} younger wrestlers, mostly low-to-mid-card wrestlers where they were given an opportunity to showcase their wrestling skills on a national scale. As part of the tournament each wrestler would earn points from the outcome of their matches, feedback from a panel of judges and a weekly online poll. Hechicero was one eight wrestlers to qualify as he survived a Torneo cibernetico elimination match along with Cavernario, Chachorro, Dragon Lee Guerrero Negro, Jr., Soberano, Jr., Star Jr., and Super Halcón, Jr. Hechicero ended up on the team being coached by Virus each week, with coaching focusing not just on the actual wrestling but also how to play their characters in the ring, interact with the fans and so on. During the weekly judging Hechicero received praise for his in-ring skills but also got several comments on {{the fact that he did}} not wrestle a very rudo style and needed to be more aggressive in the ring, something he tried to incorporate from week to week. After the first round Hechicero won almost every single weekly online poll, propelling him to the top of the ranking at the end with a total of 565 points, 114 more than the second place Cavernario. In the week between the first and the second round Hechicero teamed up with Virus and Cachorro to defeat Negro Casas, Cavernario and Dragon Lee on the May 23 Super Viernes show. In the second round Hechicero lost to Cavernario but defeated both Dragon Lee and Cachorro to earn a total of 250 points, including the majority of the online poll votes. The point score qualified Hechicero for the finals against Cavernario. In the final Cavernario defeated Hechicero two falls to one to win the tournament. The following week all eight [...] "Busca" [...] competitors two trainers faced off in a torneo cibernetico elimination match that saw Negro Casas eliminate Virus as the last man to win the match, Hechicero was eliminated as the sixth man by as he and Cavernario pinned each other at the same time. In the weeks following the En Busca de un Ídolo finals Hechicero began teaming with Mephisto and Ephesto for a couple of shows, possibly signaling that CMLL had plans to make them a trio after Mephisto and Ephesto's regular partner Averno had left CMLL. Later when Mephisto and Ephesto were announced as teaming with El Hombre Sin Nombre ("The Man with No Name") there was initial confusion <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> Hechicero was being given a new ring identify, but once El Hombre Sin Nombre made his debut, it was obvious that the physical appearance and wrestling style did not match Hechicero. On the October 10, 2014 Super Viernes show Hechicero debuted a new look, including a new mask design and trunks in black with gold or red embellishment. As part of his image makeover Hechicero began carrying a bowl that burned with red flames as part of his entrance rituals. At ringside Hechicero often touches and sometimes scoops out the flames from the bowl without hurting his hands.|$|E

2500|$|A Chabad {{house is}} a form of Jewish {{community}} center, primarily serving both educational and observance purposes. Often, until the community can support its own center, the Chabad house is located in the shaliach's home, with the living room being used as the [...] "synagogue". Effort is made to provide an atmosphere in which the nonobservant will not feel intimidated by any perceived contrast between their lack of knowledge of Jewish practice and the advanced knowledge of some of the people they meet there. The term [...] "Chabad House" [...] originated with the creation of the first such outreach center on the campus of UCLA by Rabbi Shlomo Cunin. A key to the Chabad house was given to the Rebbe and he asked <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> that the new house was his home.

Chandler ordered their removal, but the new commissioner said that these men were valuable to the Bureau, so Chandler held off firing the clerks. President Grant was following Chandler's activities and asked why the corrupt clerks at the Bureau had not been fired. Chandler replied to Grant that the Commissioner said {{it would be impossible to}} run the Bureau without them. Grant, then ordered Chandler to fire the corrupt clerks even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> shutting down the Bureau.
