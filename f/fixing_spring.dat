50|$|Several {{variants}} were considered: Wolfgang Hütter detailed a simplified, <b>fixed</b> <b>sprung</b> monowheel version, {{reducing the}} weight so a shorter span, lower wing area design could still meet the RLM's required glide angles. Karl Schewyer and Ferdinand Schmetz both designed tandem seated competition variants, respectively {{with a high}} wing and demountable undercarriage and a low wing, retractable undercarriage. There is no evidence any of these were completed.|$|R
50|$|The slender {{fuselage}} is assembled {{from two}} formed, foam-bonded ply shells, each with inbuilt longerons. Nose and tail cones are of laminated plastic. The pilot {{sits in a}} semi-reclining position, under a long, starboard hinged, canopy which ends at the wing leading edge. The prototypes had longer noses than later aircraft. The Edelweiss lands on a <b>fixed,</b> <b>sprung,</b> monowheel undercarriage, fitted with a wheel brake operated jointly with the airbrakes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two novel {{experiments}} are reported which improve upon pre-vious {{experimental studies of}} Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in that very well controlled initial interfaces are obtained. The first is an incompressible experiment in which an impulsive acceleration is given {{to a system of}} two liquids by bouncing it off of a <b>fixed</b> <b>spring.</b> The second is a shock tube ex-periment in which a well controlled flat interface is obtained by flowing light and heavy gases from opposite ends of a vertical shock tube. Both of these experiments provide particularly well visualized images of the instability far into the nonlinear regime. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of carbon composite materials. The main fuselage and each wing spar {{is a single}} piece. It has a <b>fixed</b> (<b>sprung</b> steel) tricycle undercarriage with spatted wheels, a short nose bearing the 180 hp engine and a 3-bladed variable-pitch propeller. The aircraft was re-certified in 2013 with a new MT Propeller following issues with the previous design. The inverted oil system was also redesigned to improve lubrication during aerobatics. The cockpit features a broad canopy arch and spine. Forward visibility is good. The side-by-side seats are fixed and pilot seating is adjusted with cushions {{as well as a}} rudder bar adjuster. The wings are tapered with square tips and the empennage consists of a large fin and rudder with an oblong tailplane with square tips mid-set to the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: Apesar do amplo uso do Pilates na Fisioterapia, há poucos estudos que avaliaram a ativação elétrica dos músculos nos exercícios. OBJETIVO: Verificar a influência de diferentes regulagens de mola e posições do indivíduo sobre a ativação elétrica dos multífidos (MU) e oblíquos externos (OE) durante a flexoextensão do quadril (FEQ) no Cadillac. MÉTODOS: Oito mulheres praticantes de Pilates por seis meses realizaram 10 repetições de FEQ nas situações: mola baixa (MB), mola fixada a 30 cm do nível em que estava o indivíduo; mola alta (MA), mola fixada a 90 cm do nível em que estava o indivíduo; posição próxima (PP), distância de 10 cm da fixação da mola; posição distante (PD), distância de 30 cm da fixação da mola. Dados cinemáticos e de eletromiografia (EMG) foram coletados sincronizadamente, e os músculos monitorados bilateralmente foram os OE e os MU. Cada movimento de FEQ foi recortado em duas fases (extensão e flexão). O sinal de EMG foi calculado e normalizado usando a contração voluntária máxima (CVM). O Wilcoxon test foi usado para {{investigar}} diferenças entre as situações (p BACKGROUND: Despite of the widepread use of Pilates in Physical Therapy, {{there are}} few studies that have assessed the muscle electrical activation during Pilates exercises. OBJECTIVE: Verify the influence of different spring adjustments and individual positions on the electrical activation of multifidus (MU) and oblique external (OE) muscles during hip flexion-extension (HFE) exercise on the Cadillac. METHODS: Eight women practicing Pilates exercises {{for at least six}} months performed 10 repetitions of HFE in the following situations: Lower <b>Spring,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>fixed</b> at 30 cm in relation to level which the individuals were positioned. Higher <b>Spring,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>fixed</b> at 90 cm in relation to level which the individuals were positioned. Near Position, distance of 10 cm from the <b>fixed</b> <b>spring.</b> Distant Position, distance of 30 cm from the <b>fixed</b> <b>spring.</b> Kinematic and eletromyographic data (EMG) were collected simultaneously and the MU and OE muscles were monitored. Each movement of HFE was splitted in two phases (extension and flexion). The EMG signal was calculated and normalized using the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The Wilcoxon test was used to investigate differences between the situations (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: MU muscle presented muscle activation values ranging from 10 to 20 % MVC, and the highest muscle activation in the lower spring and in the near position. OE muscles presented muscle activation values ranging from 20 to 45 % MVC, and the highest values in the higher spring and in the distant position. CONCLUSION: MU and OE muscles presented a distinct electrical activation during different available spring adjustments and individual positions...|$|R

40|$|The {{high energy}} {{consumption}} of market-ready active suspension systems is the limiting {{factor in the}} competition with semi-active devices. The variable geometry active suspension is an alternative with a significantly lower power consumption. However, previous designs suffer from packaging problems, nonlinear stiffness characteristics, and failsafe issues. This paper discusses the feasibility of a recently presented, new design, variable geometry actuator, which has a <b>fixed</b> <b>spring</b> and constant stiffness. An actuator model is derived that includes the electric motor and friction characteristics. Using this model, a cascaded controller is developed and the steady-state and dynamic properties are evaluated. The simulation results are validated with prototype tests. The results show a good correspondence between simulations and measurements. Furthermore, a 10 Hz bandwidth can be easily obtained. It is concluded that the electromechanical low-power active suspension design is feasible and that the model gives a fairly accurate representation of both the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the prototype. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
50|$|Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is {{the name}} used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans and Methodists {{throughout}} the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the eighth Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, {{the beginning of the}} summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1971 when, with effect from 1972, the movable holiday was replaced with the <b>fixed</b> <b>Spring</b> Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration.|$|R

40|$|Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) {{instability}} {{occurs when}} a planar interface separating two fluids of different density is impulsively accelerated {{in the direction of}} its normal. It {{is one of the most}} fundamental fluid instabilities and is of importance to the fields of astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. Because RM instability experiments are normally carried out in shock tubes, where the generation of a sharp, well-controlled interface between gases is difficult, there is a scarcity of good experimental results. The experiments presented here use a novel technique that circumvents many of the experimental difficulties that have previously limited the study of RM instability in shock tubes. In these experiments, the instability is generated incompressibly, by bouncing a rectangular tank containing two liquids off of a <b>fixed</b> <b>spring.</b> These experiments, which utilize PLIF flow visualization, yield time-motion image sequences of the nonlinear development and transition to turbulence of the instability that are of a quality unattainable in shock tube experiments. Measurements obtained from these images, therefore, provide benchmark data for the evaluation of nonlinear models for the late-time growth of the instability. Because the run time in these experiments is limited, new experiments in the NASA Glenn 2. 2 second drop tower, capable of achieving longer run times, are currently under way...|$|R
