40|$|We {{show how}} to draw evenly dotted and <b>dashed</b> <b>curved</b> lines in METAFONT, using {{recursive}} refinement of paths. METAPOST provides extra primitives {{that can be used}} for this task, but the method presented here can be used for both METAFONT and METAPOST. Introduction Knuth's METAFONT has powerful facilities for manipulating and drawing curves or `paths'. These facilities are generally sufficient for METAFONT's primary intended purpose, namely drawing letters. However, METAFONT is also very well suited to producing technical diagrams; for this secondary purpose, METAFONT lacks a valuable facility [...] -that of drawing evenly dotted and <b>dashed</b> <b>curves.</b> In this paper we show how to remedy this shortcoming, using the facilities that METAFONT does have available. John Hobby's METAPOST is an adaptation of METAFONT for producing PostScript output rather than bitmaps. METAPOST was primarily intended for producing technical diagrams (Don Hosek reports Hobby as saying, `Well, you could use it for g [...] ...|$|R

50|$|To make clearer {{what happens}} as the random error in a {{measurement}} variable increases, consider Figure 4, where {{the standard deviation}} of the time measurements is increased to 0.15 s, or about ten percent. The PDF for the estimated g values is also graphed, {{as it was in}} Figure 2; note that the PDF for the larger-time-variation case is skewed, and now the biased mean is clearly seen. The approximated (biased) mean and the mean observed directly from the data agree well. The <b>dashed</b> <b>curve</b> is a Normal PDF with mean and variance from the approximations; it does not represent the data particularly well.|$|E
30|$|The two decay {{components}} can be {{well defined}} by the bi-exponential fitting of the time-resolved spectra (Fig.  3 b, gray <b>dashed</b> <b>curves).</b> For example, for the QDs at 0  V, the two components of the PL lifetime are 4.2 and 15.2  ns, respectively assigned to the core emission and surface emission [32 – 34]. The latter is due to charge transfer to the trap sites located on the shell or at the core/shell interface [35, 36].|$|R
50|$|Fans {{generally}} have two published specifications: {{free air flow}} and maximum differential pressure. Free air flow {{is the amount of}} air a fan will move with zero back-pressure. Maximum differential pressure is the amount of pressure a fan can generate when completely blocked. In between these two extremes are a series of corresponding measurements of flow versus pressure which is usually presented as a graph. Each fan model will have a unique <b>curve,</b> like the <b>dashed</b> <b>curves</b> in the adjacent illustration.|$|R

5000|$|As is good {{practice}} in these studies, the results above can be checked with a simulation. Figure 3 shows a histogram of 10000 samples of z, with the PDF given above also graphed; {{the agreement is}} excellent. In this simulation the x data had a mean of 10 and {{a standard deviation of}} 2. Thus the naive expected value for z would of course be 100. The [...] "biased mean" [...] vertical line is found using the expression above for μz, and it agrees well with the observed mean (i.e., calculated from the data; dashed vertical line), and the biased mean is above the [...] "expected" [...] value of 100. The <b>dashed</b> <b>curve</b> shown in this figure is a Normal PDF that will be addressed later.|$|E
5000|$|For discussion, we will {{consider}} an ideal, frictionless, rectangular channel. For each value of q, a unique curve can be produced where M is shown {{as a function of}} depth. As is the case for specific energy, the minimum value of uM, uMmin, corresponds to critical depth. For each value of uM greater than uMmin, there are two depths that can occur. These are called conjugate depths, and represent supercritical and subcritical alternatives for flow of a given uM. Since hydraulic jumps conserve momentum, if the depth at the upstream or downstream end of a hydraulic jump is known, we can determine the unknown depth by drawing a vertical line through the known depth and reading its conjugate. The M-y diagram below shows three M-y curves with unit discharge 10, 15and 20 ft2/s. It can be observed that the M-y curves shift in positive M axis as the q value increases. From the M-y equation mentioned earlier, as y increases to infinity, the q2 / gy1 term would be negligible, and the M value will converge to 0.5y2 (shown as the black <b>dashed</b> <b>curve</b> in M-y diagram). By taking the derivative dM / dy = 0, we can also obtain the equation of minimum M with different q values: ...|$|E

The time-step parameter η = 10 − 1, 10 − 2, 10 − 3 and 10 − 4 for subsequent curves. The Hermite integrations show a similar behaviour as the Brutus results, which could imply that the rate of divergence is a physical property of the configuration, rather than a property of the integrator.|$|R
30|$|When {{white noise}} with zero {{correlation}} was used instead, good reliability {{could also be}} obtained (<b>dashed</b> <b>curves</b> in Figs.  3 a and c). But a larger SD value is required if one wants {{to achieve the same}} level of reliability. This suggests that higher noise intensity helps improve the reliability. However, at identical noise intensity correlated noise leads to higher reliability. An optimal correlation time exists for the Type II model. The mechanism underlying the improved reliability at higher values of the correlation time is not known. However, one potential explanation is provided later in this paper.|$|R
