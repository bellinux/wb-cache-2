40|$|To {{promote the}} {{development}} and application of renewable energy, under the planning and execution of Bureau of Energy of Ministry of Economical Affairs (BOEMOEA), Taiwan has implemented many measures for subsidizing the installation of RE apparatus since 2000. Besides subsidizing the installing expenses, Taiwanese government also provides incentive measures of finance/tax, such as <b>investment</b> <b>deduction</b> and accelerating depreciation. The successive growth {{of the amount of}} installing cases has apparently constructed the base of promotion and application of renewable energy; on the other hand, many barriers to be overcome were continuously discovered during the executing processes. To effectively remove these promoting barriers, the Energy Commission (the pre-BOE) issued "Renewable Energy Development Plan" through the endorsement of Executive Yuan in January 2002. The purpose of this plan is to establish an inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism of a higher administrative level, which may focus all resources to be functioned as a working team. In the meantime, to further establish a systematically promoting mechanism, the Bureau of Energy then pushes the legislation of "Renewable Energy Development Bill". According to the drafted plan of this law, the power capacity of renewable energies will be 12 % share of the national power installation capacity by 2020. Furthermore, in the Nuclear-free Homeland National Conference held in June 2003, government planned that the power capacity of renewable energy must reach 10 % of the total power capacity in the nation by 2010. However, the share of the power capacity of renewable energy to the national power installation capacity is only 6. 17 %, currently, so there is still a lot of growing space for the development of renewable energy in Taiwan.

40|$|Do tax {{incentives}} {{for science and}} technology stimulate additional investment? We use detailed data on applications and acceptances for R&D {{tax incentives}}, a special survey, {{and for the first}} time, the science and technology module from the 2000 - 2002 Survey of Manufacturers database in Colombia to analyze this question. We estimate the effect of the R&D tax deduction instituted in Colombia using Zellner''s Seemingly Unrelated Regressions method, and find that the elasticity of demand of R&D investment in manufacturing is quite high in Colombia compared to other countries, particularly for smaller firms, but that the direct benefit from existing policies is minimal. Overall, the results of the paper suggest that there is a great potential for such incentives to promote R&D investment in Colombia, but in their current form, they fail to target those firms that could benefit the most.

"In 1986, when President Ronald Reagan {{and both}} parties on Capitol Hill {{agreed to a}} major change in the tax system, the law was subtly changed to aim at a wholly {{different}} set of deductions, the ones that everyone gets, like the personal exemption, state and local taxes, the standard deduction, certain expenses like union dues and even some medical costs for the seriously ill.

40|$|Germany's old-age {{retirement}} system {{is based on}} three pillars: the statutory pension scheme, company pension schemes (CPS), and private retirement funds. The current government's coalition agreement expressly foresees a strengthening of CPS since its popularity has heavily stagnated in recent years. The intention is to optimize the fiscal and social insurance-related framework for CPS {{in an attempt to}} encourage its wider use. The present expert opinion is a contribution towards this effort. There is considerable potential for this especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and earners of low and very low incomes, since these groups are disproportionately under-represented when it comes to CPS takeup. In light of this, this opinion gives priority to these target groups. The study is structured as follows. First, a comprehensive literature review is provided and guided interviews with experts performed in order to identify obstacles to the continued spread of CPS among the target groups under review. Then, interviews are held with employers in the SME category as well as earners of low and very low incomes in order to verify the obstacles identified during the first step and consider any additional insights. On this basis, the authors consider which reforms may prove effective in addressing the identified obstacles. Here, as instructed, any potential reforms should endeavor not to create a financial burden on Germanyâ€™s tax and social insurance authorities. We then subject these reform ideas to an empirical review that involves interviews with SME tax advisers and again with earners of low and very low incomes. Having analyzed these interviews and discussing additional practical considerations, we explicitly recommend the implementation of selected reforms. In doing so, the authors propose the following two concrete recommendations. Recommendation 1 suggests introducing a mandatory employer contribution on top of deferred compensation that corresponds to the amount of social insurance contributions that are saved as a result, of which employees would be the obvious beneficiaries. This would result in an increase in employers' financial burden compared to the status quo. To compensate, a "CPS deduction" would be introduced as a tax incentive for small enter-prises that decide to introduce a CPS for their employees. This deduction would function similarly to the <b>investment</b> <b>deduction</b> option afforded under Section 7 g of the German Income Tax Act, resulting in a positive liquidity and tax deferment effect for small enterprises. Recommendation 2 aims at incentivizing employees to participate in a CPS. Two alternatives are offered. Either Germany's existing Riester subsidy system could be better integrated into CPS schemes by eliminating the duplication of contributions that exists under the status quo. Alternatively, a "CPS subsidy" could be introduced. This would involve granting a statutory subsidy to employers that contribute a certain minimum amount to the CPS on behalf of their employees. As a consequence, employees would be able to participate in a CPS without having to make a contribution of their own, which would have the desired effect especially for earners of low and very low incomes. In connection with Recommendation 2, the authors mention two additional aspects that ought to be implemented for the benefit of employees. One, a restriction should be placed {{on the extent to which}} CPS payments are set off against basic social security payments. Two, the acquisition costs of insurance-based CPS solutions should be spread across the entire term of the agreement, meaning that no commission fees can be retained that relate to contributions that haven't yet been made. Finally, the authors recommend two measures that serve to flexibilize and simplify the legal framework surrounding CPS: an increase in the tax- and social insurance contribution-exempt total outlay in the presence of insurance-based external funding and, related to this, a switch from an annualized to a lifetime- or length-of-service-based approach. Angesichts der demografischen Entwicklung setzt die Bundesregierung zur SchlieÃŸung der drohenden RentenlÃ¼cke auch auf die betriebliche Altersversorgung (bAV). Dieses Gutachten entwickelt Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber zur Optimierung der steuer- und sozialversicherungsrechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen der bAV. Die Zielvorgabe lautet, die Verbreitung der bAV unter Gering- und Niedrigverdienern zu erhÃ¶hen und kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen als Arbeitgeber Anreize zu setzen, ihren Arbeitnehmern ein bAV-Angebot zu unterbreiten. Das Gutachten schafft einen umfassenden Ãœberblick Ã¼ber bestehende Hemmnisse fÃ¼r diese beiden Zielgruppen, an der bAV zu partizipieren. Auf dieser Basis werden zehn ReformÃ¼berlegungen erarbeitet und auf ihre Wirkungen hin geprÃ¼ft. Hieraus ergeben sich jeweils eine Handlungsempfehlung fÃ¼r die Arbeitgeber- und die Arbeitnehmerseite. AuÃŸerdem werden Ansatzpunkte fÃ¼r eine Vereinfachung der steuer- und sozialversicherungsrechtlichen Regelungen aufgezeigt.

40|$|Leverage is an {{essential}} but often troubling component of the U. S. market. The financial crisis highlighted the risks and complexity of a leverage web that includes flesh-and-blood {{people from all walks}} of life and paper people from all corners of the business and investment world. In the tax area, the potentially problematic incentive effects of interest deductibility have long engaged a wide array of tax commentators and policymakers. While interest deductibility rightly receives widespread scrutiny, a more comprehensive approach to leverage is needed. This Article focuses on the surprisingly complicated tax treatment of cash (and cash equivalent) borrowings. This Article highlights that the current tax treatment of debt principal used to finance business and <b>investment</b> <b>deductions</b> yields favorable tax timing mismatches for taxpayers and thereby theoretically amplifies any distortions caused by the deductibility of debt interest. The tax systemâ€™s current approach to debt-financed tax benefits reflects reactive responses to particular forms of tax avoidance. The current systemâ€™s reliance on a factor drawn from tax avoidance case lawâ€” likelihood of repaymentâ€”has led to an inherently flawed set of tax rules. For example, the at-risk rules identify nonrecourse debt as problematic and then impose timing limitations on tax benefits financed only with that debt type even though potential timing distortions are embedded in all cash borrowings. Thus, the at-risk rules treat nonrecourse debt as simultaneously bona fide and suspect, yet whether an agreement constitutes bona fide debt still must be determined using a facts-andcircumstances, case-by-case analysis. The resulting tax rules relating directly to debt principal are confusing and inconsistent. The rules also invite extensive tax planning, whether legitimate or avoidant. The main tax problems relating to debt principalâ€”the timing distortion and the possibility of sham debtâ€”should be addressed as distinct issues with priority given to the timing issue. Giving renewed attention to resolving the timing distortion would facilitate a comprehensive approach to debt and would also have the likely side benefit of making sham debt less attractive. This Article examines multiple proposals for directly limiting timing benefits. Solving timing distortions for even simple cash debt is quite difficult. Thus, this Article details a more accurate, more complex reform avenue but also suggests a simpler, rougher justice one as well. The more complex approach rations the use of borrowed basis while the simpler approach utilizes a deferral charge. In addition, this Article briefly reviews (and rejects) two other possibilitiesâ€”treating all debt as lacking basis and treating cash equivalent debt as income on receipt. If it is not currently possible to implement broader reform proposals, incremental reform that distinguishes more carefully between the underlying timing distortion and tax avoidance behavior could bring greater coherence to the taxing problem of debt principal...|$|R

40|$|Although the tax {{reforms of}} the 1980 s {{substantially}} lowered the excess burden caused by high marginal tax rates, there were also significant adverse effects on incentives to save and to invest in business plant and equipment. Effective tax rates on. real capital gains and real net interest income remain very high because the tax rules do not recognize the difference between real and nominal magnitudes. These high effective tax rates discourage personal saving. The paper discusses {{a number of ways}} in which the tax law could be modified to encourage more saving and less borrowing. Existing tax rules bias corporate decisions in favor of debt finance relative to equity finance and in favor of investments in intangible assets (like advertising, consumer goodwill, and R and D) relative to investments in plant and equipment. The paper discusses the use of a cashflow corporate tax (with complete expensing of <b>investment</b> and no <b>deduction</b> for interest payments) as a way of remedying both of these biases in our current tax law. ...|$|R
