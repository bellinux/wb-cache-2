40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>finance</b> {{is money}} {{allocated}} by the Department of Health to NHS authorities to promote policies of inter-agency collaboration which prevent people being admitted to hospital or facilitate earlier {{discharge from hospital}} or save on NHS resources generally. Worries have been expressed that <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> has not been used as effectively or efficiency {{as it might have}} been. This paper is concerned with the practical application of cost-effectiveness analysis to policies or schemes which typically use <b>joint</b> <b>finance.</b> Intensive case-studies with five English local authorities and seven NHS authorities attempted to apply cost-effectiveness analysis to items contained in their <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> programmes over the period 1981 - 87. In some cases it was possible to find self-contained schemes which benefited from such an appraisal, but it also found that there were several features about the programme which either ruled out the case of cost-effectiveness analysis or indicated the need to analyse policies which were funded in part but not wholly by <b>joint</b> <b>finance.</b> Cost-effectiveness analysis was particularly difficult to apply where <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> was used to fund relatively minor items such as a small, one-off grant to voluntary organisations or when it was used to increase the provision of existing services such as home help or residential care, since it is generally accepted that these services meet a well-recognised need. The most fruitful use of cost-effectiveness analysis occurred where <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> was used to develop new services in a particular locality and comparisons were available of similar services in other localities. The general lesson of the work was that economic appraisal needs to be targeted at major service provision {{which may or may not}} use <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> rather than just at the <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> programme. <b>joint</b> <b>finance...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>finance</b> is {{a source}} of National Health Service money which has been {{targeted}} by the department of Health and Social Security to be spent on community care. In particular it is to be used by agencies (statutory and non-statutory) in collaboration with the health service to facilitate the phasing out of long-stay hospital institutions by replacing these services with more appropriate facilities in the community. <b>Joint</b> <b>finance</b> has come under much criticism over the role it plays in supporting community care initiatives. The critics argue that the transitional costs necessary to support two parallel services as the balance of care shifts, involves a scale of financial support greatly in excess of that which <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> can provide. Although this is certainly true for major transformers of resources away from institutions, this is being particularly critical of the <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> programme. There have been limited successes obvious from this programme. Furthermore, given that the requirement of flexibility is necessary in meeting individual needs in the community, then <b>joint</b> <b>finance,</b> in relation to this range of needs has a definite supporting role. This role is, however, limited by the size and structure of the <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> budget. This paper analyses some data from <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> programmes in seven non-London health authorities. By analysing these data in terms of the beneficiaries of the programmes, the agencies involved, the nature of community services provided and the financial arrangements used in funding projects, the relationship between <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> and community care is examined more closely. The results suggest that <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> has been instrumental in pump-priming the development and improvement of day services, respite services and primary health services for elderly and mentally handicapped people. Furthermore, these service developments and improvements tend to predominate in areas of service provision for groups already living in the community requiring long-term care or for those considered at risk of future hospitalisation rather than for the direct transfer of people out of long-stay hospitals. There {{is no reason to believe}} that this role will not or would not be extended in the future to provide care for other priority groups, particularly mentally ill and physically handicapped people, who have tended to be ignored in existing <b>joint</b> <b>finance</b> programmes. <b>joint</b> <b>finance...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the adoption of the}} Comprehensive Program, Comecon made some progress toward strengthening market relations among members. The Comprehensive Program's objectives proved somewhat inconsistent with the predominant trends within members' economies in the 1970s, which was a period of recentralization — rather than decentralization — of domestic systems of planning and management. The major exception to this lack of progress lay in the area of intra-Comecon pricing and payment, where the expansion of relations with the West contributed to the adoption of prices and extra-plan settlements closer to international norms. Achievements under the Comprehensive Program have fallen under the heading of planned approaches, especially in the area of joint resource development projects. A second Comecon bank, the International Investment Bank, was established in 1970 to provide a mechanism for the <b>joint</b> <b>financing</b> of such projects. In 1973 Comecon decided to draw up a general plan incorporating these measures. A number of projects formulated in the years immediately following adoption of the Comprehensive Program were then assembled in a document signed at the 29th Council Session in 1975. Entitled the [...] "Concerted Plan for Multilateral Integration Measures," [...] the document covered the 1976-80 five-year-plan period and was proclaimed as the first general plan for the Comecon economies. The joint projects included in the plan were largely completed {{in the course of the}} plan period.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of “One budget” in HSDP III and beyond means all available funding for health activities (government and donor sources) are effectively pooled and should flow through government channels. Another {{important feature of}} the one budget principle is all of these funds for health activities should be reflected in only one plan and one documented budget, although actual funding disbursement may be effected through separate channels. Subsequent to {{the signing of the}} IHP+ Compact, a joint decision between the FMOH and the health development partners has led to undertaking an independent assessment of the health system focusing on financial administration, procurement, equity and social inclusion with an intention of filling the prevailing resource gaps. This assessment has resulted in the establishment of the MDG Performance Fund which was the hallmark towards reaching an agreement for a one-budget framework in the health sector of Ethiopia. The key findings of the assessment were capacity limitations at PPFGD, Finance and Audit section of the FMOH, and PFSA that impeded efforts to enhance performances as per the requirement of the reform design. Another finding was the slow pace in the scaling up of HMIS and M&E. Relevant recommendations have been forwarded for mitigating these challenges and have been documented as part of POA of FMOH. Furthermore, FMOH and Development Partners have developed a <b>Joint</b> <b>Financing</b> Arrangement (JFA) for the establishment of the MDG Performance Fund that has been signed by Seven Development Partners which has led the FMOH accessing and make use of the pooled funds.|$|E
