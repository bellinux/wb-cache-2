500|$|Several of Edmondson's Holby City co-stars have {{described}} feeling {{intimidated by the}} prospect of working alongside him for the first time, stemming from his already well established fame. Rakie Ayola explained: [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be difficult at the beginning because he wasn't speaking to me. But he was initially just a little shy and sussing things out. He's a lot quieter than you would expect but then suddenly he'll say something that has everybody doubled up <b>in</b> <b>laughter.</b> You won't find anyone who doesn't like him." [...] Edmondson himself has added that he gets along well with the cast, although finds that the distance of Elstree Studios from most of their London homes makes them [...] "weirdly unsociable".|$|E
500|$|The book {{continued}} to garner positive reviews and comments. In 1998, Amanda Foreman wrote for The Sunday Times of London, [...] "I want to shout about The Phantom from the rooftops. I {{want to stand}} in Waterloo and press copies into people's hands. This is a book that should be in every home.... Whether you are 8 or 88 Juster's mixture of allegorical wisdom and logical whimsy will take you on a journey of the spirit. The Phantom is a mappa mundi of our hearts, proving once again that <b>in</b> <b>laughter</b> and simplicity lies the truth of life". In a 2011 article written for the book's fiftieth anniversary, Adam Gopnik wrote, [...] "The book is made magical by Juster's and Feiffer's gift for transforming abstract philosophical ideas into unforgettable images." ...|$|E

500|$|Financial writer Roger Nusbaum {{said the}} episode {{was not only}} [...] "humorous" [...] but {{provided}} a decent analysis of the recession. He particularly praised Randy's inclusion of margaritas with the barest of necessities; Nusbaum said most people tend to take on absurd expenses that they fail to realize are unnecessary, even as they discuss {{the plight of the}} economy. Brad Trechak of TV Squad called [...] "Margaritaville" [...] a highlight of the season. Mike Fahey of Kotaku said the episode had [...] "a clever little plot". Zac Bissonnette of BloggingStocks said of the episode, [...] "It isn't quite as trenchant as some of the other Wall Street satire that's been making the rounds, but it's definitely worth watching." [...] Carlos Delgado of If magazine said the episode included many excellent moments, including the headless chicken method of making economic decisions, but otherwise felt [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was not as strong as previous episodes like [...] "The Ring". Delgado said, [...] "Maybe I'm too depressed about the current economic situation, who knows, but although 'Margaritaville' was well written and poignant, I wasn't bursting out <b>in</b> <b>laughter</b> every two minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|Mos Def {{collaborated with}} singer Georgia Anne Muldrow and rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli—his {{partner in the}} rap duo Black Star. Muldrow sang and played piano on [...] "Roses", which she {{originally}} wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album Umsindo (2009). She said Mos Def [...] "borrowed" [...] the song for The Ecstatic after they met through a mutual friend. [...] "They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. He snatched it up real quick", she recalled <b>in</b> <b>laughter.</b> Along with Madlib, Oh No, and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of Stones Throw Records; according to journalist Nathan Rabin, they collectively produced half of the album, giving its sound a [...] "sympathetic" [...] quality. With The Ecstatic, Mos Def {{said he wanted to}} offer listeners sincere, uninhibited observations about life and love, [...] "some truth and positive heart lift", without the need for club songs. [...] "No disrespect to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted <b>in</b> <b>laughter.</b> Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

More importantly, we quantify the occurrence of <b>laughter</b> <b>in</b> this new domain, and contrast our observations with findings for <b>laughter</b> <b>in</b> multi-party meetings. Our analyses show that, with respect to the majority of measures we explore, the occurrence of <b>laughter</b> <b>in</b> both domains is quite similar. 1...|$|R

Arsenal's cup run started with a home tie against their north London rivals, Tottenham Hotspur. Goals from Santi Cazorla and Tomáš Rosický either side of half time meant Arsenal won 2–0; the match was marred by a long-term injury to winger Theo Walcott. In the fourth round, the team was drawn against Coventry City of Football League One, at the Emirates Stadium.

Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt <b>in</b> <b>laughter.</b> [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E

2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, {{and you can hear}} people in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted <b>in</b> <b>laughter</b> over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers and staring at them. She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case. She was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and an $8,600 fine.|$|E
