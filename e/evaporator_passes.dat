Reactivity, energetic activation, and the coating composition and structure are controlled and kept constant by influencing the plasma density. According to the invention, the vapour propagated by the <b>evaporator</b> <b>passes</b> through a plasma generated between electrodes and is brought into interaction with the latter. The electrodes consist of evaporating material or a component and/or dopant material of the coating to be applied. The plasma is maintained in the vapour of the evaporating material and/or inert gas. The process is used for refining the surfaces of semi-finished products and finished products, in particular to produce oxide coatings with a barrier effect on plastic films for the packing industry...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase {{ejectors}} are devices {{capable of}} improving the performance of refrigeration and air conditioning cycles by means of expansion work recovery. Ejector studies often focus on the design and performance of the two-phase ejector and the effect it can have {{on the performance of}} the ejector cycle. However, the ejector is not the only component of the system that can have a significant influence on the performance of the ejector cycle. Recent experimental work has shown that the effect of evaporator design on ejector cycle performance can be quite significant, though there is very little research available on the relation between evaporator design and ejector cycle performance. In this paper, a numerical model of a microchannel air-to-refrigerant evaporator, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects, is developed and used to investigate the effect that different evaporator dimensions have on the performance of ejector cycles. The model is validated with experimental data from previous ejector cycle studies. There are two ejector cycles of interest: The standard ejector cycle, in which the ejector is used to directly lift the compressor suction pressure, and the ejector recirculation cycle, in which the ejector recirculates excess liquid through the evaporator but does not directly lift compressor suction pressure. The effects of microchannel port hydraulic diameter, number of <b>evaporator</b> <b>passes,</b> refrigerant outlet state, and air-side resistance are investigated. The analysis is performed with refrigerants R 134 a and CO 2 (R 744) in order to demonstrate how proper evaporator and ejector cycle design is different for different refrigerants...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two-phase flow patterns and droplet entrainment in a horizontal-tube evaporator was conducted. The study {{is an element of}} the worldwide change from the current generation of refrigerants to chemicals with reduced ozone-depletion and global-warming potential. Measurements were made with serpentine aluminum and glass evaporators with geometries typical of those used for domestic refrigeration. The refrigerant in the majority of tests was R 134 a (tetrafluoroethane), which will replace R 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) for domestic refrigeration and automotive air-conditioning applications in 1995. Baseline data with R 12 and R 22 (chlorodifluoromethane, currently used in residential air conditioners) were also recorded. The phenomenon of primary interest was the non-equilibrium transport of liquid droplets within slightly superheated vapor at the evaporator exit. In sufficient quantity, such liquid would prove detrimental to evaporator performance by increasing the vapor superheat level at a given heat duty and reducing the effective temperature difference between refrigerant and air. Also of concern were substantial variations in carry over rate with time, and corresponding fluctuations in exit temperature. These variations are due to the formation of slugs far upstream in the evaporator which rapidly transport a surplus of liquid toward the exit. A flow loop was constructed to circulate oil-free refrigerant through the evaporator under conditions spanning those of domestic refrigerator operation. Liquid carry over (expressed as a dimensionless entrained mass fraction, or EMF) was measured as a function of inlet quality, heat flux, mass flux and exit superheat level. A laser-based phase/Doppler particle analyzer was used to measure droplet diameters and velocities within an optical probe volume at the evaporator exit. Videotapes and still photographs of flow patterns within the glass evaporator were made. Two types of experiments [...] time-averaged and time-resolved [...] were conducted. The former revealed the quantitative dependence of EMF on the independent variables, while the latter documented the relationship between EMF and flow-regime transitions within the evaporator. Tests with three refrigerants over wide ranges of operating conditions revealed time averaged EMFs of no more than 0. 1 percent Thus, liquid carry over does not significantly affect the performance of the evaporator as a heat exchanger. Analysis of variance (ANDY A) revealed exit superheat to have the strongest effect on entrained mass fraction, followed by mass flux, inlet quality and heat flux. Time-averaged EMFs varied with operating conditions by several orders of magnitude, decreasing with increasing superheat level (due to lower entrainment rates near the exit and more rapid droplet vaporization) and mass flux and inlet quality (due to a lower liquid inventory in the first few <b>evaporator</b> <b>passes).</b> An expression relating EMF to dimensionless forms of the independent variables was developed via nonlinear multiple regression. The incidence of slug flow within the evaporator and its effect on evaporator exit conditions were documented in the time-resolved experiments, using techniques such as autoand cross-correlation and Fourier transform. Time-resolved EMFs as high as one percent were observed, as well as sharp reductions in exit superheat of as much as 8 ??C. These coincided with the arrival at the exit of slug remnants in the form of entrained droplet clusters. The distribution of superheat readings with time was found to follow a Rayleigh probability density function. This finding will facilitate the use of the superheat reading in control strategies, should it become necessary to actively control refrigerant flow rate.

This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of back pressure valves. The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.|$|R

The principle of the method is the following. <b>Evaporator</b> concentrates <b>pass</b> through sorbents, which selectively extract radionuclides. Cleaned from radionuclides, the evaporator concentrates representing a low hazardous chemical waste, are processed and stored at the site for industrial wastes. The influence of different parameters on sorption of cesium and cobalt by inorganic sorbents has been investigated. This radionuclides are the main one in the NPP evaporator concentrates.

50|$|The {{solution}} containing the desired product is {{fed into the}} <b>evaporator</b> and <b>passes</b> across a heat source. The applied heat converts {{the water in the}} solution into vapor. The vapor is removed {{from the rest of the}} solution and is condensed while the now-concentrated solution is either fed into a second evaporator or is removed. The evaporator, as a machine, generally consists of four sections. The heating section contains the heating medium, which can vary. Steam is fed into this section. The most common medium consists of parallel tubes but others have plates or coils typically made from copper or aluminium. The concentrating and separating section removes the vapor being produced from the solution. The condenser condenses the separated vapor, then the vacuum or pump provides pressure to increase circulation.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{freezers}} {{were the}} first {{to be used in the}} food industry and are used in the vast majority of freezing / refrigerating lines. They function by circulating a refrigerant, normally ammonia, around the system, which withdraws heat from the food product. This heat is then transferred to a condenser and dissipated into air or water. The refrigerant itself, now a high pressure, hot liquid, is directed into an <b>evaporator.</b> As it <b>passes</b> through an expansion valve, it is cooled and then vaporises into a gaseous state. Now a low pressure, low temperature gas again, it can be reintroduced into the system.|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} distillation (MD) method {{was developed to}} separate the unsaponifiables from Cottonseed oil deodorizer distillate (CODD), which contains free fatty acids (FFA), mono/diglycerides, tocopherols and sterols. Using a model KDL 6 MD glass still with a 0. 06 m 2 <b>evaporator,</b> five <b>passes</b> were conducted using different evaporator temperatures and with the condenser temperature held at 60 °C and vacuum at 0. 22 mmHg. With the feed rate of 0. 2 kg/hr, at a temperature of 60 °C, samples of the CODD were separated into the distillate and residue portion. Using a gas chromatography silylation method, quantification of the components was determined. The pass 4 distillate was composed of 90. 8 % of FFA and 4. 3 % of unsaponifiables and the residue had 63 % unsaponifiables. Using this residue for stage- 2, unsaponifiables were 84. 5 % of the distillate while the residue had 97. 14 % diglycerides. Molecular distillation is a solvent-free process, avoiding problems with toxicity. This laboratory method using a 2 -stage process successfully distilled the unsaponifiables from the components of CODD and distilled the valuable tocopherols and sterols and the FFA.

40|$|Microchannel heat {{exchangers}} (MCHX) are being increasingly applied in heat pumps {{because of their}} compactness, significant charge reduction, lower refrigerant pressure drop and lower air-side fan power consumption compared to traditional round tube-plate fin (RTPF) {{heat exchangers}}. Using a microchannel condenser as well as evaporator in a heat pump system also offers significant potential for cost reduction. Very few studies on pass optimization of microchannel condensers and evaporators {{have appeared in the}} literature, and even fewer exist on the circuit optimization of dual-mode MCHX used in a heat pump. Â The influence of pass arrangement on the thermal-hydraulic performance of microchannel condensers and evaporators has been explored in this article. A total of 1982 configurations for 18 tube x 1. 124 m, 36 tube x 0. 562 m, and 54 tube x 0. 375 m were simulated under conditions typically encountered by the outdoor unit of a R 410 A refrigerant-to-air heat pump. Two-, three-, and four-pass circuits with contracting, expanding, and equal pass designs were simulated using CoilDesigner. All designs had identical face area to allow a fair assessment of their performance. Â For optimal condenser performance, 36 or 18 tube configurations are preferred to 54 tube designs. The 36 tube- 31 %/ 30 %/ 25 %/ 14 %, 18 tube- 56 %/ 33 %/ 11 %, and 36 tube- 25 %/ 25 %/ 25 %/ 25 % condenser coils have the best heat duty. Contracting or equal pass arrangements are superior to expanding pass arrangements for condensers. Â Â Unlike condensers, 54 or 36 tube configurations yield the best evaporator heat duty. Again, quite contrary to condensers, expanding pass arrangements are clearly favored for optimal evaporator heat duty, and the best expanding pass arrangements significantly outperform the best contracting or equal pass arrangements. The 54 tube, 2 %/ 4 %/ 24 %/ 70 % and 2 %/ 6 %/ 93 % evaporator coils are the best performing ones. Again, unlike in condensers, a strongly disproportionate distribution of tubes among the passes is favored for evaporators, with very few tubes recommended in the first pass or two, and many more tubes in the last <b>pass.</b> Additionally, <b>evaporator</b> performance is found to be much more sensitive to pass arrangement than condenser configurations. Hence, <b>evaporator</b> <b>pass</b> arrangements need more careful consideration than condenser pass arrangements. Â Thus, quite contrary pass designs favor condenser and evaporator performance. This fact implies that to design dual-mode MCHX, as in a heat pump, some compromises will be necessary. Future work will address the performance of dual-mode MCHX at the component and system levels. The influence of air and refrigerant maldistribution on optimal MCHX pass arrangement will also be investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{time goes}} by, {{the idea of}} having {{unlimited}} energy resources becomes less and less feasible. The population of our world and the rate of consumption of resources increase each year. The future has us looking at alternative energy sources that will drive the need for better methods of extraction of natural energy’s like wind, water, solar, geothermal heat, and other various types of natural resources. There is a need to focus on developing more energy efficiency of current products to lessen the demand on current energy sources. Primarily powered by electricity, one of the areas to focus on energy efficiency is the heat pump water heater (HPWH). In the Northwest states (Washington, Montana, Oregon, Idaho) about sixty to sixty five percent of households use electricity as the primary source of power. Heating water can consume anywhere from fifteen to twenty five percent of the home total energy consumption. The engineering behind the HPWH doesn’t generate its own heat while running. Rather the HPWH uses the ambient air surrounding the water heater and functions in revers of a refrigeration or air conditioning system. According to Energy star: “HPWH takes the heat from surrounding air and transfers it to water in an enclosed tank. A low-pressure liquid refrigerant is vaporized in the heat pump 2 ̆ 7 s <b>evaporator</b> and <b>passed</b> into the compressor. As the pressure of the refrigerant increases, so does its temperature. The heated refrigerant runs through a condenser coil within the storage tank, transferring heat to the water stored there. As the refrigerant delivers its heat to the water, it cools and condenses, and then passes through an expansion valve where the pressure is reduced and the cycle starts over. ” Research Question: Why has the HPWH had such a slow or low adoption rate in society? Research Objective: There are factors and sub factors that are affecting the adoption of the Heat Pump Water Heater. The factors we have identified are economic, politic, social, technical and environmental. The sub-factors (elements) will be constructed at a later time and into the HDM model to find the causes that affect the adoption of heat pump water heater...|$|R
