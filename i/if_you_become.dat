2500|$|Another key {{ingredient}} {{was his own}} presence as a master; [...] "A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy. … He never does anything to the disciple." [...] The initiation he offered was another such device: [...] "... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. … It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a disciple." [...] Ultimately though, as an explicitly [...] "self-parodying" [...] guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching {{to be nothing more}} than a [...] "game" [...] or a joke. He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> {{personally}} {{interested in}} the problems, it's as bad as if you hadn't the materials of judgment left; you're prejudiced. Besides, I doubt my youthfulness very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is the use}} {{of asking}} me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> angry when I answer? If you do not wish to do what I say, then try your own attempt. At least you cannot say that I have not done all I could to save you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What we {{tell you}} is for your good," [...] added Bessie, in no harsh voice, [...] "you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, {{you would have a}} home here; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure." ...|$|E

50|$|Consider {{an example}} {{regarding}} reinstatement: say you learned {{an aversion to}} mangos because you got sick after eating one on a trip. Extinction of the aversion would result <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have frequent instances of eating bits of mangos without getting sick on many occasions. Reinstatement suggests that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>became</b> sick again for some reason, the aversion to mangos would return even if your illness {{had nothing to do}} with eating mangos. In this example, after extinction, presentation of the US (the experience of being sick) brings about the conditioned behaviour to be aversive to mangos.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not mean}} to say that you will {{have nothing to do with}} me," [...] said Lydia, {{stopping}} her quietly. [...] "Why are you so scrupulous, Miss Goff?

60|$|PATIOMKIN [thunderously; {{springing}} to his feet]. It is a lie: Orloff murdered him. [Subsiding a little.] He also knocked my eye out; but [sitting down placidly] I succeeded him for all that.

6000|$|... "Miss Wilson," [...] he replied, unruffled, [...] "if {{you insist}} on Smilash, you shall have Smilash; I take an insane {{pleasure}} in personating him. If you want Sidney--my real Christian name--you can command him. But allow {{me to say that}} you must have either one or the other. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> frank with me, I will understand that you are addressing Sidney.

6000|$|... "You {{wonder that}} the Major did not tell you, Miss Greendale. I asked him, myself. When you think it over, you will {{understand}} why he could not tell you; for he had no actual proof, save the dying girl's words and what I had seen and heard; and his motive in telling {{it might have been}} misunderstood. But he told me that, even at the risk of that, he should feel it his duty, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>became</b> engaged to that villain, to tell the story to Lady Greendale.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, madam! What do I {{know about}} slaves? No {{one is a}} slave in England. No madam; all that it does is to make me long to cut half-a-dozen fellows' throats--" [...] and Scoutbush stamped with rage. [...] "No, madam, you are you: and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> my viscountess, you take my rank, I trust, and my name is yours, and my family yours; and let me see who dare interfere!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, never; not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> his wife. I {{have loved}} {{you as well}} as he does. When Mrs Dale told me of it, I thought I should have fallen. I went away without seeing you because I was unable to speak to you. I made a fool of myself, and have been a fool all along. I am foolish now to tell you this, but I cannot help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{use such}} conveniences {{of life as}} come to them naturally,' said Honor, who had {{lived long enough to}} be afraid of the freaks of asceticism. 'Hear me, Robert. You are not wise in {{thrusting}} aside all that brings home to you your little sister's love. You think it cannot be forgotten, but it is not well to cast away these daily memorials. I know you have much to make you severe--nay, morose--but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> so, you will never do your work efficiently. You may repel, but never invite; frighten, but not soothe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not talk}} so!" [...] cried Grace. [...] "It frightens me; it puzzles me, and makes me miserable. Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would but <b>become</b> a Christian!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. For instance, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>become</b> {{absolutely}} discredited, I {{think that}} you would be effectually out of my way. Your people do not forgive." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If, bhikkhus, others {{speak in}} dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, {{you should not}} give way to resentment, displeasure, or {{animosity}} against them in your heart. For <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>become</b> angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>become</b> angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would {{you be able to}} recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] shouted Bastin from {{a little}} distance, [...] "I am quite aware of that, as you have often said so before. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> one, I am sorry to say that I do not {{see how you can}} expect any benefit.

The extra nineteen shillings will do him no good at all, since in his heart he regrets the error and wishes that he could have them back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another thing is, {{you may get}} {{involved}} in affairs of honour. I consider duelling to be a foolish practice, {{but it is no}} use one person standing up against a crowd. It is the fashion, in our days, to fight duels and, therefore, it is almost a necessity for a gentleman to be able to shoot straight; besides, although {{you might be able to}} avoid fighting a duel with any of your countrymen, there is no possibility of getting out of it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> involved in a quarrel with a foreigner.

6000|$|He had {{two years}} {{previously}} preached at Oxford the assize sermon on National Apostasy, which Newman marks {{as the beginning}} of the awakening of the country to church doctrine and practice. He and his brother were known as contributors to the Tracts for the Times, which were rousing the clergy in the same direction, but which were so much misunderstood, and excited so much obloquy, that Mr. Norris of Hackney, himself a staunch old-fashioned churchman, who had held up the light in evil times, said to his young friend, the Rev. Robert Francis Wilson, a first-class Oriel man, to whom the curacy of Hursley had been offered, [...] "Now remember <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> Keble's curate, you will lose all chance of preferment for life." ...|$|E

[...] "It doesn't follow that you'll be awarded {{the whole of}} it, but it's generally admitted that one shouldn't be too modest in sending in a claim. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> two <b>become</b> partners <b>you</b> could buy a ranch." ...|$|R

[...] Looking Horse called upon President Obama to keep his word: When you met with our people on your campaign trail in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you stated that you are a lawyer and understand treaty documents.
