5|$|Among 1537-base <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{sequence}} of the M segment, several variable sites were observed, including some non-silent mutations. The sequence differs by 8 to 10% from BAYV, CATV, and BCCV in terms of amino acids and by 22% in terms of nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Loughor Castle is {{controlled}} by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The ruined tower and <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curtain wall still survive on top of the ringwork's earthwork defences, which now resemble a motte, or mound, and are part of the Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|The legend that Joseph of Arimathea {{retrieved}} certain holy relics {{was introduced}} by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, {{thought to have been}} a trilogy though only <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.|$|E

5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|During the Jin–Song wars, {{the invading}} Jurchens sacked the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng in 1126 AD, and an {{enormous}} amount of prized literature found in the Imperial Library was lost, including the original copy of the Wujing Zongyao. After the original was lost, only a few manuscripts survived {{as a result of its}} secretive nature. Only a few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands. A remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original with other material.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work survive, {{having been}} quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes {{note of the}} work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E

5|$|In May 1975, during {{restoration}} work, {{the monks}} of Saint Catherine's Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland {{and his team}} from the Institute for New Testament Textual Research were the first scholars who exclusively were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Testament in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete leaves from the Sinaiticus, 11 leaves of the Pentateuch and 1 leaf of the Shepherd of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of New Testament have been found (uncials 0278 – 0296 and some minuscules).|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis}} of allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on the margins of the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|Maclagen {{sent the}} 11th Battalion, Captain Joseph Lalor's {{company of the}} 12th Battalion and Major James Robertson's of the 9th, towards Baby 700. Brockman divided his own company, sending half up the right fork of Rest Gully, and half up the left, while Brockman and a reserve platoon headed up Monash Valley. As they moved forward, Turkish {{artillery}} targeted them with air burst shrapnel shells, which dispersed the companies. This, coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards Baby 700, meant only <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> units eventually reached Baby 700.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{depicted}} {{many important}} {{figures of the}} Polish Renaissance period including taking the liberty to include at least one who were not actually present at the event. In a similar vein, although the event portrayed took place in 1525, Matejko painted <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sukiennice in Renaissance style, a form that dates from the year 1555, after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style. St. Mary's Basilica is visible in the background.|$|E
5|$|Police {{investigators}} under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment {{removed from}} a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home. A metal nut and <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg. Schaack concluded, {{on the basis of}} interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period.

5|$|School District 53 Okanagan Similkameen {{consists}} of ten schools, five {{of which are}} elementary, three are high or secondary schools, while two are alternative schools, within {{a total of six}} communities in British Columbia, Canada, in <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern Okanagan and lower Similkameen regions. The schools of the latter region include Cawston Primary School—held in the town of Cawston—whose principal is Linda Thiel, who also served as a principal for the Hedley Elementary School—held in the Hedley town—before its closure in January 2008, after the Okanagan Similkammeen district voted four to two to close the school.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century archaeological {{excavations}} {{have taken}} place in the priory grounds, though a substantial part of the site has not yet been investigated. In addition to the east window, surviving visible <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex include the lower courses of the west range, a vaulted undercroft, a gateway and a 14th-century dovecote still in use today. The adjoining Priory Gardens, laid out by the Chaloners in the 18th century, are under restoration by a volunteer group. The priory ruins and gardens {{are open to the public}} throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priory {{travelled}} further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin {{was built}} incorporating sculptured stones {{brought from the}} priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{text of the}} {{manuscript}} contains <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed uncial script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E
5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E
5|$|The only {{remaining}} {{parts of the}} medieval castle left today is the 10 metre (33feet) high motte, which rests on the highest point in the city, and some <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding earthworks.
