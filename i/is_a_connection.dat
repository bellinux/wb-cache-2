5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} data {{indicate}} that the basaltic lava flows of the Central Atlantic magmatic province in Morocco were erupted at c. 200nbsp&Ma and spanned the Tr-J boundary.

40|$|The {{research}} {{provides a}} basic view for guidelines and frameworks that address Electronic Government’s (E-Government) definition, characteristics and type. It also gives impetus for resources that enable E-Government’s planning, design, and implementation through reviewing E-Government simulation. This E-Government system has <b>been</b> designed as <b>a</b> network consisting of three major parts. The first one <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between clients (citizens & businesses), and servers (government ministries), this <b>connection</b> system used <b>a</b> TCP/IP communication protocol through an Internet. The second part <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between servers (government ministries) and another server called Certification Authority(CA). This <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> performed through <b>a</b> Local Area Network (LAN). While {{the third part}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the clients (users) and the Certification Authority(CA). This <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> performed through <b>an</b> Internet. The E-Government design needs a high security system to protect the whole network...|$|R

25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs show that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between beliefs and knowledge. He gives {{the example of a}} woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to believe her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E
25|$|According to Hindu tradition, the Rigvedic hymns were {{collected}} by Paila {{under the guidance of}} , who formed the Rigveda Samhita as we know it. According to the , the number of syllables in the Rigveda is 432,000, equalling the number of muhurtas (1 day = 30 muhurtas) in forty years. This statement stresses the underlying philosophy of the Vedic books that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> (bandhu) between the astronomical, the physiological, and the spiritual.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between Dejection and Frost at Midnight in {{everything}} but its form. This is primarily true {{of the original}} version, {{but many of the}} personal elements of the poem continue over into the published version. The trimming of the poem allows for Coleridge to emphasize the most important poetic aspects of the original and to create a separation of the form from the subject area which allows for a strong incongruity not in the original.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck's work {{includes}} {{the invention of}} the étale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation of André Weil's that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.|$|E
25|$|The Briskeby Line {{consists}} of a concurrent section with the Skøyen Line from Jernbanetorget to it leaves Henrik Ibsens gate at Inkognitogata. This segment {{is known as the}} Southern String. West-bound trams run along Fred. Olsens gate and Prinsens gate before reaching Stortingsgata. East-bound trams run from Stortingsgata along Nedre Vollgate, Tollbugata and Strandgata to Jernbanetorget. Along these sections there are three stations: Dronningens gate (east-bound only), Kongens gate (west-bound only) and Wessels plass (east-bound only). There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> to Stortorvet through Kirkegata (west-bound) and Kongens gate (east-bound). The Vika Line deviates from the Briskeby Line through Akersgata.|$|E
