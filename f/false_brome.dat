50|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly on tussocks of grasses. In Scotland most eggs are laid on purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea). In England most foodplant records were on <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (Brachypodium sylvaticum) {{but it may}} have used Bromus spp. {{as it does in}} {{continental}} Europe. In the USA, purple reedgrass (Calamagrostis purpurascens) is a noted foodplant. They are laid in June or July and take about 10 days to hatch. On hatching the larvae make shelters from rolled grass blades tied with silk from where they emerge at night to feed. In the autumn they construct a hibernaculum by drawing together several blades and the fully grown larvae spend the winter here. Before hibernation they are a pale green, after hibernation they are a pale beige. Upon waking the following spring they make no attempt to feed and will rest on a blade of grass for up to a week before pupating. The pupae are a pale buff colour with dark lines running along the length and are well camouflaged. About five or six weeks later the adult emerges and can be seen on the wing between May and July depending on the latitude (later further north). A very active butterfly, it needs a lot of nectar and sunshine. However, they are less strictly diurnal than other skippers. Although preferentially flying from the late morning to dusk, they may be found before dawn and some time after dusk too (Fullard & Napoleone 2001).|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are <b>False</b> <b>Brome,</b> Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that this Eurasian grass was accidentally introduced into two areas in Oregon and one site in California by examining nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast haplotype variation in 23 introduced and 25 native populations. In the invaded range, there was significantly lower allelic richness (RS), observed heterozygosity (HO) and within-population gene diversity (HS), although a formal test failed to detect a significant genetic bottleneck.

40|$|Purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> grass (Brachypodium distachyon) has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} model system for temperate grasses and is also a potential model plant to investigate plant interactions with economically important pathogens such as rust fungi. We determined the host status of five Brachypodium species to three isolates of Puccinia brachypodii, the prevalent rust species on Brachypodium sylvaticum in nature, and to one isolate each of three formae speciales of the stripe rust fungus P striiformis. Two P. striiformis isolates produced sporulating lesions, both in {{only one of the}} tested interactions, suggesting a marginal host status of B. distachyon. P brachypodii formed sporulating uredinia on the five Brachypodium species tested, and a range of reactions was observed. Surprisingly, the B. sylvaticum-derived rust isolates were more frequently pathogenic to B. distachyon than to their original host species. The B. distachyon diploid inbred lines, developed and distributed as reference material to the Brachypodium research community, include susceptible and resistant genotypes to at least three of the four P brachypodii isolates tested. This creates the opportunity to use B. distachyon/P. brachypodii as a model pathosystem. In one B. distachyon accession, heavy infection by the loose smut fungus Ustilogo bromivora occurred.

40|$|Most {{herbaceous}} plants live in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. AM fungi colonize {{the roots}} of their host plant symbionts and provide them with mineral nutrients, especially phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and receive, in exchange, photosynthetically fixed carbon. In this work, we focused {{on the role of}} N in the AM symbiosis formed between Glomus mosseae or Rhizophagus irregularis and different plants belonging to the Poaceae: sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), foxtail millet (Setaria italic) and purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (Brachypodium distachyon). It had been shown that AM fungi can take up N in form of nitrate, ammonium and amino acid and transfer it to the plant in form of ammonium. Thus, we hypothesized that some plant ammonium transporters (AMT) might be up-regulated at the interface between plant and fungus in the AM symbiosis. As described in chapter 2, we established mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized sorghum plants and gave them different N treatments: no nitrogen, nitrate or ammonium. We found out that two AMTs, AMT 3; 1 and AMT 4 were induced in mycorrhized plants (AM-inducible AMTs) independently of their N status. In sorghum, the pattern of expression of AMT 3; 1 and AMT 4 was assessed with a split-root experiment combined with laser microdissection technology. Expression of both AMTs was not systemic in {{the roots of}} the plant. However, at a small scale, systemic expression around cells containing arbuscules could be observed. We conclude that expression of AMT 3; 1 and AMT 4 could be part of the prepenetration response of the plant, preparing the cells to receive a new arbuscule. In addition, using immunolocalization, we localized the protein of AMT 3; 1 at the level of mature arbuscules. As described in chapter 3, the up-regulation of AMT 3; 1 and AMT 4 was conserved in all four Poaceae species studies. As the core Poaceae divided in two groups about - 55 million years ago separating sorghum, foxtail millet and maize from rice and purple <b>false</b> <b>brome,</b> we assume that AMT 3; 1 and AMT 4 were already induced by AM fungi in a common ancestor of all these plants. In chapter 4, we looked at the fungal side and at the effect of the different N treatments on the expression of fungal transporters and enzymes of the N cycle. Our results show that the source of N has an impact on the transcriptional regulation of enzymes from the fungal N cycle. Expression of the corresponding genes was modified in the fungal extraradical mycelium {{as well as in the}} intraradical mycelium. In chapter 5, we studied the time needed by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae to transfer N from a 15 N-labeled source to sorghum plants. Labeled N was present in the plant leaves already after 48 hours revealing a very rapid transfer. This finding highlights the underestimated role of AM symbiosis in N-acquisition by the plant. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 In {{terms of}} {{production}} forestry, {{more often than}} not any species that is not the crop species is considered a competitor as they are using finite growing resources that would otherwise be available to the crop species. With specific regard to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) production in the Pacific Northwest, this study evaluated an array of morphological and physiological plant attributes to discern the relative competitive abilities of several common forest species and planted Douglas-fir in western Oregon {{during the first year of}} plantation establishment in the presence and absence of vegetation management treatments. The competitive ability of a species refers to the morphological and physiological characteristics associated with resource acquisition and internal allocation; a concept lacking a specific metric for evaluation. A conceptual model of plant resource utilization including proxy metrics for key aboveground plant-environment interactions was used a framework for synthetic assessment of species relative competitive ability. The relative competitive abilities of species were evaluated over a summer growing season with assessments of saturated specific leaf area (SLA[subscript SAT]) and saturated leaf dry matter content (LDMC[subscript SAT]), diurnal and seasonal leaf-level gas exchange (net photosynthesis (P[subscript n]), stomatal conductance (G[subscript s]), and derived instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUE)), midday leaf xylem pressure potential (Ψ[subscript md]), aboveground proportional allocation of biomass into stem, leaf, and reproductive body components, leaf area index (LAI), and morphological development and growth (height, crown radius, and diameter and bud density for Douglas-fir). The study employed a complete randomized block design (RCBD) with four replicates (blocks) and three vegetation management treatment regimes: untreated control (C), site preparation only (SP), and site preparation with a spring and summer release (SP+R). The relative competitive ability of all species was evaluated in the C, whereas only dominant competitor species remained for evaluation in the SP treatment. Vegetation treatment effects were evaluated among remaining competitor species and Douglas-fir in the C and SP treatments, whereas the response of Douglas-fir was assessed across all three vegetation management treatments (C, SP, SP+R). Selected forest competitor species included two woody perennial shrubs, two ferns, one herbaceous dicot, and two herbaceous graminoid species: trailing blackberry (Rubus ursinus Cham. & Schlecht), snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus (L.) Blake), swordfern (Polystichum munitum (Kaulfuss) K. Presl), bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn), woodland groundsel (Senecio sylvaticus L.), California brome (Bromus carinatus Hook. & Arn.), and <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv). Forest competitor species evaluated in the SP treatment were limited to trailing blackberry, swordfern, woodland groundsel, and California brome. Species relative competitive ability varied dramatically. However, similarities related to herbaceous and woody life forms were observed. Based on both univariate and multivariate response variable analyses, the relative competitive abilities of species examined in the study were ranked as follows: woodland groundsel > <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> > California brome > trailing blackberry = bracken fern > snowberry > swordfern > Douglas-fir.

In this study, two specific motifs were found besides the common alpha-amylase inhibitors (AAI) domain from the allergenic Tryp_alpha_amyl family members in rice seeds (trRSAs). To understand the evolution and functional importance of the Tryp_alpha_amy 1 family and the specific motifs for the allergenic one, a BLAST search identified 75 homologous proteins of trRSAs (trHAs) from 22 plant species including main crops such as rice, maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) from all available sequences in the public databases. Statistical analysis showed that the allergenicity of trHAs is closely associated with these two motifs with high number of cysteine residues (p value = 0. 00026), and the trHAs with and without the two motifs were clustered into separate clades, respectively. Furthermore, significant difference was observed on the secondary and tertiary structures of allergenic and nonallergenic trHAs. In addition, expression analysis showed that trHA-encoding genes of purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> (Brachypodium distachyon), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula), rice, and sorghum are dominantly expressed in seeds.

40|$|Abstract Background Sucrose {{phosphate}} synthase (SPS) is {{an important}} component of the plant sucrose biosynthesis pathway. In the monocotyledonous Poaceae, five SPS genes have been identified. Here we present a detailed analysis of the wheat SPSII family in wheat. A set of homoeologue-specific primers was developed in order to permit both the detection of sequence variation, and the dissection of the individual contribution of each homoeologue to the global expression of SPSII. Results The expression in bread wheat over the course of development of various sucrose biosynthesis genes monitored on an Affymetrix array showed that the SPS genes were regulated over time and space. SPSII homoeologue-specific assays were used to show that the three homoeologues contributed differentially to the global expression of SPSII. Genetic mapping placed the set of homoeoloci on the short arms of the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. A resequencing of the A and B genome copies allowed the detection of four haplotypes at each locus. The 3 B copy includes an unspliced intron. A comparison of the sequences of the wheat SPSII orthologues present in the diploid progenitors einkorn, goatgrass and Triticum speltoides, as well as in the more distantly related species barley, rice, sorghum and purple <b>false</b> <b>brome</b> demonstrated that intronic sequence was less well conserved than exonic. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of SPSII gene showed that false purple brome was more similar to Triticeae than to rice. Wheat - rice synteny was found to be perturbed at the SPS region. Conclusion The homoeologue-specific assays will be suitable to derive associations between SPS functionality and key phenotypic traits. The amplicon sequences derived from the homoeologue-specific primers are informative regarding the evolution of SPSII in a polyploid context. </p...|$|E
40|$|Annual Mediterranean {{species of}} the genus Brachypodium are {{promising}} model plants for energy crops since their selfing nature and short-life cycles are an advantage in breeding programs. The <b>false</b> <b>brome,</b> B. distachyon, has already been sequenced and new genomic initiatives have triggered the de-novo genome sequencing of its close relatives such as B. stacei, a species that was until recently mistaken for B. distachyon. However, {{the success of these}} initiatives hinges on detailed knowledge about the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations for the effective use of germplasm in a breeding program. Understanding population genetic diversity and genetic structure is also an important prerequisite for designing effective experimental populations for genomic wide studies. However, population genetic data are still limited in B. stacei. We therefore selected and amplified 10 nuclear microsatellite markers to depict patterns of population structure and genetic variation among 181 individuals from 19 populations of B. stacei occurring in its predominant range, the western Mediterranean area: mainland Iberian Peninsula, continental Balearic Islands and oceanic Canary Islands. Our genetic results support the occurrence of a predominant selfing system with extremely high levels of homozygosity across the analyzed populations. Despite the low level of genetic variation found, two different genetic clusters were retrieved, one clustering all SE Iberian mainland populations and the island of Minorca and another one grouping all S Iberian mainland populations, the Canary Islands and all Majorcan populations except one that clustered with the former group. These results, together with a high sharing of alleles (89 %) suggest different colonization routes from the mainland Iberian Peninsula into the islands. A recent colonization scenario could explain the relatively low levels of genetic diversity and low number of alleles found in the Canary Islands populations while older colonization events are hypothesized to explain the high genetic diversity values found in the Majorcan populations. Our study provides widely applicable information about geographical patterns of genetic variation in B. stacei. Among others, the genetic pattern and the existence of local alleles will need to be adequately reflected in the germplasm collection of B. stacei for efficient genome wide association studies...|$|E
