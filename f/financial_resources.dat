40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the role of {{networks}} in both identifying and accessing <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers by technology-based ventures. We explore the role of networks by taking into account several specifications. We (1) acknowledge that new ventures can access <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers both directly and through referral, (2) make an analytical distinction between the identification of financial opportunities and the access to <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers, and (3) study the contingencies that influence the effectiveness of certain network positions and relationships in the new venture financing process. In order to explore the role of networks in financing, we conducted case studies in four technology-based ventures. Our findings show that for identifying <b>financial</b> opportunities and <b>resource</b> providers, a positional network that is rich in structural holes is favourable for new ventures. In a relational sense, for new ventures that directly access <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers, having weak network ties are most effective. When new ventures use a referral to access a <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> provider, referrals from referral sources that are strongly tied to the venture are the most effective. Furthermore, our results show that the effectiveness of certain network positions and relations largely depends on contingencies. Based on our findings, we shape several propositions that provide new directions for future research. The current study makes several contributions to theory and provides several interesting guidelines for start-up entrepreneurs...|$|R

Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements.

Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and <b>financial</b> <b>resources,</b> and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of {{networks}} in financing high technology start-ups. We claim that the role of networks is twofold. On the one hand networks are important because network contacts can give direct access to resources. On the other hand, networks are important because being affiliated with prominent partners can send important information signals to <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers. In this paper we focus in particular on a special type of signal, being the referral. The dual role of networks is studied in four high technology start-ups using a social systems approach. Our results show that start-ups in early development stages that have little experience and knowledge more often use referrals in accessing <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers. They seem to profit from a network rich in structural holes and many strong connections in getting financed. Added to these findings, we found that strong ties are more often activated as a referral source than weak ties. On the other hand, the more experienced entrepreneurs/start-ups in latter development stages access <b>financial</b> <b>resource</b> providers more direct without using referrals. They seem to profit from a network rich in structural holes combined with many weak ties...|$|R
