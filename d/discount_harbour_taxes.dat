50|$|Bottom of the <b>harbour</b> <b>tax</b> {{avoidance}} {{was a form}} of {{tax avoidance}} used in Australia in the 1970s. Legislation (below) made it a criminal offence in 1980. The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times.|$|R
50|$|The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 went further, {{allowing}} for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the <b>harbour</b> <b>tax</b> schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980. The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime.|$|R
50|$|Retroactive laws {{designed}} to prosecute what was perceived {{to have been}} a blatantly unethical means of tax avoidance were passed in the early 1980s by the Fraser government (see Bottom of the <b>harbour</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance). Similarly, the retroactive effect of legislation criminalizing certain war crimes retroactively have been held to be constitutional (see Polyukhovich v Commonwealth).|$|R
50|$|Two {{years later}} (1204), under the {{leadership}} of the Croatian nobleman Domald from Šibenik, most of the refugees returned and liberated the city from what remained of the crusader force. In 1204 Domald was comes (duke) of Zadar, but the following year (1205) Venetian authority was re-established and a peace agreement signed with hard conditions for the citizens. The only profit which the Communal Council of Zadar derived from this was one third of the city's <b>harbour</b> <b>taxes,</b> probably insufficient even for the most indispensable communal needs.|$|R
50|$|Founded on 8 March 1984 {{to prosecute}} alleged {{offences}} against Commonwealth criminal law, primarily the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), the CDPP was first headed by Director Ian Temby, {{who remained in}} that post until 1988. The CDPP commenced with a head office in Canberra, and a Melbourne office was opened on 6 June 1984, assuming responsibility {{for the work of}} Special Prosecutor Robert Redlich. The CDPP took over the work of the Special Prosecutors to prosecute bottom of the <b>harbour</b> <b>tax</b> cases and parts of the Attorney-General's Departments Deputy Crown Solicitor's Offices.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000. International {{competitiveness}} is {{a requirement}} for a country to attain high economic growth rates. It is also a precondition {{to benefit from the}} globalisation of the world economy. Improving competitiveness can raise a country's exports, which are frequently seen as a "growth engine" for an economy. South Africa is currently facing increasing global competition because of the trade Iiberalisations. The success of domestic firms depends on whether they can increase their international competitiveness. In this study, the role of transport costs and logistics in South Africa's competitiveness is investigated. It was established that transport infrastructure and the cost of transport plays {{a significant role in the}} cost of trade, as a result of different geographical locations of places and countries. In the case of South Africa, where high transport costs are assumed to lead to higher input prices and decreased competitiveness, national as well as international transport costs are investigated. The findings resulted in the conclusion that although insufficient transport infrastructure and insufficient maintenance of existing transport infrastructure are the cause of higher national transport costs and thus higher production costs, they are not the most significant contributors to the uncompetitiveness of South African export products. High <b>harbour</b> <b>taxes</b> (unique to South Africa), in addition to terminal handling costs as well as insufficient handling of goods at harbours, was identified to be the main obstacles from a transport and logistical perspective to South African exports. Irrespective of the transport cost problem, it was also found that insufficient logistical management plays a significant negative part in the competitiveness of South African products. The South African logistical 'management system, of which the management and handling of transport forms a part, compares very unfavourable to other countries. This indicated the infant stage in which the,South African logistical system is at the moment. An accelerated improvement of the logistical systems of companies is essential for the improvement of their products' competitiveness in international markets. Master...|$|R
40|$|The US incurs {{significant}} {{costs in}} order to maintain its ports and harbours. The <b>harbour</b> maintenance <b>tax,</b> introduced in 1986 under the Reagan-era overall initiative to cut back the average tax burden, has been controversial since its inception. Its imposition on US exports was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. A proposal by the Clinton administration to introduce a harbour services user fee did not gain the support of stakeholders and thus the earlier status quo continues today with the nation's trading partners protesting vehemently. The paper analyses recent US Army Corps of Engineers data on harbour maintenance expenses in the Port of New York and New Jersey and proposes a simple yet realistic user fee model, radically different from any previous proposal, that would comply with the US Supreme Court's constitutionality test while imposing a relatively minor burden on port users. In addition, using the US as an example, the paper contributes to the general discussion on infrastructure pricing and cost recovery through user charges and in this way it addresses, albeit on the fringe, broader public policy issues such as those of mandated taxes and private versus public interest.

40|$|Tax administrations {{worldwide}} provide taxpayers with favour {{and offer}} {{them the opportunity}} to set up transfer pricing system according to pre-agreed criteria. When taxpayer´s system complies with, a tax administrator does not dispute the transaction. Any predefined arrangement leading to the recognition of transfer pricing system by the tax administrator can be defined as a safe harbour. It was found out during the review process of current sources, that there is no relevant research available focused on assessing the appropriateness of introducing safe harbour system for both businesses and government. At the same time, even the OECD does not work with data that would conclusively prove the impact of transfer pricing regulation on companies´ behaviour. For this reason, a research was conducted in this area with focus on the potential of safe <b>harbour</b> to affect <b>tax</b> contributions of enterprises. Financial data were rendered from Amadeus database. The impact of safe harbour system was observed on the time series development of taxation of particular cluster. Cluster analysis was selected as the most suitable method for grouping companies...|$|R
50|$|From 22 February 1875 to 25 September 1878 Boucaut {{represented}} Encounter Bay, and on 3 June 1875 Boucaut formed {{his second}} ministry, {{in which he}} was commissioner of crown lands and immigration. An education bill was successfully taken through the assembly, and in September Boucaut brought in a bill authorizing the raising of a loan of £3,000,000 for the construction or extension of 13 lines of railway and various other public works. But opposition in the council, and the fear of increased taxation, temporarily held up railway extensions. The cabinet was reconstructed in March 1876, but resigned early in the following June. The ministry of John Colton, which followed, adopted part of Boucaut's railway extension policy and succeeded in carrying it through. Boucaut formed his third ministry in October 1877 and became Treasurer of South Australia. During the following nine months some useful legislation was passed, including a crown lands consolidation bill, and provision for several railway lines and for the improvement of Victor <b>Harbour.</b> An income <b>tax</b> bill was defeated, but a property tax of threepence in the pound was agreed to. In September 1878, on the death of Justice Stow, Boucaut was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia.|$|R
