40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of subsea developments in the oil and gas industry, {{there is a need for}} more, and reliable, information on how to conduct safe and well informed subsea operations. One of the hot topics today is displacement of hydrocarbons during shut-in situations and interventions. This is done by injecting a <b>displacement</b> <b>liquid,</b> typically MEG or methanol, to lower the content of hydrocarbons in the domain, aiming to prevent formation of hydrates or release of chemicals that pose a risk to the environment. This report presents results obtained from experimental work and numerical simulations conducted on a U-shaped subsea jumper like pipe setup, performed to analyze how the shape of the displacement front, flow pattern and phase hold up evolves with varying displacement velocity. To examine the accuracy of the numerical model and provide more details about the multiphase flow dynamics, experimental and simulated results were compared. A pipe geometry was designed and constructed to mimic a U-shaped subsea jumper, using 153. 6 mm inner diameter (ID) transparent PVC pipes. Displacement was done through two different inlets, located at the bottom left and top of the U. When displacing trough the bottom inlet, parts of the closest vertical section were blocked to mimic a dead-leg. In total eight experiments were conducted through each inlet, with water-oil displacement and oil-water displacement with four different velocities. Liquid hold-up was measured after displacing one, two and tree jumper volumes. A high-speed camera was used to capture the flow for further analysis. The experimental cases were recreated and simulated using ANSYS CFX, a computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) tool, to check the accuracy of the solver and models used. Two different multiphase models were tested, inhomogeneous mixture model and homogenous standard free-surface model. Shear Stress Transport model was used to model turbulence for both models. Results are reported numerically and visually before being compare to experimental results. Experimental results show that the displacement efficiency is dependent on the establishment of a displacement front. A clear displacement front was only observed for rates higher than 20 m 3 /h with water-oil and oil-water displacement. Water-oil displacement had the highest displacement efficiency, although it was severely reduced after one displacement volume. Oil-water displacement shows a better displacement efficiency after one displacement volume, but has a lower sweep efficiency due to a reduced front height. Overall the numerical simulations results has problems predicting displacement with low velocities, for oil-water and water-oil displacement. The inhomogeneous mixture model has a better prediction of hold-up for oil-water displacement when there is mixing of the liquids. The homogenous free-surface model predicts best for water-oil displacement, when there are clear interfaces between the liquids...|$|E

40|$|The {{contact angle}} of water was {{measured}} with the Wilhelmy plate method on apolar polymers: soft ethylene-propylene copolymer (EP), rigid polypropylene (PP), and their blends PP/EP (80 wt % PP) and EP/PP (20 wt % PP). Upon <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement,</b> the contact angles of the soft materials, EP and EP/PP, depended on viscoelastic energy dissipation due to solid deformation. This was observed in different situations: wetting and dewetting, <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> due to the relative motion of the plain liquid {{with respect to the}} solid, and meniscus relaxation when that motion was stopped. The wetting hysteresis of polymer blends may be understood by considering viscoelastic energy dissipation and the static contact angles.

Reversible switching from transparency to coloration offers additional functionality. Based on Bruggeman's effective medium theory, we derive a transparency master equation, which is valid for bilayers of arbitrary host materials and pore-filling compounds. The transparency condition fixes pore volume fractions such that the effective refractive index is homogenized through the bilayer, hence, through arbitrary layered optical media built from this bilayer.

40|$|Wheat kernel {{breakage}} is {{a critical}} factor in the flour milling process, and is affected by kernel density. Kernel density measurement is not routinely performed, and depends on the measurement technique used and the moisture content of the grains. This study compared currently available wet and dry methods based on gas <b>displacement</b> and <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> (using water, water-ethanol mixtures and xylene) to determine the density of Hereward (hard) and Consort (soft) wheat kernels of different sizes and moisture contents. A gas pycnometer was used to measure the average density of a sample of wheat kernels, while a double cup system was used to measure individual kernel density by weighing kernels in air and immersed in liquid. The hard wheat variety, Hereward, had kernels of slightly higher average density, with a narrower distribution, than the soft variety, Consort. Kernel density was independent of kernel size, while increasing moisture content decreased the measured kernel density.

40|$|The <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> {{method is}} a {{commonly}} used method {{to determine the}} pore size distribution of micro- and ultrafiltration membranes. One of the assumptions for the calculation of the pore sizes is that the pores are parallel and thus are not interconnected. To show that the estimated pore size distribution is affected if this assumption is not satisfied, we developed two models: (1) a model describing the flow through an isotropic porous membrane with uniform pores, and (2) a two-layer model for uniform pores that approximates the first model if the membrane thickness is larger than 10 times the pore radius. In the two-layer model the membrane skin layer {{is divided into two}} parts: the unconnected pore layer and a sublayer. This model is extended to describe pore activation as a function of pressure with a pore size distribution in the unconnected pore layer (that is, membrane surface). It is shown that, depending on the membrane thickness or the sublayer resistance, the transmembrane pressure needs to be much larger than the critical pressure of the pores, to activate all the pores. If the sublayer resistance is over 10 % of the resistance of the unconnected pore layer, the pore size is underestimated with the <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> method; thus the number of pores is overestimated. Because the sublayer resistance is always larger than the unconnected pore layer resistance in an isotropic membrane with interconnected pores, we conclude that the estimated pore size distribution is always shifted toward smaller pore sizes than they really are. To use the <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> method correctly, we suggest either counting the number of (active) pores or measuring the flux-pressure curve several times, while covering each time a different fraction of the membrane surface...|$|R

For <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> gasometers where a barrier solution separates the biogas and the atmosphere, inaccuracy due to gas diffusion was examined experimentally. Acidified saturated saline solution was the most suitable barrier solution, as biogas characteristics changed least with time. Using acidified or tap water caused considerable biogas losses and should therefore be avoided where biogas is stored before measurement. Errors associated with volume calculation from three common <b>liquid</b> <b>displacement</b> gasometer types were investigated theoretically. Corrections that {{must be made to}} obtain gas volumes at standard temperature and pressure when using this equipment are discussed. Regarding experimental errors, gasometer designs where displaced liquid is weighed to determine the volume are the most versatile since errors depend mainly upon balance sensitivity. Using liquid heights to calculate volume requires appropriate sizing of the gasometer relative to the volume of gas measured. The calibration of a low flow gas meter was investigated and an approximately linear variation with flow rate was found; hence in situ calibration is advised for this type of instrument.
