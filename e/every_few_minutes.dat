The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Stromboli, which has been erupting continuously for centuries. Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of gas bubbles within the magma. These gas bubbles within the magma accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles, called gas slugs. These grow large enough to rise through the lava column. Upon reaching the surface, the difference in air pressure causes the bubble to burst with a loud pop, throwing magma {{in the air in}} a way similar to a soap bubble. Because of the high gas pressures associated with the lavas, continued activity is generally in the form of episodic explosive eruptions accompanied by the distinctive loud blasts. During eruptions, these blasts occur as often as <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> on each side, {{but most}} of the boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief description}} of two powerful radar-based remote sensing techniques to monitor the deformations of roads, their associated infrastructures and, more in general, their surroundings. The first technique is the satellite radar interferometric technique. In this work a specific technique, named Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), is considered. This technique has wide-area coverage capability (e. g. covering thousands of square kilometres at the time) and,at the same time, is sensitive to very subtle displacements. The second technique, named groundbased radar interferometry is based on a terrestrial instrument. From the viewpoint of the deformation measurement principle this second technique is very similar to the first one. However, {{it can be used to}} cover much smaller areas but offering a very dense temporal sampling capability (e. g. one measurement <b>every</b> a <b>few</b> <b>minutes).</b> This is typically used to monitor critical deformation phenomena, e. g. very active landslides that may represent a high risk for a given road, etc. This work provides, for both techniques, a concise description with several references to major works related to them. In addition, it illustrates some examples of the results that can be achieved with both techniques...|$|R

40|$|Most {{research}} on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) assumes ephemeral, lightly loaded deployments. Each node has {{a lifetime of}} a few hours and initiates a lookup once <b>every</b> <b>few</b> seconds or <b>minutes.</b> However, in giant internet data centers, each node has a lifetime of weeks or months and initiates {{hundreds or thousands of}} lookups every second. In such an environment, one-hop DHTs are superior to multi-hop DHTs. They use lookup bandwidth more efficiently. We qualify conflicting research to show that a single onehop DHT can indeed scale to at least a few hundred thousand nodes in stable, high-capacity enterprise networks. Two new designs are presented: One Hop Sites (1 HS), a high-capacity DHT tailored for site redundancy; and the One Hop Federation (1 HF), a global, hierarchic DHT that resolves an open latency problem. For both, the analysis a) confirms linear scalability to at least a few hundred thousand nodes and b) identifies the most sensitive design parameters...|$|R

Rather than single pieces, {{which would require}} the audience to applaud <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Morricone thought the best idea {{was to create a}} series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favorites. In concert, Morricone normally has 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and ethnic instruments share the stage.|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{considerable}} efforts devoted {{to the development of}} WSN for SHM systems [1 - 6]. Most of the sensing systems are built with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless sensor nodes, such as Mica-Z Mote [3, 4], Mica- 2 Mote [5], and iMote [6], etc. Even though these modules are designed with low-power consumption as one of the design objectives, their structures still follow a conventional sensing framework, which includes sensing, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), digital signal processing (DSP), and wireless transmission. These modules are designed separately, and they do not directly take advantage of the unique features of SHM systems. In order to achieve ULP performance, we need to break free from the conventional sensing frameworks and seek fundamentally new WSN structures. SHM possesses many unique features that can be exploited to facilitate the ULP design. Many of the structures, such as bridges, have a very slow changing rate, e.g., new data might only need to be collected once <b>every</b> <b>few</b> seconds or <b>minutes.</b> As a result, SHM has long latency tolerance with ultra-low data rate. In addition, Data collected by spatially distributed sensors often contain redundancy [7, 8], which can be used to achieve better power efficiency.|$|R

25|$|The {{hands and}} facial {{features}} of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up on a rack <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to rest while still inside the costumes.

25|$|Due to glycated hemoglobin's {{variability}} (as {{shown in}} the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing {{to determine whether the}} HbA1c values are due to averaging out high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) with low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous blood glucose monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not by Medicare in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least weekly. Another test that is useful in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is 1,5 Anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences hyperglycemia above 180mg/dL over a two-week period.|$|E
