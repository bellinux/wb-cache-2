50|$|Abad forms {{part of a}} new {{generation}} of authors that emerges in Colombia beyond magical realism.

The richness, plot, irony, permanent <b>enticement</b> <b>of</b> the reader, the intensity of his stories, as well as the seriousness of the social, historical, and human research behind his confessional narrative, stand Abad as a brilliant recreator of the contemporary Colombian society through literature.|$|R

On the other side, independent publishers of the early 1980s like Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics were strong promoters of creator-owned properties; their <b>enticement</b> <b>of</b> popular creators (such as Kirby) to their pages helped push the issue to the fore and put pressure on industry giants Marvel and DC.
