5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown.

25|$|Phil is told by Ian that Ben {{has died}} after a {{homophobic}} attack following a night out, however this {{turns out to}} be Paul, Ben's boyfriend. Ben struggles to grieve for Paul's death and asks Phil for a gun to take revenge, but he refuses and Ben disappears. When Grant returns to Walford again, he accuses Phil of killing Peggy and still orders him to return all of the money Phil owes to him. After going through Sharon's bag, Phil learns that Grant has a son, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous), with Sharon's best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully/Jenna Russell) following a one-night stand 21 years previously.

In gratitude for Grant rescuing Ben, Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Grant persuades Phil to attend Paul's funeral for Ben's sake, which he does. Phil lends Grant money to support him financially and Grant tells him to fight his liver condition. Later, Ben tells Phil that he will donate part of his liver.

500|$|Biographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, {{seeking to}} explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way. [...] In recent decades historians have {{typically}} portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. Barbara Tuchman, for example, portrays Hutchinson as an [...] "ill-fated" [...] and [...] "tragic figure." [...] British scholar David Kenneth Fieldhouse says his tragedy emerged because he was “a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic." [...] Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: [...] "Nothing would have pleased him [...] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King. His irritation with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places." [...] Bailyn <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist.
