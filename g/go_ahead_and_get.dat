2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

She survives and dumps Aiden, disgusted that he had left her for dead in the wreckage. Sarah reconciles with Todd and they move into the flat over the bookies, causing problems between Gail and Sarah, particularly when Sarah tells her that she is pregnant, aged 16. She is unsure about having the baby but Todd convinces her to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> they <b>get</b> engaged, despite their families' disapproval.

This was done; not, of course, in Grierson's name. The next move, before {{the formation of the}} Riverside Company, was to [...] "see" [...] Mr. Judd Jason. The success or failure of the enterprise was in his hands. Mahomet must go to the mountain, and I went to Monahan's saloon, first having made an appointment. It {{was not the first time}} I had been there since I had made that first memorable visit, but I never quite got over the feeling of a neophyte before Buddha, though I did not go so far as to analyze the reason,--that in Mr. Jason I was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy I had adopted, the logical consequence of enlightened self-interest. If he had ever heard of it, he would have made no pretence of being anything else. Greatness, declares some modern philosopher, has no connection with virtue; it is the continued, strong and logical expression of some instinct; in Mr. Jason's case, the predatory instinct. And like a true artist, he loved his career for itself--not for what its fruits could buy. He might have built a palace on the Heights with the tolls he took from the disreputable houses of the city; he was contented with Monahan's saloon: nor did he seek to propitiate a possible God by endowing churches and hospitals with a portion of his income. Try though I might, I never could achieve the perfection of this man's contempt for all other philosophies. The very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place of his from out of the bright, respectable region in which I lived was in itself an acknowledgment of this. I thought him a thief--a necessary thief--and he knew it: he was indifferent to it; and it amused him, I think, to see clinging to me, when I entered his presence, shreds of that morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for the sake of decency.|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In {{a thermal}} power plant, the boiler is a portion {{responsible}} of converting incoming water into steam which {{is followed by}} various apparatus which turn it to super heated steam. This steam is supplied to steam turbines. The dryer the incoming steam greater is {{the efficiency of the}} turbines and greater is the electricity produced. The general issue with the incoming water to the boiler is it is filled dissolved gases, very tiny particles and other stuff that damage the boiler and the adjoining apparatus. The presence of these cause damage to the boiler and other devices on the longer run and reduce their lifestyle. Even a single replacement of the boiler coupled with other apparatus can cause exaggerating expenditure. In general, the apparatus attached with a boiler are super heaters, steam turbines and condensate pump. The dissolved gases present in water can react with the walls of these, form oxides, and corrode them. With time, the walls of these devices develop cracks and hence loose their working capability. This project comes up with a pre set apparatus before water is let to the boiler. This set up cleans the water of all visible impurities so that they are not deposited at any point in the whole process. Next, it <b>goes</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> rid of most of the dissolved gases present that have chances of reacting with the boiler or other following apparatus following boiler. In this way, a sure and reliable set up can be installed to improve the lifetime of the apparatus used in the power plant. This will end up saving cost at a very high level. This project depicts and explains such a set up and uses SCADA to present its functioning. With the help of SCADA, this system becomes foolproof by installing artificial intelligence by the use of sensors and alarms. The alarms are set for critical and normal use values and it is also described in the project. The SCADA would be aimed at reading critical data like water analysis, system analysis, water flow, water levels etc. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{proposes a}} study of the {{communicative}} and organizing practices of a School Health Advisory Committee (SHAC) located in rural Appalachia. Using poststructural feminist and narrative theoretical sensibilities, I argue the SHAC illuminates the potentials and pitfalls of policy-mandated forms of organizing to address health disparities and their impact on lived experiences. Furthermore, the SHAC’s setting offers a unique opportunity to engage the symbolic and material elements of discourses surrounding poverty and social class in health communication.
