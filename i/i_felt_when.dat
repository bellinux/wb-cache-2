500|$|... "Cry Over Me" [...] is, {{according}} to Meat Loaf, a timeless song dealing with relationships of all kinds. In a 2007 interview, {{he says that}} it can be about your first or last loves, or dealing with your boss at work. Partially quoting the lyrics, the singer posits that there are times when [...] "you want him to feel exactly like <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> he said that to me." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency". He has also stated that, [...] "If your country needs you, you should be right there, that is the way <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I was young, and that's the way I feel today." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{explained}} that the song's theme was [...] "complete loneliness," [...] going on to state: [...] "It {{was important to me}} that that there'd be something searingly poetic about it, in a lyrical sense, and yet jubilant at the same time." [...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have." [...] Morrissey {{explained that}} the verse described [...] "how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I couldn't afford clothes and used to dress in rags but I didn't really feel mentally impoverished." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the poem, {{the narrator}} expresses his hope that his child, Hartley Coleridge, will {{experience}} a life connected to nature {{as represented by}} features typical of the Lake District, which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered. This is similar to what Coleridge's friend William Wordsworth does with the narrator of Tintern Abbey, a poem composed later that year. Many of {{the feelings of the}} narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge's sonnet [...] "To a Friend Who Asked, How <b>I</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>When</b> the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me". The ideas about nature in This Lime-Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education, and Hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. Coleridge's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Tippett {{recognised}} {{the importance}} to his compositional development of several 19th- and 20th-century composers: Berlioz for his clear melodic lines, Debussy for his inventive sound, Bartók for his colourful dissonance, Hindemith for his skills at counterpoint, and Sibelius for his originality in musical forms. [...] He revered Stravinsky, sharing the Russian composer's deep interest in older music. Tippett had heard early ragtime {{as a small}} child before the [...] First World War; he noted in his later writings that, {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, ragtime and jazz [...] "attracted many serious composers thinking to find... a means to refresh serious music by the primitive". His [...] interest in these forms led to his fascination with blues, articulated in several of his later works. Among his contemporary composers, Tippett admired Britten and shared his desire to end the perception of English music as provincial. He also had a high regard for Alan Bush, with whom he joined forces to produce the 1934 Pageant of Labour. [...] "I can remember the excitement <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> he outlined to me his plan for a major string quartet".|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{remained}} serious. [...] "It was a {{very fine}} point,--a very little thing to reject a man for. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first read her letter about it." ...|$|R

5000|$|To quote {{an excerpt}} from his book: [...] "Einstein once wrote of America that its people were “always becoming, never being,” {{but it was in}} India now that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that sense of newness, of {{perpetual}} reinvention and forward momentum that <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first moved to America".|$|R
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Appearing on The Pods & Sods Network in July 2017, Michael Beinhorn {{detailed}} {{the process of}} recording Soundgarden’s 1994 album Superunknown. And he shares his reaction to first hearing Black Hole Sun during that time, “I think {{for the rest of}} my entire life, until I draw my last breath, I’ll never ever forgot how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> they started playing that song. From the very first few notes, I felt like I’d been hit by a thunderbolt. I was just absolutely stunned. What in the world is this? I get goosebumps thinking about it now.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{picked him}} for the first Test, and on the very first {{occasion}} he touched a ball in Test rugby he found himself opposed one-on-one by Stu Wilson, then widely rated the number-one winger in the world, in the middle of Lancaster Park. Campese stood Wilson up and ran around him so easily that he might have been playing Test Rugby for years. He did it once or twice again before the match was over and on one occasion scored a try. I was enthused, and so was the media. They wrote of him in glowing terms next day... I don't believe I have ever lost the sense of wonder at his ability which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I saw him run around Stu Wilson on Lancaster Park." ...|$|E
60|$|I did as desired, Mary {{watching}} the process with interested and, {{at the same}} time, amused eyes. I thought she looked as sorry as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>when</b> that lank, villanous wig was again performing its office.|$|R

2500|$|The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment with {{attached}} infantry {{company and}} the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at Beirut on 8 October. The city was occupied without opposition when 600 prisoners were captured. The remainder of the infantry division and artillery followed when the road enabled the movement of wheeled vehicles. Private Norman F. Rothon, a mule driver with the 13th Mountain Howitzer Battery, 8th Brigade RGA, 7th (Meerut) Division, arrived at Beirut {{on the evening of}} 9 October. He and his unit had marched [...] since 19 September; [...] of that total were marched between 8 and 9 October. Rothon wrote in his diary, [...] "if I was asked how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> we arrived I should say like a cripple and fairly doubled up and I hope I shall never experience another march like it the men tramping along with hollow cheeks and staring eyes, nothing to eat but the awful Bouilli & Biscuits and lots of the men go without as their stomachs cannot stand the awful repetition (we have had 3 weeks of it). My inside yearns for some ordinary food & vegetables." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> I read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
