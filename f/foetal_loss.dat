40|$|Summary- Recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>loss</b> is a {{significant}} clinical problem, occurring in 1 - 5 % of reproductive females. Inherited or acquired thrombop-hilia has been diagnosed in 50 - 65 % of women with history of unexplained <b>foetal</b> <b>loss.</b> The low molecular weight heparin was applied in 24 wo-men with inherited thrombophilia and previous recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>loss</b> and in 6 women with primary antiphospholipid syndrome throughout their following pregnancies. The dose of low molecular weight heparin {{for the majority of}} women was 35 - 75 u/kg. Women with primary antiphosp-holipid syndrome received both low molecular weight heparin and aspirin 50 - 100 mg daily. Implementation of thromboprophylaxis resulted in successful pregnancy outcome in 29 out of 38 pregnancies, which represents {{a significant}} improvement of pregnancy outcome in comparison to previous 81 pregnancy losses. The number of treated pregnancies in our study is small, but the rate of successful pregnancy outcomes is high (76 %), indicating that low molecular weight heparin may be a promising approach to women with thrombophilia and recurrent <b>foetal</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E

There were 17 pregnancies in 16 women with SLE. Our patients have {{a mean age of}} 28. 31 years (SD 5. 24) and a mean disease duration of 38. 62 months (SD 38. 03). Our patients have complicated pregnancies: 35. 3 % have SLE flares, 21. 1 % have preeclampsia and 47. 4 % needed caesarean sections. There were 15. 8 % <b>foetal</b> <b>losses</b> and 12. 5 % preterm deliveries in our patients. All the <b>foetal</b> <b>losses</b> occurred in patients with severe SLE flares during pregnancies.

40|$|The antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disease characterised by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and <b>foetal</b> <b>losses</b> {{in combination with}} circulating anti-phospholipid antibodies {{in the blood of}} the afflicted patients. Over the last 25 years numerous studies have established the correlation between the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and thrombo-embolic manifestations but how these antibodies cause thrombosis is still unclear. Most scientists now accept the fact that only a subset of the antiphospholipid antibodies has clinical relevance. Not antibodies to anionic phospholipids but rather antibodies to beta 2 -glycoprotein I are thought to be the major cause for the pathological manifestations. beta 2 -Glycoprotein I is a plasma protein without a known function and persons lacking beta 2 -Glycoprotein I are completely healthy.

Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. Outcomes analyzed included live birth rate, pregnancy rate, fetal losses, and surgical complications. Results: An overall advantage of laparoscopic surgery was demonstrated when analyzing live birth rate [relative risk (RR) 1. 52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 26 - 1. 84, p < 0. 01].

This study {{was carried out in}} order to ascertain whether any maternal or perinatal relevant factors influenced M/F in Malta. Methods: National Obstetric Information System data was used for the period 2012 - 2015. Non-Maltese mothers were excluded. Factors analysed were maternal age, marital status, education, body mass index, regularity of menses, utilisation of assisted reproductive technology, previous diabetes mellitus, previous miscarriages, abortions, ectopic pregnancies, vaginal deliveries, caesarean sections, livebirths, early and late neonatal deaths, stillbirths and premature deliveries. Intra-partum conditions included infection, cardiovascular disorders and all forms of diabetes mellitus. Results: This study analysed 14498 births. None of the above mentioned variables was significantly linked to the M/F ratio. Discussion: Our dataset failed to find any variables that influenced M/F, including stressing variables. However our study may have been underpowered due to the small numbers of births and the relative rarity of the various conditions. Alternatively, in Malta, such variables may produce little or no stress due to hitherto unknown mitigating factor/s. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveEndometriosis is the {{presence}} of an endometrial gland or stroma in sites other than the uterine cavity and it is frequently diagnosed in infertile women. It has not been well established whether laparoscopic surgery improves fertility. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery for subfertility related to endometriosis. Materials and methodsMain electronic databases were searched for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials. Trials were included if they were randomized or nonrandomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of subfertility associated with endometriosis versus other treatment methods or diagnostic laparoscopy only. Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. Outcomes analyzed included live birth rate, pregnancy rate, fetal losses, and surgical complications. ResultsAn overall advantage of laparoscopic surgery was demonstrated when analyzing live birth rate [relative risk (RR) 1. 52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 26 – 1. 84, p <  0. 01]. An increase in pregnancy rate after laparoscopic surgery was seen (RR of 1. 44, 95 % CI 1. 24 – 1. 68, p <  0. 01). No significant difference in <b>foetal</b> <b>losses.</b> ConclusionThe use of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of subfertility related to minimal endometriosis may increase the chances of future pregnancy and live birth...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that the transfers of bovine and ovine embryos produced by in vitro procedures (IVP) or by nuclear transfer (NT) {{have resulted in the}} birth of heavy offspring. The present paper presents summary information from 30 data sets obtained worldwide (WW) on IVP and NT in different cattle breeds, plus the preliminary results from a highly controlled field study (FS) undertaken by Holland Genetics (HG) on Holstein-Friesian IVP calves. Data of artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET) served as controls. The results from the WW and FS trials were very similar. After adjusting for such effects as season, parity of cow/recipient and sex of calf, <b>foetal</b> <b>losses</b> between pregnancy diagnosis and term were higher for IVP and NT embryos. In addition, both gestation length and birth weight were increased relative to AI and ET calves, and there were also higher incidences of Dystocia, perinatal loss and anomalies. The increased incidence of these problems has important implications for animal health and welfare, as well as affecting the commercial acceptance of these techniques. Research should focus on each step in IVP and NT procedures and on the synchrony between embryo and uterus at transfer, to understand and overcome these problems...|$|R
