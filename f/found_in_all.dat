Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.|$|E

Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> the oceans.|$|E
