40|$|Often in actuarial practice, {{mortality}} projections {{are obtained}} by letting age-specific death rates decline exponentially {{at their own}} rate. Many life tables used for annuity pricing are built in this way. The present paper adopts {{this point of view}} and proposes a simple and powerful mortality projection model in line with this elementary approach, based on the recently studied mortality improvement rates. Two main applications are considered. First, as most reference life tables produced by regulators are deterministic by nature, they can be made stochastic by superposing random departures from the assumed age-specific trend, with a volatility calibrated on market or portfolio data. This allows the actuary to account for the systematic longevity risk in <b>solvency</b> <b>calculations.</b> Second, the model can be fitted to historical data and used to produce longevity forecasts. A number of conservative and tractable approximations are derived to provide the actuary with reasonably accurate ap- proximations for various relevant quantities, available at limited computational cost. Besides applications to stochastic mortality projection models, we also derive useful properties in- volving supermodular, directionally convex and stop-loss orders...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{conglomeration}} {{leads to}} a diversification of risks (the diversification benefit) and to a decrease in shareholder value (the conglomerate discount). Diversification ben-efits in financial conglomerates are typically derived without accounting for reduced shareholder value, even though a comprehensive analysis requires competitive condi-tions within the conglomerate, i. e., shareholders and debtholders receive risk-adequate returns. In this paper, we extend the literature by comparing the diversification effect in conglomerates with and without accounting for the altered shareholder value. We com-pare results for a holding company, a parent-subsidiary structure, and an integrated model. In addition, we consider different types of capital and risk transfer instruments in the parent-subsidiary model, including intra-group retrocession and guarantees. We conclude that diversification does not matter to the extent frequently emphasized in the literature when diversification effects are studied under competitive conditions.

40|$|When an {{investor}} is allocating assets between equities, bonds and property, this allocation needs {{to provide a}} portfolio with an appropriate risk/return trade-off: for instance, a pension scheme may prefer a robust portfolio that holds its aggregate value {{in a number of}} different situations. In order to do this, some estimate needs to be made of the volatility or uncertainty in the property assets, in order to use that in the same way as the volatilities of equities and bonds are used in the allocation. However, property assets are only valued monthly or quarterly (and are sold only rarely) whereas equities and bonds are priced continuously and recorded daily. Currently many actuaries may assume that the volatility of property assets is between those of equities and bonds, but without quantifying it from real data. The challenge for the Study Group is to produce a model for estimating the volatility or uncertainty in property asset values, for use in portfolio planning. The Study Group examined contexts for the use of volatility estimates, particularly in relation to <b>solvency</b> <b>calculations</b> as required by the Financial Services Authority, fund trustees and corporate boards, and it proposed a number of possible approaches.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment is a critical issue raised by Pillar II of Solvency II framework. In particular the Overall <b>Solvency</b> Needs <b>calculation</b> left the Insurance companies to define an optimal entity-specific solvency constraint on a multi-year time horizon. In a life insurance society framework, the intuitive approaches to answer this problem can sometimes lead to new implementation issues linked to the highly stochastic nature of the methodologies used to project a company Net Asset Value over several years. One alternative approach can be the use of polynomial proxies to replicate the outcomes of this variable throughout the time horizon. Polynomial functions are already considered as efficient replication methodologies for the Net Asset Value over 1 year.

40|$|Actuaries {{are often}} {{faced with the}} task of {{estimating}} tails of loss distributions from just a few observations. Thus estimates of tail probabilities (reinsurance prices) and percentiles (solvency capital requirements) are typically subject to substantial parameter uncertainty. We study the bias and MSE of estimators of tail probabilities and percentiles, with focus on 1 -parameter exponential families. Using asymptotic arguments it is shown that tail estimates are subject to significant positive bias. Moreover, the use of bootstrap predictive distributions, which has been proposed in the actuarial literature as a way of addressing parameter uncertainty, is seen to double the estimation bias. A bias corrected estimator is thus proposed. It is then shown that the MSE of the MLE, the parametric bootstrap and the bias corrected estimators only differ in terms of order O(n − 2), which provides decision-makers with some flexibility as to which estimator to use. The accuracy of asymptotic methods, even for small samples, is demonstrated exactly for the exponential and related distributions, while other 1 -parameter distributions are considered in a simulation study.

40|$|In the {{valuation}} of the Solvency II Capital Requirement, the correct appraisal of risk dependencies acquires particular relevance. These dependencies {{refer to the}} recognition of risk diversification in the aggregation process and there are different levels of aggregation and hence different types of diversification. For instance, for a non-life company at the first level the risk components of each single line of business (e. g. premium, reserve and CAT risks) need to be combined in the overall portfolio, the second level regards the aggregation of different kind of risks as, for example, market and underwriting risk, and finally various solo legal entities could be joined together in a <b>group.</b> <b>Solvency</b> II allows companies to capture these diversification effects in capital requirement assessment, but the identification of a proper methodology can represent a delicate issue. Indeed, while Internal Models by simulation approaches permit usually to obtain the portfolio multivariate distribution only in the independence case, generally the use of copula functions can consent to have the multivariate distribution under dependence assumptions too. However {{the choice of the}} copula and the parameter estimation could be very problematic when only few data are available. So it could be useful to find a closed formula based on Internal Models independence results with the aim to obtain the capital requirement under dependence assumption. A simple technique, to measure the diversification effect in capital requirement assessment, is the formula, proposed by Solvency II Quantitative Impact Studies (QIS), focused on the aggregation of capital charges, the latter equal to percentile minus average of total claims amount distribution of single line of business (LoB), using a linear correlation matrix. On the other hand, this formula produces the correct result only for a restricted class of distributions, while it may underestimate the diversification effect. In this paper we present an alternative method, based on the idea to adjust that formula with proper calibration factors (proposed by Sandström, (2007)) and appropriately extended with the aim to consider very skewed distribution too. In the last part considering different non-life multi-line insurers, we compare the Capital Requirements obtained, for only premium risk, applying the aggregation formula to the results derived by elliptical copulas and Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas...|$|R
40|$|Disaster-related {{economic}} losses are increasing globally; for example, in the 1 st quarter of 2010 alone, earthquakes in Haiti and Chile and the European storm Xynthia together resulted in losses of US 16 billion. Catastrophe or ‘CAT’ models are stochastic event-set based computer models {{that have been}} used for the last 25 years by the insurance and reinsurance industry to assess risk by estimating likely losses from extreme events, whether natural or manmade (e. g. terrorism). Their key application is in the assessment of risk to a portfolio of exposures, which are then used (i) to inform an insurer’s underwriting strategy (ii) to determine the premiums charged in hazard prone areas (iii) to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk (iv) to price reinsurance treaties Most CAT models are ‘black boxes’ which have traditionally limited the level of user interaction. New European regulations (Solvency II) require firms to understand the assumptions made in any CAT model used as part of their <b>solvency</b> <b>calculations,</b> resulting in the industry pushing for greater transparency from the modelling community. One of the issues arising is that CAT models can, in certain circumstances, underestimate financial losses, for example by overestimating building resilience in relation to hurricane models. The insurance industry needs clarity on the assumptions included in CAT models; for example, which components are well understood and which are uncertain? Therefore the insurance industry needs the flexibility, for example, to pick and choose hazard vulnerability and economic loss models from multiple vendors. Crucially, they {{need to be able to}} critique similar CAT models and understand the impact that changing single components will have on the outputs, thus requiring the development of open-access ‘plug and play’ catastrophe models. The NERC PURE (Predicting Uncertainty and Risk in the Environment) Research and Knowledge Exchange programme (co-sponsored by EPSRC, EA and TSB) is developing an experimental zone with the aim of producing a web-enabled zone to give unrestricted access to publicly available risk and uncertainty tools. This will enable the development of open-access ‘plug and play’ catastrophe models. Users will gain access to the best available models, tools and algorithms, linked using OpenMI and will enable data and model linkage within both an open and secure environment. OpenMI provides a standard interface, allowing models to exchange data with each other and other tools at runtime, facilitating the modelling of process interactions. Crucially, it allows models from different suppliers that represent processes based on different concepts and different spatial and temporal resolutions, even with no spatial references, to be joined together. This talk discusses how the PURE programme is engaging with the insurance and reinsurance industry to develop a prototype for ‘plug and play’ catastrophe models using model fusion, and looks forward to the possible impact of open-access modelling. As a proof-of-concept, a linked series of components which calculates the cost of damage from groundwater flood events has been created using OpenMI. This is based on a groundwater model of Marlborough and the Berkshire Downs, converted to flood depth, and combined with an economic damage model to produce occurrence exceedance probability curves for typical UK housing type...|$|R

Further, in analyzing affinity marketing one needs to acknowledge the power and nature of affinity. An affinity marketing strategy is focused on one of the four different aspects of affinity.

Second, affinity is based on relationships creating a sense of recognition in an organization that doesn't necessary have to exist (for instance a country, a family or an animal). Third, affinity comes from a sense of desiring to be part of a dissimilar social group (aspirational). Last, affinity is correlated to the wish for personally acquiring discounts, or privileges from goods and services sold by a specific organization (self-interest). But a few affinity groups use more than one of these facets to achieve their marketing scheme. For instance, very enthusiastic baseball fans support their team for a deserving cause, identify themselves in their team, and personally benefit from discounts and advantages.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{determination}} of the capital requirements represents the first Pillar of Solvency II. The main purpose of the new solvency regulation is to obtain more realistic modelling and assessment of the different risks insurance companies are exposed to in a balance–sheet perspective. In this context the Solvency Capital Requiremennt standard calculation {{is based on a}} modular approach where the overall risk is split into several modules and submodules. In Solvency II standard formula longevity risk is explicitly considered. Design/methodology/approach - It suggests a multiperiod approach for correctly calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement in a risk management perspective, {{in the sense that the}} amount of capital necessary to meet company future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force has to be assessed. The backtesting approach for measuring the consistency of SCR calculations for life insurance policies represents the main contribution of the research. In fact this kind of model performance is generally specified in the VaR validation analysis. in this paper, this approach is considered for testing the ex post performance of SCR calculation methodology. Findings - The backtesting framework is able to measure from time to time if the insurer has allocate more or less capital to support his in-force business, with adverse effects on free reserves and profitability or solvency. Research limitations/implications - In the Solvency II context, the insurance companies put aside the capital as regards the different kind of risk recognised by the QIS 5. In particular, in the regulation framework, SCR is intended to be "the amount of capital that an insurer needs in order to remain viable in the market and maintain its default probability below a certain level" 7. Nevertheless the balance-sheet approach prescribed by the new international guidelines could not adequately catch the effective impact of the longevity risk in the risk management valuations, given its specificity and incidence on long term portfolios. In this paper a multiperiod approach for correctly calculating the SCRs is proposed. The multiperiod perspective is in the sense that the amount of capital necessary to meet company future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force has to be assessed. In this setting, the aim of the research is to set out a backtesting framework for measuring the consistency of <b>Solvency</b> Capital Requirement <b>calculation</b> methodologies for life insurance portfolios. In this order of ideas, it is relevant to represent accurately the future mortality trend, as well as to consider the "right" tools to test the effectiveness of the formula or model which it is implemented to calculate the SCR.

Practical implications - Indeed the forecasting performance is an important aspect to assess the effectiveness of the model, a poor performance corresponding to a biased allocation of capital.

40|$|The three {{chapters}} all address solvency regulation issues, with a {{focus on}} market risks under the Solvency II framework. Chapter 1 deals with “high-level” aspects of Solvency II as main principles and the general structure. Chapters 2 and 3 will be devoted to quantitative issues. Chapter 1 describes the main evolutions that {{led to the development of}} Solvency II. The insurance sector has dramatically evolved during the last two decades. Among others developments, we stress the new risks faced by the sector as natural catastrophes, changing demographics or market risks. Insurers become international companies, investing almost 10 trillion € of assets in Europe at the end of 2014 and being increasingly intertwined with banks and other financial sectors. Financial innovation and the refinement of risk management techniques and models developed by companies have gained momentum among the major European insurance companies. Have these evolutions changed the needs for the supervisory of insurance companies? The economic foundation for regulation is based on the presence of market failures, including severe asymmetric information problems and principal-agent conflicts. Insurance consumers, particularly individuals and households, face significant challenges in judging the financial risk of insurers. But the importance of the insurance sector for financial stability has been increasing. A sound regulatory and supervisory system is necessary to maintain efficient, safe, fair and stable financial markets and promote growth and competition in the insurance sector. The difficult conditions experienced by the industry and the shortcomings of the previous regulatory and supervisory framework have forced regulators to take action to change the way in which they regulate insurance companies’ solvency. Recognizing the shortcomings of Solvency I, EU policy-makers undertook the Solvency II project. Solvency I was not consistently applied throughout EU as the directive allowed countries to implement insurance regulation in different ways. Moreover Solvency I did not consider risks fully or in detail. In life business, the major criticism was the lack of consideration of asset risks. Allowances for latest developments in risk management were also inadequate and companies could not use an internal model to calculate the solvency capital. Finally, the increasing presence of conglomerates and groups forced the insurance regulator to align some requirements with the banking regulation, Basel II/III. Due to the differences in their core business activities, banks and insurers regulators’ goal does not imply comparability of the overall capital charges. However, considering the asset side of the balance sheets, the investment portfolios of banks and insurers contain the same asset classes. In order to avoid regulatory arbitrage, the capital charges for the same amount and type of asset risk should be similar. Chapter 2 compares the main regulatory frameworks in Europe: Solvency II and the Swiss Solvency Test, SST, in Switzerland, {{with a focus}} on potential market implications. Both systems are quite advanced but some key differences need to be highlighted, including the treatment of assets, in particular sovereign bonds, the consideration of diversification or the risk measure applied. Solvency II uses a Value at Risk at 99. 5 % whereas the SST is based on a Tail Value at Risk at 99 %. Our approach is both qualitative and quantitative. In particular, based on a numerical example, we aim at quantifying the level of regulatory capital prescribed by the standard models. The numerical analysis reveals large differences between capital charges assigned to the same asset class under Solvency II and the SST. Solvency II penalizes investment in stocks, mainly due to a lower diversification benefit under the standard formula. On the other hand the SST model requires a higher capital for bonds, primary due to a stringent risk measure and confidence level. The treatment of EU sovereign bonds under Solvency II is another area of concern as it does not require any capital for spread risk. The question arises to what extent an internal model leads to different capital requirements as compared to the SST and Solvency II models. Therefore we apply an internal approach based on Monte Carlo simulation to derive the necessary capital based on the Value at Risk at 99. 5 % (in line with the Solvency II standard model) and on the Tail Value at Risk at 99 % (in line with the SST standard model). Internal models calculate capital requirements that more closely matches risks of insurers and promote a culture of risk management. To develop internal models, companies need incentives to properly manage their risks, i. e. decreasing capital requirements. One potential benefit of the standard model is that insurers who use it can be compared to one another, whereas internal models are by definition specific to individual insurers. One argument against the standard model is the possibility of some systemic risk. An unusual event in the capital or insurance market could encourage all insurers to take the exact same response, thereby causing a run in the market. The analysis shows that standard and internal models still display large discrepancies in their results, suggesting a long way ahead to achieve a harmonized view between the regulators and the insurance sector. The choice of a statistical model or the refinement of parameters are key concepts when setting up an internal model and appear to be critical in the <b>Solvency</b> Capital Requirement <b>calculation.</b> By calculating and comparing the market risk capital charges for a representative insurer under the Solvency II and the SST standard approach as well as an internal model, we are able to provide evidence that the regulatory framework might have an impact on asset portfolios. The main impacts would be a shift from long-term to shorter-term debt, an increase in the attractiveness of higher-rated corporate debt and government bonds, in particular EU sovereign bonds as the consequence of the special treatment under Solvency II, as well as low level of equity holdings. But it is unlikely that large-scale reallocations will happen in the short term, as transitional arrangements are likely to phase in the implementation of Solvency II over several years. The likely impact on assets portfolios could have also already been anticipating by insurers. Chapter 3 studies the effectiveness of the Solvency II reform to prevent the default probability faced by a life insurance company. The default risk leads to a consequence that policyholders might not get back their initial investment upon default of the insurance company. Therefore, policyholders are concerned with the issues like what probability the insurance company will become bankrupt and which amount they can expect to obtain after taking account of the default risk of the insurer. Starting from a theoretical life insurance company which sells a participation insurance policy containing only a savings component and a single premium inflow, we simulate a life insurance company on an eight-year time horizon. We focus only on market risks as there is no mortality risk attached to the insurance contract. Finally several policies and investment strategies will be analysed. The purpose of the chapter is to evaluate how Solvency II can prevent the company to collapse. The papers discussing Solvency II effectiveness are qualitative in nature. In particular there is little research on the accuracy of the standard formula with regard to the proclaimed ruin probability of 0. 5 % per year. To do so we compare the probability of default at maturity of the life insurance policy, i. e. if the company has to enough assets to pay what was promised to the policyholders, with the early probability of default forced by Solvency II based on standard and internal models. We have first to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement as laid down in the directive. One crucial point is the evaluation of liabilities. To do so we use an approach recently applied by the insurance sector called Least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC). The aim of Solvency II is to monitor insurers on an annual basis. The SCR level can then be interpreted as a regulatory barrier, consistent with a model developed by Grosen and Jørgensen (2002). Key drivers of the ruin probability at maturity include interest rate parameters, portfolio riskiness and investment strategies in bonds. The continuously decrease of interest rates creates a challenge for insurers, especially life insurers that suffer a double impact on their balance sheet: a valuation effect and a decreasing reinvestment returns of premiums and maturing bonds. The latter explain also the riskiness of rolling-bond strategies compared to duration matching strategies. By setting the confidence level to 99. 5 % per year, the regulator wants to ensure that the annual ruin probability equals to 0. 5 %. Since the SCR from our internal model equals the 0. 5 % quantile of the distribution, it exactly matches the targeted ruin probability. Our analysis reveals that the set-up and calibration of the Solvency II standard model are inadequate as the solvency capital derived by the standard formula overestimates the results of the internal model. This is mainly the consequence of an overestimated equity capital and a lower diversification benefit. The 0. 5 % proclaimed goal under Solvency II is not reached, being too conservative. One declared goal of the directive is to decrease the duration gap between assets and liabilities. Solvency II penalizes then rolling-bond strategies. The long-term feature of our policy should impact the level of regulatory capital. As Solvency II is based on a quantile measurement, we define the solvency capital using the default probability objective for different horizons. SCR is not systematically a decreasing function of the time horizon even if a decreasing form appears on long-term. This shows undoubtedly that a horizon effect exists in terms of measurement of solvency. As the standard model overestimated the internal model capital we expect a forced default probability higher than 0. 5 % under the Solvency II framework. The SCR barrier stops the company more often than it should be. This can be interpreted as one cost of regulation, i. e. closing down financially sound at maturity companies. The analysis of the evolution of default probabilities as a function of time horizon reveals that ruin probabilities at maturity lie always below the Solvency II objective. Furthermore the gap between the observed default at maturity and the Solvency II objective is increasing over time; the situation is even worse for longer-term insurance products. Finally stakeholders are more interested in their expected return than in the default probability. A cost of regulation defined as the difference between stakeholder’s returns with and without regulatory framework exists, particularly for shareholders.
