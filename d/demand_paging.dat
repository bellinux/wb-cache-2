25|$|A CPU sends {{relatively}} small channel {{programs to the}} controller via the channel to handle I/O tasks, which the channel and controller can, in many cases, complete without further intervention from the CPU (exception: those channel programs which utilize 'program controlled interrupts', PCIs, to facilitate program loading, <b>demand</b> <b>paging</b> and other essential system tasks).|$|E
25|$|On many systems, a program's {{virtual address}} may refer to data {{which is not}} {{currently}} in memory. The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data stores, like a hard drive, to store what would otherwise have to remain in main memory (RAM). As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available. When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) {{and replacing it with}} the data requested by the program. The program can then be resumed from the point where it was stopped. This scheme is generally known as <b>demand</b> <b>paging.</b>|$|E
25|$|RCA marketed a Spectra 70 {{computer}} {{line that}} was hardware, but not software, compatible with IBM's System/360 series. It also produced the RCA Series, which competed against the IBM System/370. This technology was leased to the English Electric company, which {{used it for}} their System 4 series, which were essentially RCA Spectra 70 clones. RCA's TSOS operating system was the first mainframe, <b>demand</b> <b>paging,</b> virtual memory operating system on the market. Despite significant investment, in 1971 RCA only had a 4% market share, and {{it was estimated that}} it would cost $500 million {{over the next five years}} to remain competitive with the IBM/370 series. On September 17, 1971 the RCA Board of Directors announced its decision to close its computer systems division (RCA-CSD), which would be written off as a $490 million company loss. Sperry Rand's UNIVAC division took over the RCA base in January 1972.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} operating systems, <b>demand</b> <b>paging</b> (as {{opposed to}} anticipatory paging) {{is a method}} of virtual memory management. In a system that uses <b>demand</b> <b>paging,</b> the operating system copies a disk page into physical memory only if an attempt is made to access it and that page is not already in memory (i.e., if a page fault occurs). It follows that a process begins execution with none of its pages in physical memory, and many page faults will occur until most of a process's working set of pages is located in physical memory. This {{is an example of}} a lazy loading technique.|$|E
50|$|EOS was {{preceded by}} and was binary {{executable}} compatible with the CDC VSOS operating system for Cyber 205. Like VSOS, EOS had <b>demand</b> <b>paged</b> virtual memory (the VS part) with 2 pages sizes for improved virtual memory performance with the ETA's faster hardware pipelines. Though it had roots in the interactive Livermore Time Sharing System (LTSS), VSOS was focused as a batch-oriented operating system. VSOS was not run at very many institutions and its application-oriented performance, while the historic focus for supercomputing, set its features behind the times because of its limited user base.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of program address trace data in a <b>demand</b> <b>paged</b> computer system having a three level staging hierarchy. Our primary objective is to explore the data both graphically and numerically, using methods that may be useful when other data traces become available. A secondary objective has been to fit plausible point-process type models to the data. It is believed that the present approach, combining data-analytic procedures with probability modeling, will prove useful in understanding program behavior and thus aid in the rational design of complex computer systems.

50|$|DG/UX 1.00, {{released}} in March, 1985, {{was based on}} UNIX System V Release 2 with additions from 4.1BSD. By 1987, DG/UX 3.10 had been released, with 4.2BSD TCP/IP networking, NFS and the X Window System included. DG/UX 4.00, in 1988, was a comprehensive re-design of the system, based on System V Release 3, and supporting symmetric multiprocessing on the Eclipse MV. The 4.00 filesystem {{was based on the}} AOS/VS II filesystem and, using the logical disk facility, could span multiple disks. DG/UX 5.4, released around 1991, replaced the legacy Unix file buffer cache with unified, <b>demand</b> <b>paged</b> virtual memory management. Later versions were based on System V Release 4.|$|R

50|$|Logical to {{physical}} address translation {{was carried out}} using a set of address translation tables. Each process has access to threeindependently extensible regions of memory, used typically for program, heap and stack. A fourth region was normally reserved for the operating system. The tables also contained a set of rights bits for each memory page giving full protection and supporting the implementation of <b>demand</b> <b>paged</b> virtual memory. The translation tables were cached in the CPU resulting, in most cases, in an overhead of only one microinstruction when performing address translation. The page size which was fixed by the hardware, was 4 Kbytes. Each logical region could be up to 256 Mbytes.|$|R

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of an {{operating}} system, a computer is managed and optimized in terms of the application programming model and the management of system resources. For the TFLOPS system, the problem is to manage and optimize large scale parallelism. This paper looks at the management in terms of three key topics: memory management, communication, and input/output. For memory management, we discuss some of the design decisions made including the appropriate use of <b>demand</b> <b>paged</b> virtual memory in the system. For communication, we describe the software protocols and interactions that permit a system of 4500 nodes to approach the maximum hardware performance. For I/O, we look at the problem of funneling data from many computation nodes to a small number of external devices...|$|R
50|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>paging</b> {{follows that}} pages {{should only be}} brought into memory if the {{executing}} process demands them.

50|$|By {{using the}} Motorola 68000 {{processor}} tightly {{coupled with the}} Sun-1 MMU the Sun 68000 CPU board was able to support a multi-tasking operating system such as UNIX.

The Sun-1 MMU was necessary because the Motorola 68451 MMU did not always work correctly with the 68000 and could not always restore the processor state after a page fault.|$|E
