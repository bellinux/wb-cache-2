5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He encouraged {{the development of}} a distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers. His poems were known for religious overtones with an emphasis on death and reunions with lost loved ones in the afterlife. Though he built up a mild reputation in <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> he was soon forgotten after his death.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|John McKay, born on Raasay in 1767, was {{supported}} by the MacLeod Chief as the foremost island piper of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> and an inheritor of the MacCrimmon tradition. His son Angus published a pibroch collection and was the first piper to Queen Victoria. The subsequent family members have emigrated from the island, and their direct descendent lives in Inveraray.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow wrote many lyric poems {{known for}} their musicality and often {{presenting}} stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> and also had success overseas.

5|$|Several of Eadbald's near {{relatives}} {{were involved in}} diplomatic marriages. King Anna of East Anglia married his daughter, Seaxburh, to Eorcenberht, and their daughter Eormenhild married Wulfhere of Mercia, {{one of the most}} powerful kings of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, married Oswiu, king of Northumbria and the last of the northern Angles Bede listed as holding imperium over southern England. Eadbald's granddaughter Eafe married Merewalh, king of the Magonsæte.|$|E
5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|As {{a naturalist}} {{he had a}} great curiosity, observing the geography, geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Indian Zoology although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> namely equal rights for African-Americans and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|For {{many of his}} eleven seasons, Hutson {{was also}} the Packers' kicker. He added 172 extra points on 183 {{attempts}} and seven field goals on 15 attempts for another league record 823 points. He {{led the league in}} extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in field goals made in 1943. As did almost all players in <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> Hutson played both offense and defense. On defense, he played safety and intercepted 30 passes over the final six years of his career. His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E

5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of <b>his</b> <b>day</b> — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would also mean the end of slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E
5|$|Hutson is {{considered}} {{to have been the}} first modern receiver, and is credited with creating many of the modern pass routes used in the NFL today. He was the dominant receiver of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> during which he was widely considered one of the greatest receivers in NFL history. He held almost all major receiving records {{at the time of his}} retirement, including career receptions, yards, and touchdowns. He was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Hutson's number 14 was the first jersey retired by the Packers, and he is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. In 1994, Hutson was selected for the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the greatest players of the NFL's first 75 years.|$|E
