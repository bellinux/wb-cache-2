5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> then arches it {{forward into the}} water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
25|$|On June 15, 2002, Debra Marshall {{called police}} to the couple's home Saturday night and told {{officers}} that Austin had beaten {{her on the}} <b>head,</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> legs then {{stormed out of the}} house before police arrived. According to police reports, Debra suffered a swollen cheek and eye and bruises to her back and shoulder. Austin called the house while officers were there and was told he was in trouble but declined a request to return to the house or report to the police station. On August 14, 2002, Austin {{was arrested and charged with}} domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, 2002 and was given a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.|$|E
25|$|In early August, the {{lightweight}} Breidis Prescott {{was chosen by}} Rubio as Khan's next opponent. Rubio had trained a fighter who had narrowly lost to Prescott before and thought that Khan {{would be able to}} handle the bigger Prescott, who had a prolific knock-out record of 17 KOs in 19 contests. On 6 September 2008, Khan was a huge favourite and was hoping to win a world title {{by the end of the}} year. Prescott came out fast in the fight and landed some good shots; a stiff jab jerked Khan's <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> foreshadowed what was to come. Prescott landed a left hook that jabbed Khan's temple; dizzying his senses. Instead of holding, Khan tried to punch back, but instead was punched on the head by a left hook, right hook combo, sending him crashing to the canvas. He managed to get to his feet. Prescott ended it for good with another left that put Khan down again. This time, he was unable to get up. It was officially over in 55 seconds.The fight was at the Manchester Evening News Arena on Khan's Sky Box Office debut.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the train enters the launch area. To {{the left of}} the launch area is a [...] "Christmas tree" [...] light, similar to those {{employed}} at the starting line of a drag strip. A brief message is played to the riders to: [...] "keep arms down, <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> hold on." [...] Once the train is prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. It then launches, accelerating to a speed of [...] in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the train begins its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees clockwise before climbing over the [...] top hat. Upon descending, the track twists 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes.|$|E
500|$|The Australian magpie {{produces}} {{a clutch of}} two to five light blue or greenish eggs, which are oval in shape and about [...] The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins; like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage. Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner. The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young. This does vary from region to region, and {{with the size of}} the group—the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, some {{of these}} lemurs are unaware of the danger humans pose and will {{approach}} humans on the ground.

2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell {{was a long way}} behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> with mouth wide open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924 his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter." [...] Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: [...] "People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, males tip their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away.

2500|$|Wei Yan {{was left}} with only his son(s) and a few followers. They fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase. Ma Dai caught up with Wei Yan, decapitated him, brought his <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> threw {{it in front of}} Yang Yi. Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan's head and said, [...] "You {{inferior}} slave! Now, can you still commit evil?" [...] Wei Yan's family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan's death, Jiang Wan had led divisions of the imperial guards from Chengdu to deal with the conflict. They had travelled for about 10 li (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan's death, after which they returned to Chengdu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common murre}} is [...] in length with a [...] wingspan. Male and female are indistinguishable {{in the field}} and weight ranges between [...] in the south of their range to [...] in the north. A weight range of [...] has been reported. In {{breeding}} plumage, the nominate subspecies (U. a. aalge) is black on the <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wings, and has white underparts. It has thin dark pointed bill and a small rounded dark tail. After the pre-basic moult, the face is white with a dark spur behind the eye. Birds of the subspecies U. a. albionis are dark brown rather than black, most obviously so in colonies in southern Britain. Legs are grey and the bill is dark grey. Occasionally, adults are seen with yellow/grey legs. In May 2008, an aberrant adult was photographed with a bright yellow bill.|$|E
2500|$|By 1898, Montojo {{returned}} to the Philippines again as Rear-Admiral, serving as general commander of all Spanish Philippine naval stations and taking part in operations against Filipino insurgents. At {{a meeting with the}} colony's captain general on March 15, 1898, he expressed his concerns that their forces would be destroyed by the U.S. in battle because of disadvantages, as it became apparent that war with the United States was increasingly likely. Of the thirty-seven ships in the Spanish naval forces stationed in the Philippines, the majority were small gunboats, so there were only seven ships that would be used to take on the U.S. Asiatic Squadron. In addition there were other problems facing the Spaniards. Their force did not possess enough adequate mines, and some of the ones they did have were missing components. The admiral requested additional supplies from the homeland but these were ultimately not delivered. In the end, Montojo decided to send the squadron to Subig bay to the northwest of Manila, which would be easier to defend for the Spanish when the American ships arrived. If they ignored them and head for Manila, he believed they could then <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> ambush the U.S. squadron at night.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing an teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a [...] "mysterious living weapon"—a staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from his eyelids and extending over {{the top of his head}} in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on his <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted in the center of his forehead.|$|E
