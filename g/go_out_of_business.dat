5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in the 1950s and 1960s, putting {{many people in}} the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E
5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000 a {{consortium}} led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended {{to relocate to}} Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently {{the appointment of a}} three-man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium mk, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but were forced to officially renounce this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, however these plans have major negative repercussions for the future of Kingsmeadow and Kingstonian F.C..|$|E

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} company would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{if it did not}} receive a large {{infusion}} of cash, Iacocca approached the United States Congress in 1979 and successfully requested a loan guarantee. In order to obtain the guarantee, Chrysler was required to reduce costs and abandon some longstanding projects, such as the turbine engine, which had been ready for consumer production in 1979 after nearly 20 years of development.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that the newsstand might <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> principally because its unique function of supplying yesterday's newspapers was made obsolete by the ability to read them online. The physical structure also required {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in repairs. In January 2009, a new owner, Muckey's Corporation, won a bidding competition and signed a lease to take over the newsstand. Muckey's diversified the stand's offering with more typical magazines and convenience store fare, but maintained the original name.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2014, SpaceX {{capabilities}} and pricing had {{also begun to}} affect the market for launch of US military payloads. For nearly a decade the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) had faced no competition for military launches. Anticipating a slump in domestic military and spy launches, ULA stated that it would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> unless it won commercial satellite launch orders. To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, the North Shore highway was built, {{which helped}} make the North Shore {{accessible}} by land. At the same time commercial fishermen began to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> as catches declined. Many of these fishermen built cabins and resorts, which were inhabited by more rich people on recreational trips. Certain exclusive clubs also bought land for resort and sport purposes. The Naniboujou Club Lodge was built to attract an exclusive clientele, {{and a group of}} Duluth businessmen, the Tettegouche Club, bought 9,346 acres (37.8km²) of land for use as a private retreat.|$|E
25|$|They have {{plunged into}} their {{dangerous}} experiment {{without regard for}} the consequences...

25|$|As of 2010 five flower {{shops are}} located along Fannin {{in a section}} of Midtown. One decade before 2010 there were over one dozen flower shops in that area. In 2003 the flower shop owners were mostly Asian. The shops, along four city blocks, were {{centered}} on Rosedale Street. The number declined after {{the establishment of the}} METRORail Red Line. Nancy Sarnoff of the Houston Chronicle said in 2010 that the remaining flower shops told her that the establishment of the line helped cause several of their competitors to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{recession}} in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> This {{had the effect of}} blurring the lines between the keiretsu: Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.|$|E
25|$|After the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission {{rejected}} Penn Central's {{proposals for}} construction of a high rise building atop Grand Central Terminal, Penn Central filed suit against the city, arguing that under the New York Historical Preservation Law, it was entitled to a reasonable return {{on the value of}} its property, whereas in the existing condition, Grand Central Terminal could not break even and because (a) as a regulated railroad it could not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> and (b) it was in bankruptcy, it could not cease the deficit-causing operations, thus suffering a taking of its property, for which it was entitled to compensation. The trial court agreed.|$|E
25|$|The {{downward}} trend continued, with the 1950s seeing more industries {{served by the}} railroad <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> By 1959, all mail service via the Sussex Branch stopped, and the last milk train ran in November 1964. The last passenger train departed from Branchville on July 10, 1966; the last passenger train from Newton on July 13, 1966; and the last passenger train on the entire branch pulled away from Andover on October 2, 1966. By 1969, all track formerly owned by the Sussex Railroad was completely out of service, {{with the exception of}} the former South Vernon extension, which is still used today by the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway on its way to Syracuse and Utica, New York.|$|E

25|$|In {{place of}} Riesling, the easier {{cultivated}} Müller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings like Kerner (4.6%) were planted {{in large quantities}} on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and which in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative consequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a lower quality than Riesling wines {{which in turn has}} a depressing economic effect on the prices of all Mosel wines. While consumers have benefited with top quality Riesling wines being underpriced in comparison with some of the world's other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and California, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel vineyards to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Cleveland Browns {{were founded}} and started play in 1946 in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a league formed {{to compete with}} the more {{established}} National Football League (NFL). The team was a success both financially and on the field under head coach Paul Brown, drawing large crowds and winning all four of the AAFC's championships between 1946 and 1949. In a bid to end a competition for talent that raised player salaries and ate into owners' profits at a time when attendance in many large markets was declining, the NFL and AAFC agreed to a peace deal {{at the end of the}} 1949 season. Under the deal, four of the AAFC's seven teams were to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> while three of them – the Browns, Baltimore Colts and San Francisco 49ers – would play in the NFL starting in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Hill did {{not play}} for Somerset after the 1951 season, but {{remained}} intimately connected with the county side {{as a reporter for}} the County Gazette and on the club's committees. In 1953, after the side had finished {{at the bottom of the}} County Championship for two consecutive seasons and with the threat that it might <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> he and two other journalists organised a special meeting of the club which called for wholesale changes in the organisation and the committee. Their motions were defeated, but the three were recruited to the committee and Hill was made captain of the second eleven. Somerset embarked on a process of recruitment of cricketers from other counties and from overseas that transformed its fortunes by the end of the 1950s. He was also a freelance sports correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, wrote an article for the first-ever edition of The Sunday Telegraph, and travelled to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to report on England's overseas Test matches.|$|E
