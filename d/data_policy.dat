40|$|The {{conclusions}} of research articles generally depend on bodies {{of data that}} cannot {{be included in the}} articles themselves. The sharing of this data is important for reasons of both transparency and possible reuse. Science, Technology and Medicine journals have an obvious role in facilitating sharing, but how they might do that is not yet clear. The Journal Research Data (JoRD) Project was a JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee) funded feasibility study on the possible shape of a central service on journal research <b>data</b> <b>policies.</b> The objectives of the study included, amongst other considerations: to identify the current state of journal <b>data</b> sharing <b>policies</b> and to investigate the views and practices of stakeholders to data sharing. The project confirmed that a large percentage of journals do not have a <b>policy</b> on <b>data</b> sharing, and that there are inconsistencies between the traceable journal <b>data</b> sharing <b>policies.</b> Such a state leaves authors unsure of whether they should deposit data relating to articles and where and how to share that data. In the absence of a consolidated infrastructure for the easy sharing of data, a journal <b>data</b> sharing model <b>policy</b> was developed. The model policy was developed from comparing the quantitative information gathered from analysing existing journal <b>data</b> <b>policies</b> with qualitative <b>data</b> collected from the stakeholders concerned.

40|$|Following open <b>data</b> <b>policies</b> worldwide, an {{increasing}} number of public organisations has now published open data that is free to be used by anyone. However, despite the significant increase in use of this open data, the open data providers are mostly not aware of their users {{and the way in which}} the data is actually re-used. This is rooted in the principle that open data should be free to use without prior user registration in order to avoid any unnecessary barriers for reuse of the data. However, understanding use and user needs of open data is important to improve the provision of open data and the successful implementation of open <b>data</b> <b>policies.</b> We explored the use of log files of the actual use of open data to identify the users and to explore how the open data is being used. By means of a case study in which we apply log file analytics to the Dutch open geographical data portal we show that this approach is promising for analysing open data use. This approach will yield many new insights for open data providers to improve and fine-tune their open <b>data</b> offer and <b>policy</b> makers will be provided with data on actual use to evaluate their open <b>data</b> <b>policies.</b> Our analysis shows that citizens are a much heavier user of open data than currently assumed: citizens as major users of open government data should be taken much more seriously in the demand driven open <b>data</b> <b>policies.</b> We recommend transferring the pilot project into a permanent monitoring instrument for open data use and exploring additional analytics for using the rich data that log files provide for.
