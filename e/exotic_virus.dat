[...] One of the most urgent of Chemical Corps projects in the period 1960 to 1961 was the effort to achieve a standard chemical incapacitating agent. For several years attention had been fixed on the military potentialities of the psychochemicals of various types. Research on new agents tended to concentrate on viral and rickettsial diseases. A whole range of <b>exotic</b> <b>virus</b> diseases prevalent in tropical areas came within the screening program in 1960-61, with major effort directed at increased first hand knowledge of so-called arbovirues (i.e. arthropod borne viruses).

40|$|Summary: Neuroimaging plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{diagnosis}} and therapeutic decision making in infectious diseases of the nervous system. The review summarizes imaging findings and recent advances in the diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscess, ventriculitis, viral disease including <b>exotic</b> and emergent <b>viruses,</b> and opportunistic disease. For each condition, the ensuing therapeutic steps are presented. In cases of uncomplicated meningitis, cranial computed tomography (CT) appears to be sufficient for clinical management to exclude acute brain edema, hydrocephalus, and pathology of the base of skull. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior in depicting complications like sub-/epidural empyema and vasculitic complications notably on FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) -weighted images. The newer technique of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows early parenchymal complications of meningitis earlier and with more clarity and is of help in differentiation of pyogenic abscess (PA) from ring enhancing lesions of other etiology. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PMRS) seems to produce specific peak patterns in cases of abscess. The presence of lactate cytosolic amino acids and absence of choline seems to indicate PA. Also in cases of suspected opportunistic infection due to toxoplasma DWI may be of help in the differentiation from lymphoma, showing no restriction of water diffusion. In patients with herpes simplex and more <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses</b> like West Nile and Murray Valley virus DWI allows earlier lesion detection and therapeutic intervention with virustatic drugs...|$|R

This paper is a review of the general characteristics, the epidemiology, and laboratory diagnosis of the exotic viruses which have been described during the last 25 years. Epidemics of hemorrhagic fever, now known to be caused by arenaviruses, were first recognized in Argentina in 1956 [1], in Bolivia in 1959 [2], and in West Africa in 1969 [3]. In 1967 a hemorrhagic disease outbreak caused by a newly recognized virus, the Marburg virus, occurred simultaneously among laboratory workers in Germany and Yugoslavia [4]. In 1976 extensive outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever, caused by still another newly recognized virus, the Ebola virus, occurred in Southern Sudan and Northern Zaire [5].

40|$|Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in Australia in 2002. It {{subsequently}} was found widely dispersed around the continent and was shown to be seedborne in wheat. The coat protein (CP) gene sequences of nine WSMV isolates from eastern and southwestern Australia are reported, one obtained directly from infected wheat seed, three from seedlings grown from infected wheat seed, and five from infected wheat plant samples. These sequences were compared with those of 66 WSMV CP sequences, including eight previously sequenced Australian isolates. All 17 Australian sequences formed a closely knit monophyletic cluster as part of the D 1 subclade of WSMV previously only reported from the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The close phylogenetic relationships of these sequences indicate that the Australian outbreak arose from a single incursion, the source of which appears to be the Pacific Northwest. Three Australian CP sequences were identical, one from the location of the post-entry quarantine facility at Tamworth, New South Wales, and two from seed that had originally been propagated at that facility. These three sequences were closest to the Pacific Northwest sequences and differed from them by as little as eight nucleotides (0. 76 %). The sequence of a third seedborne isolate originally from the same source differed from the other two seedborne isolates by two nucleotides, indicating that the immigrant WSMV population may have been variable. The other Australian sequences differed from the three identical ones by only one to four nucleotides. The phylogenetic pattern and small number of nucleotide differences between individual isolates from different geographic locations fit the scenario that the virus was introduced once in seed of wheat breeding material, multiplied where it was introduced, and then was dispersed over long distances around the Australian continent along standard distribution routes for wheat breeding lines, germ plasm, and crop seed. These conclusions provide a cautionary tale indicating the importance of effective monitoring of imported plant materials for <b>exotic</b> <b>virus</b> diseases during post-entry quarantine...|$|E
40|$|It {{is unknown}} how the current Asian origin highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza H 5 viruses arrived, but these viruses are now poised to become endemic in North America. Wild birds harbor these viruses and have dispersed them at regional scales. What is unclear {{is how the}} viruses may be moving from the wild bird reservoir into poultry holdings. Active surveillance of live wild birds is likely {{the best way to}} determine the true distribution of these viruses. We also suggest that sampling be focused on regions with the greatest risk for poultry losses and attempt to define the mechanisms of transfer to enhance biosecurity. Responding to the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in North America requires an efficient plan with clear objectives and potential management outcomes. Background The original United States interagency strategic plan for detection of Asian highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 avian influ-enza was developed nearly a decade ago, with focus on the early detection of an <b>exotic</b> <b>virus</b> [1]. The current out-breaks of HPAI H 5 N 8 and H 5 N 2, caused by foreign origin viruses, have very quickly become widely distributed within North America, thus negating the need for early detection at the broad scale. Two new avian influenza sur-veillance and monitoring documents have been recently released that address early detection at local and regional scales. One focuses on detection of HPAI in waterfowl in high priority watersheds and the spread of viruses to new areas of concern [2]. The other encompasses a strategy for early detection of avian influenza viruses of significance in wild birds in general, and encourages sampling of areas with high poultry density [3]. We propose taking these plans a step further by suggesting a 2 -tiered surveillance strategy focusing on waterfowl and bridge species in the vicinity of poultry operations. This 2 -step sampling design would address the mechanism(s) of virus transfer and pro-vide data that can inform management actions that minimize the impact of these viruses on domestic poultry.

40|$|Both pseudorabies {{virus and}} the various strains of avian sarcoma and {{leukosis}} viruses are economically important pathogens. In Canada, pseudorabies is an <b>exotic</b> <b>virus</b> which primarily infects swine. The disease is rapidly fatal in most species although adult pigs may become carriers. Because pseudorabies virus (PrV) is exotic to Canada, imported animals are rigorously tested {{for the presence of}} antibody titers to the virus. The leukosis caused by Rous associated virus (RAV) has a major impact on the health of poultry flocks. Different strains of the avian leukosis viruses cause damage of differing severity but the general characteristics of infection include decreases in both egg and meat production. There would be significant benefits if non-infectious, antigenic fractions from both of these viruses could be produced in bacterial cells. These proteins could be used in serum antibody testing to make the detection of both viruses considerably simpler than the currently used ELISA and virus neutralization tests. As well, the production of large quantities of RAV env protein could simplify studies of the mechanisms of host specificity and provide additional information about chicken cell receptors. I have attempted to produce an antigenically recognizable protein from both pseudo-rabies virus and Rous associated virus. Attempts were made to express such a protein from pseudorabies virus by cloning either cDNA or genomic DNA fragments into plasmid vectors followed by colony immunodetection using a polyclonal antibody against PrV prepared in pig. Although several recombinants produced positive immunological results, further examination showed that none contained PrV DNA sequences. Standard screening methods were modified and improved {{during the course of this}} work. Subsequently, other laboratories identified significant difficulties in using unpurified polyclonal antibodies prepared in swine which provided an explanation for the results I observed. A cDNA library constructed from RNA prepared from RAV- 1 was screened using a probe prepared from env sequences in pSR-XD 2, a plasmid containing much of the RSV sequence. Transformants containing RSV homologous DNA were identified. During purification of these clones and subsequent screenings many of the plasmids identified as containing RSV homologous sequence lost their inserts. Additional studies demonstrated that plasmids which exhibited the strongest homology with the RSV probe and which contained the longest inserts, lost these inserts at a high rate. A second cDNA cloning using a different bacterial host and a different viral strain (RAV- 2) produced several positive clones, with insert lengths ranging from 250 by to 950 bp. These inserts were sequenced and compared to known RSV and RAV sequences. A high degree of homology was observed. The longest RAV- 2 cDNA fragments included most of the env gp 37 polypeptide coding region. In order to test for expression of an antigen, inserts from two independently isolated recombinants were subcloned into lambdagt 11 in each of the three reading frames. A polyclonal antibody prepared against Rous sarcoma virus was used to test for the expression of any recognizable antigenic determinants. No antigen production was detected even though nucleic acid plaque hybridizations demonstrated that the subcloning had been successful in introducing RAV- 2 sequences into lambdagt 11. Possible explanations for this, as well as a discussion of the composition of the RAV- 2 sequences and their placement on the RSV genetic map are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{south-west}} Australian floristic {{region is}} one of 36 United Nations global hotspots of international species diversity. Considering the high biodiversity of the flora, {{it is likely that}} the plant virus flora is also abundant and genetically diverse, although only 15 indigenous plant viruses have been described from the flora of Western Australia. Colonisation of Australia by foreign powers from the 1830 s onwards saw the introduction of thousands of exotic plant species and their pathogens, including plant viruses. Clearance of the original flora for agriculture and housing has created interfaces between the new exotic flora of exotic crops, pastures, gardens and weeds and the remnants of the original one. The actions of humans and the creation of these interfaces between ecosystems have provided opportunities for <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses</b> to interact with indigenous plants, and for indigenous viruses to interact with exotic hosts. A component of this thesis describes studies to gain a greater understanding of the identity and evolution of the plant viruses present in the indigenous flora of Western Australia and how viruses are adapting to new host opportunities. A metagenomics approach was used to identify virus-like sequences from plant samples along transects that spanned interfaces between highly modified, partially modified and relatively unmodified sites. 78 novel viruses were identified. Most of these were from indigenous plants, and analysis of them confirmed our hypothesis that viruses of this indigenous flora are abundant, genetically diverse and largely unknown. None of the viruses found in indigenous plants also occurred in the exotic plants sampled, or vice versa. The <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses,</b> Catharanthus mosaic virus, barley yellow dwarf virus and white clover mosaic virus, were found in exotic plants at ecosystem interfaces, but not in indigenous plants, suggesting that viral movement across exotic-indigenous floral interfaces may not be widespread. Despite these findings, the continuing invasion by <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses,</b> as evidenced by our discovery in Australia of Catharanthus mosaic virus, demonstrates the failure of quarantine practices to prevent new viruses arriving, thereby posing potential threats to indigenous plants. An indigenous virus might extend its host range to infect exotic weeds or crop plants. We used yellow tailflower mild mottle virus (YTMMV) as a model to test how an indigenous virus might interact with exotic hosts it had never encountered before. YTMMV is a contact-transmissible tobamovirus isolated from endemic Anthocercis species (family Solanaceae). An isolate of YTMMV was passaged through plants of Nicotiana benthamiana, tomato and black nightshade, and its genome was sequenced after every passage to determine the presence of nonsynonymous (NS) and synonymous nucleotide substitutions. Only one fixed NS nucleotide substitution was observed in the intervening region (IR) of the viral genome, and it occurred only in tomato. The passages through tomato were repeated, and a different single NS substitution occurred adjacent to the NS substitution that occurred in the first passage experiment. This finding suggested that NS substitutions in the IR of YTMMV were being selected in tomato. Tobamovirus virions are famously stable under a range of treatments. An assessment of the durability of YTMMV virions under different treatments such as time under different temperature regimes, incubation in milk solution and sodium hydroxide was done. YTMMV was shown to be more resilient to inactivation using these treatments than related viruses, tobacco mosaic virus and green cucumber mild mosaic virus. The study into transmissibility and longevity of virions of YTMMV is a pre-emptive study that will be applicable should YTMMV spill over into crops. The study of plant virus biodiversity in the wild and at the interface of ecosystems will increase our understanding of how viruses influence ecosystems, particularly on resilience to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, longevity and fecundity. The potential application of such knowledge to agriculture is important, but it is as yet unacknowledged because of the dearth of examples. A far greater research effort is needed to understand the roles viruses play in ecosystems and the molecular mechanisms by which these are achieved. These areas are where in-depth studies of wild plant-virus interactions will have their greatest impact...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe “Asian tiger mosquito”, Aedes albopictus, {{is highly}} invasive, an {{aggressive}} biter {{and a major}} arbovirus vector. It is not currently present on mainland Australia despite being intercepted on numerous occasions at international ports and infesting the Torres Strait of Australia since at least 2004. In the current paper, we describe the invasion and current status of Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait, as well as research conducted to assess the threat of this species becoming established in arbovirus transmission cycles on the Australian mainland. Genetic analysis of the invading population demonstrated that the Indonesian region was the likely origin of the invasion and not Papua New Guinea (PNG) as initially suspected. There was also intermixing between Torres Strait, PNG and Indonesian populations, indicating that the species could be re-introduced into the Torres Strait compromising any successful eradication programme. Vector competence experiments with endemic and <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses</b> revealed that Ae. albopictus from the Torres Strait are efficient alphavirus vectors, but less efficient flavivirus vectors. Ae. albopictus obtains blood meals {{from a range of}} vertebrate hosts (including humans), indicating that it could play a role in both zoonotic and human-mosquito arbovirus transmission cycles in Australia. Predictive models coupled with climate tolerance experiments suggest that a Torres Strait strain of Ae. albopictus could colonise southern Australia by overwintering in the egg stage before proliferating in the warmer months. Cohabitation experiments demonstrated that the presence of Aedes notoscriptus larvae in containers would not prevent the establishment of Ae. albopictus. Evidence from these studies, coupled with global experience suggests {{that we need to be}} prepared for the imminent invasion of Australia by Ae. albopictus by thoroughly understanding its biology and being willing to embrace emerging control technologies...|$|R

This review collates data from studies that have evaluated the performance of FMDV vaccines at the individual and population level in pigs, and identifies research priorities that could provide new insights to improve vaccination in the future...|$|R
40|$|To detect five plant viruses (Beet black scorch virus, Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus, Eggplant mottled dwarf virus, Pelargonium zonate spot virus, and Rice yellow mottle virus) for quarantine purposes, {{we designed}} 15 RT-PCR primer sets. Primer design {{was based on}} the nucleotide sequence of the coat protein gene, which is highly conserved within species. All but one primer set successfully amplified the targets, and gradient PCRs indicated that the optimal temperature for the 14 useful primer sets was 51. 9 °C. Some primer sets worked well regardless of annealing temperature while others required a very specific annealing temperature. A primer specificity test using plant total RNAs and cDNAs of other plant virus-infected samples demonstrated that the designed primer sets were highly specific and generated reproducible results. The newly developed RT-PCR primer sets would be useful for quarantine inspections aimed at preventing the entry of <b>exotic</b> plant <b>viruses</b> into Korea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Detection and {{preventing}} entry of <b>exotic</b> <b>viruses</b> and viroids {{at the border}} is critical for protecting plant industries trade worldwide. Existing post entry quarantine screening protocols rely on time-consuming biological indicators and/or molecular assays that require knowledge of infecting viral pathogens. Plants have developed the ability to recognise and respond to viral infections through Dicer-like enzymes that cleave viral sequences into specific small RNA products. Many studies reported {{the use of a}} broad range of small RNAs encompassing the product sizes of several Dicer enzymes involved in distinct biological pathways. Here we optimise the assembly of viral sequences by using specific small RNA subsets. Results We sequenced the small RNA fractions of 21 plants held at quarantine glasshouse facilities in Australia and New Zealand. Benchmarking of several de novo assembler tools yielded SPAdes using a kmer of 19 to produce the best assembly outcomes. We also found that de novo assembly using 212 ̆ 013250 nt small RNAs can result in chimeric assemblies of viral sequences and plant host sequences. Such non-specific assemblies can be resolved by using 212 ̆ 013220 nt or 240 nt small RNAs subsets. Among the 21 selected samples, we identified contigs with sequence similarity to 18 viruses and 3 viroids in 13 samples. Most of the viruses were assembled using only 212 ̆ 013220 nt long virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs), except for one Citrus endogenous pararetrovirus that was more efficiently assembled using 240 nt long viRNAs. All three viroids found in this study were fully assembled using either 212 ̆ 013220 nt or 240 nt viRNAs. Optimised analysis workflows were customised within the Yabi web-based analytical environment. We present a fully automated viral surveillance and diagnosis web-based bioinformatics toolkit that provides a flexible, user-friendly, robust and scalable interface for the discovery and diagnosis of viral pathogens. Conclusions We have implemented an automated viral surveillance and diagnosis (VSD) bioinformatics toolkit that produces improved viruses and viroid sequence assemblies. The VSD toolkit provides several optimised and reusable workflows applicable to distinct viral pathogens. We envisage that this resource will facilitate the [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} vapor {{is used as}} {{a medical}} sterilant and as room disinfectant. Hydrogen peroxide has the advantage that it decomposes to form oxygen and water thus leaving no long term residues, but hydrogen peroxide as with most other strong oxidants is hazardous, and solutions are a primary irritant. The vapor is hazardous to the respiratory system and eyes and consequently the OSHA permissible exposure limit is 1 ppm (29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1) calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average and the NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit is 75 ppm. Therefore, engineering controls, personal protective equipment, gas monitoring etc. should be employed where high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are used in the workplace. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is one of the chemicals approved for decontamination of anthrax spores from contaminated buildings, such as occurred during the 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. It has also been shown to be effective in removing <b>exotic</b> animal <b>viruses,</b> such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease from equipment and surfaces.|$|R

40|$|<b>Exotic</b> Newcastle Disease <b>Virus</b> (ENDV) cause {{extremely}} rapid {{mortality in}} chickens after {{exposure to the}} virus. People rely heavily on poultry to provide protein and income in many places where NDV is not effectively controlled through vaccination and biosecurity. Losses from NDV contribute to worldwide hunger and poverty. It {{may be possible to}} use genetic selection to produce chickens that have a stronger immune response in the face of NDV challenge. For genetic selection to be successful, two major elements are required: differences in immune response among chickens and genetic control of these differences. This study clearly demonstrated the existence of both these factors. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of genetic selection to produce chickens that are more resistant to NDV and thereby lessen the burdens of hunger and poverty...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Current control {{strategies}} for avian influ-enza <b>virus,</b> <b>exotic</b> Newcastle disease, and other highly virulent poultry diseases often include surveillance, quarantine, depopulation, disposal, and disinfection. On-farm depopulation and disposal methods reduce po-tential movement of virus and improve biosecurity. Wa-ter-based foam depopulation was {{developed as a}} poten-tial alternative mass emergency poultry depopulation procedure. The use of water-based foam is condition-ally approved by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for use with floor-reared birds. This study reports {{on the use of}} water-based foam to de-populate other species including call ducks, chukars, Pekin ducks, and Japanese quail. Foam caused a rapid onset of airway occlusion. Although all species tested were depopulated with water-based foam, the time to cessation of activity varied by species, with quail being faster than chukars, broilers, and ducks. Use of water-based foam to depopulate ducks and other specie...|$|R
