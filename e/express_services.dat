5|$|Coach {{services}} {{running through}} Sheffield are operated by National Express {{and to a}} lesser extent Megabus, part of the Stagecoach Group. National <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> call at Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus services only call at Meadowhall. National <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis. The 560/564 service is a direct connection to London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports respectively. Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness respectively.|$|E
5|$|The western (Brighton) side, {{comprising}} platforms 9–19, is the terminus for Southern and Gatwick <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> to Surrey and Sussex, including Gatwick Airport and Brighton on the Brighton Main Line and the East Grinstead branch on the Oxted Line.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} famous trains have been {{associated}} with King's Cross, such as the Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh. The Gresley A3 and later streamlined A4 Pacific steam locomotives handled <b>express</b> <b>services</b> from the 1930s until 1966. The most famous of these was Mallard, which holds the world speed record for steam locomotives at , set in 1938.|$|E
5000|$|On 21 October 1968 {{a special}} <b>express</b> <b>service</b> with no number was started, {{with a yellow}} sign that said [...] "EXPRESS" [...] hanging at every bus stop the <b>express</b> <b>service</b> serves. In early 1970 the service was {{designated}} an <b>express</b> <b>service</b> of Route 2. On 1 November 1973 the <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was cancelled and replaced by the newly designated route 20.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{extended}} two stops northward to 57th Street on July 10, 1919. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> between Times Square and Union Square was inaugurated on this date. Previously, <b>express</b> <b>service</b> terminated at Union Square, with local service terminating at Times Square. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> {{then began to}} terminate at Times Square, with local service terminating at the new 57th Street station. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> between Manhattan and Pacific Street began to run at all times except late nights.|$|R
5000|$|Express: <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> {{between the}} Magic Kingdom and the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC). <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> {{runs on the}} outer loop of this route and travels counter-clockwise.|$|R
5|$|Bus {{services}} are operated chiefly by Arriva Kent & Sussex, providing local town and rural services to Tonbridge, Paddock Wood and Sevenoaks, {{as well as}} <b>express</b> <b>services</b> to locations such as Bromley and Maidstone. Eastbourne and Brighton on the south coast are accessible on services run by Stagecoach in Eastbourne and Brighton & Hove respectively, and Metrobus operates hourly services to Crawley.|$|E
5|$|Great Western trains {{included}} long-distance <b>express</b> <b>services</b> {{such as the}} Flying Dutchman, the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express. It also operated many {{suburban and}} rural services, some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains. The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It operated a network of road motor (bus) routes, {{was a part of}} the Railway Air Services, and owned ships, docks and hotels.|$|E
5|$|Between 1904 and 1908, one of {{the main}} service {{patterns}} was the West Side Branch, running from Lower Manhattan to Van Cortlandt Park via what is now the Lexington Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines. There were both local and <b>express</b> <b>services</b> with express trains south of 96th Street. Some express trains ran to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn via the Joralemon Street Tunnel during rush hours while all other trains turned around at City Hall or South Ferry.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1900, {{the line}} was electrified. Between 1914 and 1916 {{construction}} was undertaken to install a third track to provide <b>express</b> <b>service</b> on the line during peak hours. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> commenced on January 17, 1916.|$|R
50|$|Holiday and Saturday <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was {{discontinued}} on March 20, 1954. At {{some point}} afterwards, weekday midday <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was discontinued, but was restored on November 29, 1971, before being discontinued again by August 29, 1975.|$|R
5|$|There are two express {{tracks on}} the {{northern}} part of the route and one on the southern, with express stations distributed along the line. However, <b>express</b> <b>service</b> has only operated once on the line from 1968 to 1987. Restoration of <b>express</b> <b>service</b> has been thwarted by budget shortages, passenger opposition, and a serious signal fire at Bergen Street in 1999. The issue came to a head in June 2007, when a petition for <b>express</b> <b>service</b> reached 2,600 signatures and gained media attention. The Culver Line underwent repairs from 2009 until early 2013, during which the express tracks were replaced and rehabilitated which may facilitate future <b>express</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and <b>express</b> <b>services.</b> Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
5|$|From 18 November 1945, {{the daily}} Oslo–Bergen trains again ran via Roa, while the local trains from Oslo to Hønefoss {{increased}} to three daily round trips. Three weekly night trains were introduced from 1946. From 2 January to 1 May 1947, there was four weekly <b>express</b> <b>services</b> from Oslo to Geilo on the Bergen Line. By 1950, {{the situation had}} normalized and there were daily day and night trains and three weekly express trains—the latter with no stops between Hønefoss and Oslo. Kvellsrud Station opened on 18 August 1952.|$|E
5|$|Preston {{railway station}} serves {{the city of}} Preston in Lancashire, England, and is a major station on the West Coast Main Line, and is the {{notional}} half-way point on the WCML between London Euston and Glasgow Central 194 miles from Glasgow Central and 206 from London Euston although the actual half-way point is at Leyland, approximately 6 miles south. It is served by Northern, Virgin Trains, and TransPennine <b>Express</b> <b>services,</b> plus Caledonian Sleeper overnight services between London and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of <b>express</b> <b>service</b> become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having <b>express</b> <b>service</b> brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier <b>express</b> <b>service,</b> <b>express</b> trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|R
5|$|The lower-level express platforms, while {{built with}} the rest of the station, were only {{operated}} between 1968 and 1976 when <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was operated along the line. They were permanently removed from service in 1992, and support facilities were added to the platforms. There are no plans to restore <b>express</b> <b>service</b> to the station, even with the proposed introduction of rush-hour F <b>express</b> <b>service</b> on the IND Culver Line in fall 2017 (see below).|$|R
50|$|On January 18, 1976 F <b>express</b> <b>service</b> between Bergen Street and Church Avenue was {{discontinued}} during {{rush hours}} in the non-peak direction. On August 30, 1976 <b>express</b> <b>service</b> between Bergen Street and Church Avenue was completely discontinued, with all trains making all stops. Rush direction alternate-train <b>express</b> <b>service</b> between Ditmas Avenue and Kings Highway was retained. This was due to budget cuts and continuing complaints about reduced Manhattan service by riders at local stations.|$|R
5|$|The GO system {{map shows}} seven train lines (or corridors), all departing from Toronto's Union Station and mostly named {{respectively}} after the outer terminus of train service. Although colours are assigned in a consistent fashion to each line in all official media, in colloquial parlance lines are only ever {{referred to by}} their names. Buses are numbered in blocks of 10, corresponding to the nearest train line, with the 40s and 50s reserved for <b>express</b> <b>services</b> along the 407 ETR corridor which {{does not have a}} corresponding train line.|$|E
5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible <b>express</b> <b>services</b> on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
5|$|The {{generally}} conservative GWR {{made other}} {{improvements in the}} years before the World War I such as restaurant cars, better conditions for third class passengers, steam heating of trains, and faster <b>express</b> <b>services.</b> These were largely at the initiative of T. I. Allen, the Superintendent of the Line and {{one of a group of}} talented senior managers who led the railway into the Edwardian era: Viscount Emlyn (Earl Cawdor, Chairman from 1895 to 1905); Sir Joseph Wilkinson (general manager from 1896 to 1903), his successor, the former chief engineer Sir James Inglis; and George Jackson Churchward (the Chief Mechanical Engineer). It was during this period that the GWR introduced road motor services as an alternative to building new lines in rural areas, and started using steam rail motors to bring cheaper operation to existing branch lines.|$|E
50|$|The lower-level express platforms, while {{built with}} the rest of the station, were only {{operated}} between 1968 and 1976 when <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was operated along the line.

50|$|Until March 2004, the Wing <b>Express</b> limited <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was {{introduced}} to complement the Narita Express with one return working a day between Ōmiya/Ikebukuro/Shinjuku and Narita Airport. This service was subsequently replaced by an additional Narita <b>Express</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kamoshika {{name was}} revived from March 1997 as a limited <b>express</b> <b>service</b> {{operating}} between Akita and Aomori, replacing the former Tazawa limited <b>express</b> <b>service</b> which ran between Morioka and Aomori via Akita before the Akita Shinkansen was opened.|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} <b>express</b> <b>services</b> {{were often}} given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards {{carried on the}} locomotive, and on roofboards above {{the windows of the}} carriages. For instance, the late-morning Flying Dutchman express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Ledger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as The Zulu. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} named Raastad, and opened {{as part of}} the Vestfold Line on 7December 1881. It was located in the former municipality of Sandar, that was also served by Jåstad Station. Raastad was equipped with a wooden station building designed by Balthazar Lange, and cargo expedition. There was initially only one track, but on 1July 1910, a passing loop was installed at the station, allowing trains to pass. The station was renamed Råstad in April 1921. In 1969–70 the passing loop was extended, but already on 15September 1971 it was disabled, and subsequently removed, with the automation of the signaling. The station became unmanned on 1October 1971 and was closed on 28May 1978. The following day, the new InterCity <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> started on the Vestfold Line.|$|E
5|$|The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Coronation Class is a {{class of}} express {{passenger}} steam locomotives designed by William Stanier. They were an enlarged and improved version of his previous design, the LMS Princess Royal Class. The locomotives were specifically designed for power as {{it was intended to}} use them on <b>express</b> <b>services</b> between London Euston and Glasgow Central; their duties were to include the hauling of a proposed non-stop express, subsequently named the Coronation Scot. The first ten locomotives of the Coronation class were built in a streamlined form in 1937 by the addition of a steel streamlined casing. Five of these ten were specifically set aside to pull the Coronation Scot. Although a later batch of five unstreamlined locomotives was produced in 1938, most of the ensuing Coronation class were outshopped as streamliners. Eventually, from 1944 to 1949, all new engines would be built in unstreamlined form and all the streamliners would have their casings removed. The very last of the 38 locomotives was completed in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Beginning October 14, 1946, weekday {{rush and}} Saturday morning rush peak {{direction}} <b>express</b> <b>service</b> started, with Pelham Bay trains using the middle track between East 177th Street and Third Avenue – 138th Street. This <b>express</b> <b>service</b> saved eight minutes between Third Avenue and East 177th Street. During this time, 6 trains that ran local in the Bronx when express trains operated began to terminate at East 177 Street {{to make room}} for express trains to Pelham Bay Park. On March 7, 1949, the hours of the PM Bronx-bound <b>express</b> <b>service</b> were advanced from 4:30 PM to 3:30 PM, and on June 17, 1949, the hours of the AM Manhattan-bound <b>express</b> <b>service</b> were extended from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM.|$|R

5000|$|However, the F <b>express</b> <b>service</b> {{along the}} Culver Line was contested {{for four years}} by some {{residents}} living along the line, who feared that they {{would no longer have}} a one-seat ride into Manhattan.
