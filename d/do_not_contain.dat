5|$|Funerary art is {{any work}} of art forming, or placed in, a {{repository}} for {{the remains of the}} dead.

5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> {{references to the}} work of other directors, but do include a myriad of references to his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E
5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 {{rely on the}} Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 âˆ’ 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall.

5|$|Once {{regarded}} as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells {{of animals and}} other eukaryotes, bacterial cells <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.|$|E

An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The {{contents}} of a storage unit are put up for auction if the rental fees are not paid for sixty days. Although the TV show Storage Wars created increased interest in the auctions, most units <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> anything of substantial economic value. Sometimes auctioning the renter's property can result in disputes between Public Storage and the renter. In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

5|$|Balcer and Wolf {{conceived}} Law & Order: Criminal Intent as {{a police}} procedural crime drama that follows a distinct division of the New York City Police Department: the 'Major Case Squad', and its investigations in to high-profile murder cases, such as those involving VIPs, local government officials and employees, and people working in the financial industry and the arts and entertainment world. Unlike the other series in the Law & Order franchise, Law & Order: Criminal Intent gives significant attention to the actions and motives of the criminals, rather than primarily focusing on the police investigation and trial prosecution. Episodes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> trials, and end in confessions rather than plea bargains or verdicts.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E

5|$|The early texts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some {{argue that}} a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
