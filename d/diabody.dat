50|$|Divalent (or bivalent) {{single-chain}} variable fragments (di-scFvs, bi-scFvs) can be {{engineered by}} linking two scFvs. This {{can be done}} by producing a single peptide chain with two VH and two VL regions, yielding tandem scFvs. Another possibility is the creation of scFvs with linker peptides that are too short for the two variable regions to fold together (about five amino acids), forcing scFvs to dimerize. This type is known as diabodies. Diabodies have been shown to have dissociation constants up to 40-fold lower than corresponding scFvs, meaning that they have a much higher affinity to their target. Consequently, <b>diabody</b> drugs could be dosed much lower than other therapeutic antibodies and are capable of highly specific targeting of tumors in vivo. Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) lead to the formation of trimers, so-called triabodies or tribodies. Tetrabodies have also been produced. They exhibit an even higher affinity to their targets than diabodies.|$|E

40|$|Most cell-surface receptors for cytokines {{and growth}} factors signal as dimers, {{but it is}} unclear whether {{remodeling}} receptor dimer topology is a viable strategy to "tune" signaling output. We utilized <b>diabodies</b> (DA) as surrogate ligands in a prototypical dimeric receptor-ligand system, the cytokine Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EpoR), to dimerize EpoR ectodomains in non-native architectures. Diabody-induced signaling amplitudes varied from full to minimal agonism, and structures of these DA/EpoR complexes differed in EpoR dimer orientation and proximity. <b>Diabodies</b> also elicited biased or differential activation of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles compared to EPO. Non-signaling <b>diabodies</b> inhibited proliferation of erythroid precursors from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm due to a constitutively active JAK 2 V 617 F mutation. Thus, intracellular oncogenic mutations causing ligand-independent receptor activation can be counteracted by extracellular ligands that re-orient receptors into inactive dimer topologies. This approach has broad applications for tuning signaling output for many dimeric receptor systems...|$|R
3000|$|... 99 mTc is an {{attractive}} choice for labelling intermediate-sized recombinant proteins such as <b>diabodies</b> for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), for several reasons. First, the tricarbonyl chemistry allows direct chelation of 99 mTc by genetically encoded tags, such as the (His) 6 -tag, which simplifies the labelling process [27]. Second, its half-life of 6  h matches well with the average serum half-life of <b>diabodies.</b> Third, it provides excellent image quality at low radiation doses compared to isotopes with a longer half-life such as 111 In and 89 Zr that are needed for imaging with whole antibodies.|$|R

However, humanization resulted in 5 -fold loss of apparent affinity {{relative to the}} parental mAb (1 nM). In this study, <b>diabodies</b> (scFv dimers of 55 kDa) were generated from 2 B 3 including variants with different linker lengths as well as back-mutations to original murine residues to improve affinity. Parental 2 B 3 (p 2 B 3) and back-mutated 2 B 3 (bm 2 B 3) <b>diabodies</b> (Dbs) with five- or eight-amino acid linkers (p 2 B 3 -Db 5, p 2 B 3 -Db 8, bm 2 B 3 -Db 5 and bm 2 B 3 -Db 8) were evaluated for binding to PSCA by flow cytometry and affinities were determined by surface plasmon resonance. Back-mutation restored the affinity from 5. 4 to 1. 9 nM. Stability, evaluated by size exclusion, revealed that <b>diabodies</b> with eight-residue linkers existed as a mixture of dimeric and monomeric species at low concentrations (≤ 1 mg/ml).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to generate prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ×CD 3 diabodies as a novel treatment option for this tumor. METHODS: A PSMA×CD 3 <b>diabody</b> and a covalently linked single-chain <b>diabody</b> were constructed from the anti-PSMA single-chain Fv fragment D 7 and an anti-CD 3 single-chain Fv fragment. The fusion proteins were periplasmatically expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding properties were tested on PSMA-expressing C 4 - 2 {{prostate cancer}} cells and CD 3 + Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell viability assay was used. T-cell activation was determined by flow cytometry. In vivo activity of the <b>diabody</b> was tested in SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C 4 - 2 tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Bacterial expression levels were significantly higher for the <b>diabody</b> (1 - 1. 5 mg/l culture) compared with the single-chain <b>diabody</b> (0. 2 - 0. 4 mg/l culture). Specific binding on CD 3 -expressing Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C 4 - 2 cells was shown with both <b>diabody</b> formats. In vitro, both diabodies proved to be potent agents for retargeting human CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes to lyse C 4 - 2 prostate cancer cells. The formation of conjugates between T cells and target cells with clustering of the <b>diabody</b> at sites of interaction could be shown. SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C 4 - 2 tumor xenografts with the <b>diabody</b> showed an efficient inhibition of tumor growth.

40|$|Recently, we have {{described}} a bispecific PSMA x CD 3 <b>diabody</b> with one binding {{site for the}} T-cell antigen receptor (TCR-CD 3) and another for the Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). It effectively eliminates human prostate cancer cells by redirecting T-lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that activation of the T-cells and killing of the tumor cells, only occurred when the T-cells were coincubated with PSMA-positive tumor cells and the PSMA x CD 3 <b>diabody.</b> Both CD 4 + and CD 8 + human T-lymphocytes were activated. Surprisingly, they were equally potent in their cytotoxic activity, proliferation, and up-regulation of activation markers. Both, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T-cells mainly used the perforin-granzyme- based pathway and to a somewhat lesser extent the FasL pathway to lyse tumor cells. When Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with the <b>diabody</b> alone, the TCR-CD 3 was not triggered. In contrast, when the <b>diabody</b> was clustered with a secondary antibody the TCR-CD 3 was stimulated as detected by Ca 2 + -influx and Erk, IκB, and linker of activated T-cell phosphorylation. Clustering of the <b>diabody</b> could also be achieved by the dimeric PSMA antigen expressed on tumor cells.

40|$|Thrombin activatable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) {{are important}} regulators of fibrinolysis. Bothproteins attenuate the {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (tPA) -mediatedconversion of plasminogen into fibrin-degrading plasmin, however with distinct modes of action. Activated TAFI (TAFIa) removes C-terminal lysines from the fibrin surface, rendering fibrin less susceptible to fibrinolysis. PAI- 1 neutralises tPA by forming a covalent complex and is considered as the main inhibitor of tPA. Elevated levels of TAFI and PAI- 1 arelinked to an increased risk for thrombosis. There is an unmet clinical need to improve thrombolytic treatment, especially in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The only drugs available for thrombolysis comprise plasminogen activators. However, plasminogen activators remain underutilised owing to significant drawbacks, e. g. a low recanalising rate, high bleeding risk and possible neurotoxicity. Therefore, we embarked on a novel thrombolytic strategy: dual targeting of TAFI and PAI- 1 to effectively enhance endogenous fibrinolysis. In a previous study, a first heterodimer <b>diabody</b> against human TAFI and human PAI- 1 was generated that exhibited a strong profibrinolytic capacity in lysing experimental human thrombi. A heterodimer <b>diabody</b> is a recombinant antibody derivative with dualspecificity and {{was used in this}} study to circumvent complications associated with the administration of two different inhibitors. In the present study, we evaluated the application of dual TAFI/PAI- 1 inhibition through a <b>diabody</b> in vivo. In chapter 2, a recombinant bispecific <b>diabody</b> was generated from MA-RT 36 A 3 F 5 directed towards rat TAFI (with cross-reactivity to mouse, but not human TAFI) and MA- 33 H 1 F 7 directed towards human PAI- 1 (with cross-reactivity to mouse and rat PAI- 1). MA-RT 36 A 3 F 5 inhibits TAFI by destabilising TAFIa. MA- 33 H 1 F 7 converts active PAI- 1 to a substrate of tPA resulting in the inactivation of PAI- 1. Although the <b>diabody</b> was successfully expressed in bacteria and it preserved the inhibitory properties of the parental antibodies, the profibrinolytic effect was transient because of its low plasma stability. Through antibody engineering (e. g. CDR-grafting and linker addition), we obtained a stabilised version of this <b>diabody</b> with comparable profibrinolytic properties as those of the parental antibodies. Inchapter 3, a second candidate <b>diabody</b> was generated from MA-TCK 26 D 6, directed towards a stable variant of human TAFI, and MA- 33 H 1 F 7, also used in the previous <b>diabody,</b> against PAI- 1. MA-TCK 26 D 6 is a first-in-class antibody to have cross-reactivity towards human and rodent TAFI. A great asset of the corresponding <b>diabody,</b> Db-TCK 26 D 6 x 33 H 1 F 7, is that it can beevaluated in both preclinical as clinical settings. The <b>diabody</b> retained the functional properties of the parental antibodies and did not encounter stability issues. This resulted in a strong profibrinolytic effect in vitro which exceeded that of the combination of parental antibodies. Moreover, the <b>diabody</b> did not impair the beneficial anti-inflammatory properties of TAFIa. Therefore, Db-TCK 26 D 6 x 33 H 1 F 7 was selected for furtherevaluation in vivo. In chapter 4, the profibrinolytic properties of the parental antibodies or corresponding <b>diabody</b> (Db-TCK 26 D 6 x 33 H 1 F 7) were first assessed in a mouse model of thromboembolism evoked bysystemic administration of tissue factor. Whereas the antibodies, administered separately or combined, caused a half-maximal clearance of fibrin from the lungs, the <b>diabody,</b> administered at a corresponding dose, resulted in a maximal effect. In a model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, whereas the administration of a single parental antibody at a certain dose caused no effect, the administration of the combination of antibodiesor the <b>diabody</b> resulted in a complementary effect in mitigating ischemia/reperfusion injury (reduced lesion volumes and improved neurological and motor outcomes). The <b>diabody</b> was slightly more effective than the combination of antibodies in improving functional outcome. The superior profibrinolytic capacity of the <b>diabody</b> is most likely ascribed to its relatively small (58 kDa) and flexible structure. In chapter 5, the thrombolytic capacity of Db-TCK 26 D 6 x 33 H 1 F 7 was assessed by administering the <b>diabody</b> post thrombus formation in two types of thrombosis-induced stroke models. The effect of the <b>diabody</b> was compared to thatof tPA, the current treatment of AIS. In the thrombin-induced model, fibrin-rich clots are produced which are susceptible to tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. 24 hours post stroke onset, <b>diabody</b> administration caused a substantial reduction in lesion sizes which exceeded the effect of tPA administration. In the FeCl(3) -induced model, platelet-rich clots are produced which are resistant to tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. 24 hours post stroke onset, whereas tPA was non-effective, the <b>diabody</b> recanalised the artery, improved brain perfusion and reduced lesion sizes. Moreover, in contrast to tPA, the <b>diabody</b> did not prolong bleeding times. Inconclusion, this study clearly demonstrates the strong profibrinolytic properties of a dual targeting strategy against two antifibrinolytic proteins, TAFI and PAI- 1, in vivo. The two main findings of this study are that (i) dual targeting of TAFI and PAI- 1 is more effective with a <b>diabody</b> than with the combined use of parental antibodies and (ii) the <b>diabody</b> is more effective and potentially safer than tPA in the treatment of experimental stroke. nrpages: 140 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Bispecific {{antibodies}} {{have been}} exploited both as cancer immunodiagnostics and as cancer therapeutics, and have shown promise in several clinical trials in cancer imaging and therapy. A number of bispecific antibodies against B-cell markers {{have been shown}} to be effective in vitro in mediating tumor cell lysis and in vivo in inhibiting tumor growth in animal models. We have constructed a bispecific <b>diabody</b> from the variable genes encoding two hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD 20 on B cells and CD 3 on T cells. The anti-CD 20 x anti-CD 3 <b>diabody</b> was expressed in a single Escherichia coli host and purified by a one-step affinity chromatography. The bispecific <b>diabody</b> bound as efficiently to both CD 20 - and CD 3 -positive cells as the respective parental antibodies, and was capable of cross-linking CD 20 -positive tumor cells and human T lymphocytes as shown by cellular rosetting. The <b>diabody</b> effectively lysed human B-lymphoma cells in the presence of T-enriched human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Further, when combined with human PBL and interleukin- 2, the <b>diabody</b> significantly prolonged the survival of nude mice inoculated with human B-lymphoma cells. Taken together, our results suggest that an anti-CD 20 X anti-CD 3 <b>diabody</b> may have significant clinical application in the treatment of human CD 20 -positive B-cell malignancies.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported the utility for cancer immunotherapy of a humanized bispecific <b>diabody</b> (hEx 3) that targets {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor and CD 3. Here, we used dynamic and static light scattering measurements {{to show that the}} multimer fraction observed in hEx 3 in solution is a monodisperse tetramer. The multimerization into tetramers increased the inhibition of cancer cell growth by the hEx 3 <b>diabody.</b> Furthermore, 1 : 2 stoichiometric binding for both antigens was observed in a thermodynamic analysis, indicating that the tetramer has bivalent binding activity for each target, and the structure may be in a circular configuration, as is the case for the single-chain Fv tetrabody. In addition to enhanced cytotoxicity, the functional affinity and stability of the hEx 3 tetrabody were superior to those of the hEx 3 <b>diabody.</b> The increase in molecular weight is also expected to improve the pharmacokinetics of the bispecific <b>diabody,</b> making the hEx 3 tetrabody attractive as a therapeutic antibody fragment for cancer immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} of dimeric and trimeric {{single chain}} antibody Fv fragments (scFvs) complexed with anti-idiotype Fab fragments {{was used to}} reveal the orientation of antigen binding sites. This is the first structural analysis that discloses the multivalent binding orientation of scFv trimers (triabodies). Three different scFv molecules {{were used for the}} imaging analysis; NC 10 scFv- 5 and scFv- 0, with five- and zero-residue linkers respectively between the VH and VL domains, were complexed with 3 - 2 G 12 anti-idiotype Fab fragments and 11 - 1 G 10 scFv- 0 was complexed with NC 41 anti-idiotype Fab fragments. The scFv- 5 molecules formed bivalent dimers (<b>diabodies)</b> and the zero-linker scFv- 0 molecules formed trivalent trimers (triabodies). The images of the NC 10 diabody-Fab complex appear as boomerangs, not as a linear molecule, with a variable angle between the two Fab arms and the triabody-Fab complexes appear as tripods...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{single chain}} Fv {{fragment}} (scFv) of the murine monoclonal antibody 11 - 1 G 10 was constructed by directly joining the C-terminal residue of the VH domain to the N-terminal residue of VL. 11 - 1 G 10 is an anti-idiotype and competes with the antigen, influenza virus neuraminidase (NA), for binding to the NC 41 antibody. The scFv formed stable trimers with three active antigen combining sites for NC 41 Fab fragments. We propose that trimeric scFvs {{may be the}} preferred conformation for directly linked VH-VL molecules, which contrasts the formation of scFv dimers (<b>diabodies)</b> when the VH and VL domains are joined by short flexible linkers of between 5 – 10 residues. BIAcore biosensor binding experiments showed that the trimeric scFv showed an expected increase in binding affinity, due to avidity, compared to the monomeric 15 -residue linked scFv. The increase in avidity of scFv trimers offers advantages for imaging and immunotherapy...|$|R
30|$|Overall, this {{proof-of-concept}} {{study is}} quite unique {{as it has}} coupled PSMA-based SPECT/CT images {{to the growth of}} DPC- 1 prostatic tumors and metastases both local and distant, then histopathologically confirmed and showed to express the targeted PSMA/antigen in a time-wise manner resembling the natural history of prostate cancer. PSMA-based studies are primarily performed on heterotopic xenografts in rodents bearing a relatively low tumor volume [36] compared to canines. This is particularly attractive as, in contrast to most mammalian species, canines spontaneously develop prostate cancer although at a low incidence rate with ageing [20, 29, 37]. Unfortunately, the cancer is generally advanced at diagnosis and has reached the terminal stage [28 – 30]. The DPC- 1 preclinical model would prove to be most advantageous to enhance resolution or track down very small lesions using newly developed radiopharmaceuticals (<b>diabodies,</b> minibodies, small molecule inhibitors), imaging tools (PET/CT, PET/MRI vs. SPECT/CT), etc. It may find substantial utility to test new drugs or therapeutic modalities to destroy a high tumor/metastasis load not achievable in small rodent models. Finally, the use of equipment from the clinical setting in large size animals is attractive and could accelerate applicability of new devices prior moving to patients and impact on disease from time of early diagnosis to late stages.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using tobacco for {{production of a}} recombinant antibody (T 84. 66 /GS 8 <b>diabody)</b> directed against the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and used for tumor imaging was investigated. Two constructs were generated for targeting the protein either to the apoplast or to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of the <b>diabody</b> in tobacco leaves after vacuum-assisted infiltration of engineered Agrobacteria (agro-infiltration) and in regenerated transgenic tobacco plants was analyzed and compared. Results in terms of protein expression and accumulation between both systems showed a good correlation. His 6 -tagged T 84. 66 <b>diabody</b> was readily purified from agro-infiltrated tobacco leaves and from transgenic plants by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, gel filtration, electrospray mass spectrometry, direct and competition ELISA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and staining of CEA-positive colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS 174 T. Our results demonstrate that tobacco is a competent production system for this clinically relevant <b>diabody...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{cancer of}} the {{prostate}} {{is one of the}} most commonly diagnosed cancers in men, no curative treatment currently exists after its progression beyond resectable boundaries. Therefore, new agents for targeted treatment strategies are needed. Cross-linking of tumor antigens with T-cell associated antigens by bispecific monoclonal antibodies have been shown to increase antigen-specific cytotoxicity in T-cells. Since the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents an excellent tumor target, immunotherapy with bispecific diabodies could be a promising novel treatment option for prostate cancer. METHODS: A heterodimeric <b>diabody</b> specific for human PSMA and the T-cell antigen CD 3 was constructed from the DNA of anti-CD 3 and anti-PSMA single chain Fv fragments (scFv). It was expressed in E. coli using a vector containing a bicistronic operon for co-secretion of the hybrid scFv V H CD 3 -V L PSMA and V H PSMA-V L CD 3. The resulting PSMAxCD 3 <b>diabody</b> was purified from the periplasmic extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The binding properties were tested on PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells and PSMA-negative cell lines as well as on Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell viability test (WST) was used. For in vivo evaluation the <b>diabody</b> was applied together with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in a C 4 - 2 xenograft-SCID mouse model. RESULTS: By Blue Native gel electrophoresis, it could be shown that the PSMAxCD 3 <b>diabody</b> is mainly a tetramer. Specific binding both to CD 3 -expressing Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C 4 - 2 cells was shown by flow cytometry. In vitro, the <b>diabody</b> proved to be a potent agent for retargeting PBL to lyze C 4 - 2 prostate cancer cells. Treatment of SCID mice inoculated with C 4 - 2 tumor xenografts with the <b>diabody</b> and PBL efficiently inhibited tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: The PSMAxCD 3 <b>diabody</b> bears the potential for facilitating immunotherapy of prostate cancer and for the elimination of minimal residual disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of tumor tissue biomarkers {{has led to}} the production, validation, and Food and Drug Administration-approval of a number of antibody-based targeted therapeutics in the past two decades. As a result of the significant role that these immunotherapeutics play in the management of cancer, and the potential utility of complementary imaging agents, immunoPET imaging has generated considerable interest. This update discusses the important factors to consider when designing a PET (positron emission tomography) imaging agent from the molecular target to the biological targeting molecule and radionuclide combination and also reviews recent preclinical and clinical findings in the immunoPET field. Although {{there are a variety of}} radionuclides that are currently utilized in PET studies, this update focuses on four of the positron emitters commonly used in labeling proteins: iodine- 124, zirconium- 89, copper- 64, and fluorine- 18. Notable advances in the preclinical setting include the continued development of immunoPET probes to predict the biodistribution of related radioimmunotherapeutics, the success of nontraditional radionuclide and antibody fragment combinations, the broader use of zirconium- 89, and the recent emergence of 18 F-labeled <b>diabodies</b> for same-day imaging. Antibody-based PET probes constitute a valuable class of molecular imaging agents, and the progress made preclinically should expedite the transition of these targeted diagnostics to clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{therapeutics}} {{are playing}} an expanding role in modern medicinal chemistry. Among them, native or engineered molecules exploiting the binding and catalytic {{potential of the}} immune repertoire form an extremely exciting and emerging business area. They represent by far the single largest category of biopharmaceutical substances under investigation. The fast increase of this pharmaceutical category paralleled the scientific and technical progress from murine to chimeric, humanized and, finally, human engineered antibodies. Indeed, {{the development of the}} phage display technology, allowing libraries of shuffled murine or human antibody binding domains to be screened for affinity against a selected target antigen or activity against a specific reaction substrate, open new perspectives, disclosing the opportunity to circumvent restrictions inherent to the in vivo immunisation. Transgenic technology represents another powerful method for generating fully human monoclonal antibodies against a wide variety of drug targets, while recombinant technology continues to evolve, improving the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of antibody therapeutics, with the production of different antibody constructs or formats, such as bispecific antibodies, <b>diabodies</b> and others, and different functional activities, such as catalysis, cellular internalisation and antigen-mimicking. The aim of the present review is to overview native or recombinant antibodies while discussing the underlying antibody technology, with the aim to favour understanding of the antibody therapeutics that are in use or will enter market in the near future...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Engineered {{antibody}} fragments offer faster delivery with retained tumor specificity {{and rapid}} clearance from nontumor tissues. Here, we demonstrate that {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) based detection of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in prostatic tumor models using engineered bivalent antibodies built on single chain fragments (scFv) derived from the intact antibody, huJ 591, offers similar tumor delineating properties but with the advantage of rapid targeting and imaging. 89 Zr-radiolabeled huJ 591 scFv (dimeric scFv-CH 3; 89 Zr-Mb) and cysteine <b>diabodies</b> (dimeric scFv; 89 Zr-Cys-Db) demonstrated internalization and similar Kds (∼ 2 nM) compared to 89 Zr-huJ 591 in PSMA(+) cells. Tissue distribution assays established the specificities of both 89 Zr-Mb and 89 Zr-Cys-Db for PSMA(+) xenografts (6. 2 ± 2. 5 % ID/g and 10. 2 ± 3. 4 % ID/g at 12 h p. i. respectively), while minimal accumulation in PSMA(−) tumors was observed. From the PET images, 89 Zr-Mb and 89 Zr-Cys-Db exhibited faster blood clearance than the parent huJ 591 while tumor-to-muscle ratios for all probes show comparable values across all time points. Ex vivo autoradiography and histology assessed {{the distribution of the}} probes within the tumor. Imaging PSMA-expressing prostate tumors with smaller antibody fragments offers rapid tumor accumulation and accelerated clearance; hence, shortened wait periods between tracer administration and high-contrast tumor imaging and lower dose-related toxicity are potentially realized...|$|R
