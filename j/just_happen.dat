5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E

Upon arriving, Ozma takes charge and has Dorothy, Billina and Tik-Tok released from Langwidere's custody. Cheerful reunions ensue with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion, and new introductions are made to Ozma and the Hungry Tiger, a massive tiger who desires to eat fat babies, but is prevented from doing so by his conscience.|$|E
25|$|Teitur {{recorded}} his next album, Let the Dog Drive Home, in early 2010 in Copenhagen, {{with some of}} his regular musicians and collaborators, arranger Tróndur Bogason, drummer Derek Murphy (Atlanta, Georgia), bass player Mikael Blak (Faroe Islands), and Nikolaj Torp Larsen (London), and a host of guest musicians, and backing singers. Teitur once again produced the album, which was recorded and engineered by his regular cohort Jonas Bloch Danielsen and mixed by George Tandero (Norway) who also recorded and mixed Stay Under the Stars. The song title that spawned the album title is a metaphor for relaxing and letting things <b>just</b> <b>happen.</b> The artwork for the album, is based on a series of drawings by Teitur of a dog character, reflecting some of the lyrics in the album; the graphic design being handled, as on all his albums, by London-based Bob McKie with direction by Christian Ulf-Hansen.|$|E

Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film four out of four stars. Writing in the Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan wrote, [...] "The Thin Red Line is a movie about creation growing out of destruction, about love where you'd least expect to find it and about angels – especially the fallen kind – who <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to be men".|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, Seeley and Norton said major {{networks}} had approached them about developing a Revival television series, and later mentioned NBC specifically. Around this same time, ABC Studios {{was involved in}} a bidding war for the rights to The Returned, an unpublished novel by Jason Mott that dealt with similar themes. ABC announced they were moving forward with The Returned in January 2013, although it was later retitled Resurrection. Although some fans suspected Seeley and Norton's idea had been stolen, Seeley said [...] "these things <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> sometimes". He said the announcement was [...] "unfortunate" [...] because they had been working with talented people to adapt Revival. However, the television developments would have limited Seeley and Norton's creative input.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{living in}} the countryside, Persona 4 {{characters}} were designed to look and sound [...] "normal" [...] and like [...] "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being [...] "more rural than was really called for". [...] "The characters aren't really ... They <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> {{to live in a}} place that's not a major metropolitan area." [...] While interviewing members of Persona 4s development team, 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have [...] "more stylish" [...] hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country. [...] "With Yosuke in particular, I gave him accessories, such as headphones and a bicycle, to make it more obvious that he was from the city." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{as someone who}} is not afraid of expressing her sexuality, and as a flawed human being who takes charge of her own life. Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{and after}} the final debate, McCain {{compared}} Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] {{as a symbol of}} American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency. McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to have disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics. [...] Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.|$|E

500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E
500|$|Underoath's {{members are}} Christian and {{have stated that}} they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, [...] " [...] in a {{different}} way. We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
500|$|While in Europe, Spears {{met with}} William Orbit and Daft Punk about {{possible}} collaborations, and originally confirmed Darkchild and The Neptunes as producers. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter {{about the direction}} of the record, Spears responded it was an organic evolution, adding, [...] "It should <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> naturally from the way you feel. [...] Whatever happens, happens". Additionally, Spears scheduled meet-and-greets with Timbaland and Missy Elliott in an effort to help evolve her sound. Elliott would also enlist in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears' project, however none of the initial material saw the light of day. Fred Durst was asked by Spears' management to submit material, and he wrote and produced three trip hop tracks that were recorded by Spears in January 2003. However, after news of an affair between them broke, Durst told Jive Records {{he was not going to}} let them use the songs for the album. In March 2003, Lauren Christy from The Matrix spoke about the development of the album with MTV News, and likened their work with Spears to Madonna's 1998 album Ray of Light.

500|$|By default, Aurora {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the film's main character. Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of [...] "protagonist" [...] rightfully belongs to the three good fairies because they [...] "make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action", while Aurora acts {{as little more than a}} pawn. Butler expounded that Aurora [...] "never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesn’t act; she is acted upon. So she is definitely not the hero of the story." [...] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, [...] "Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion." [...] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as [...] "the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome." [...] However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: [...] "Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, it’s not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> which we have no control over, a difficult but important lesson." [...] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beautys title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely. Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has [...] "thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions," [...] elaborating, [...] "While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events so we get to see a more authentic everyday side of her." [...] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors [...] "precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies." ...|$|E
