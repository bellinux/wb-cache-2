5|$|Jaime and Mace Tyrell lead {{a company}} of Tyrell {{soldiers}} {{through the streets of}} King's Landing to the Great Sept of Baelor, where the High Sparrow is presenting Margaery to the people of King's Landing. Jaime orders the High Sparrow to release Margaery and her brother Loras, threatening force against the Faith Militant. The High Sparrow declares that Margaery will not have to perform a walk of atonement, and instead presents King Tommen, who has agreed to unite the Faith and the Crown. When Mace Tyrell asks his mother, Lady Olenna what this means, she bitterly replies <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> High Sparrow has won.|$|E

60|$|For myself, I do not {{understand}} what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>It</b> may <b>mean</b> one of two things. If <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> first, <b>it</b> is a term somewhat unnecessary, if not somewhat irreverent. If <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> second, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> something untrue and immoral.|$|R

25|$|There {{may also}} be a special class which absorbs early {{repayments}} in the underlying assets. This is often the case where the underlying assets are mortgages which, in essence, are repaid whenever the properties are sold. Since any early repayments are passed on to this class, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> other investors have a more predictable cash flow.|$|E

25|$|To cause gall formation, the T-DNA encodes {{genes for}} the {{production}} of auxin or indole-3-acetic acid via the IAM pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is not used in many plants {{for the production}} of auxin, so <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> plant has no molecular means of regulating it and auxin will be produced constitutively. Genes {{for the production of}} cytokinins are also expressed. This stimulates cell proliferation and gall formation.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not a}} {{question}} of an assault in the classic sense of the word. What does an assault on a city mean? <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> use of all the forces and weapons in the country's arsenal. It primarily means heavy rocket preparation lasting several hours. It means heavy bombing raids on the whole city with the aim of disabling 60% of the defenders and demoralizing the rest.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means anything at all, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E

25|$|Pollution {{control is}} a term used in {{environmental}} management. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique {{for the prevention of}} urban runoff.|$|E
25|$|Painting taken {{literally}} is {{the practice}} of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium) and a binding agent (a glue) to a surface (support) such as paper, canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> use of this activity in combination with drawing, composition and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting {{is also used to}} express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel to the human body itself.|$|E
25|$|During stealth {{missions}} {{the player}} can {{progress through the}} level using the Polyjuice Potion, Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder or the Invisibility Cloak. While manoeuvring under the Invisibility Cloak the player must move slowly to ensure the stealth meter, on the bottom right hand corner of the screen, does not turn red. If the meter has turned red <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> player {{is in danger of}} getting caught and must stay still until the meter has re-generated. When the player gets close enough to an enemy while under the Invisibility Cloak they are able to cast a stunning spell at them, or use the shield charm as a knock-out melee attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{matching}} {{complex of}} a graph {{consists of the}} sets of edges no two of which share an endpoint; again, this family of sets satisfies the no-Δ condition. It {{may be viewed as}} the clique complex of the complement graph of the line graph of the given graph. When the matching complex is referred to without any particular graph as context, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> matching complex of a complete graph. The matching complex of a complete bipartite graph K'm,n is known as a chessboard complex. It is the clique graph of the complement graph of a rook's graph, and each of its simplices represents a placement of rooks on an m'n chess board such that no two of the rooks attack each other. When m=n±1, the chessboard complex forms a pseudo-manifold.|$|E
25|$|The Chumphon {{route is}} {{unlikely}} {{to have been the}} main attack route as it was even farther south than Alaungpaya's Kuiburi route. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> Burmese would have had a longer route to go back up the Gulf of Siam coast. Without the element of surprise that Alaungpaya enjoyed in the 1760 war, the Burmese invasion force of 1765 would have had to fight more than three months it took Alaungpaya {{to break out of the}} coast. Yet, Maha Nawrahta's army was west of Ayutthaya by December. To be sure, the smaller Burmese army that took Tenasserim could have crossed over at Chumphon, and marched up the coast although the most southerly battles reported by the Burmese were at Ratburi and Phetburi, on the northern coast. At any rate, according to the Burmese sources, Chumphon was not the main attack route.|$|E
25|$|Taken together, {{proponents of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination {{of a large}} percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.|$|E

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

500|$|The Vedas {{mention the}} name Rishabha.
