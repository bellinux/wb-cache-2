We examine job-related social {{processes}} and outcomes in a randomized housing experiment in which “treated ” families relocated from public housing in high poverty, inner-city neighborhoods to privately run housing in low poverty ones. We test three hypotheses about <b>how</b> <b>exiting</b> the ghetto might affect employment—spatial mismatch, networks, and norms—with a unique, mixed method strategy. Combining qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldnotes, and survey {{data on the}} adults with census and administrative data on the changing geography of jobs, we conclude {{that the lack of}} generalized treatment effects for job-ready participants so far owes to: the challenges of securing jobs-housing-support matches where the markets are turbulent and informal social support is vital but unpredictable; and the challenges for parents of “converting ” new locations into new social and institutional resources while retaining pre-move resources, such as accessible childcare. Yet neighborhoods can matter (as locations) even where neighbors do not: “Successful ” relocation actually led to a loss of spatial access to entry-level job centers, new job creation, and net jo...|$|E

40|$|Today, large {{implementation}} projects introducing Enterprise System (ES) {{technology in}} organizations {{are a very}} common phenomenon, typically driven {{by the idea that}} a myriad of benefits can be realized. Yet, after implementation, organizations often face challenging problems due to misalignments between “best practices” embedded in ES technology and existing work practices. For the individual user implementation of new technology thus implies considerable effort in terms of cognitively accomplishing appropriation. This complex process of appropriation was found to result in very strong links between technology and individuals that is described as a sociomaterial entanglement by some scholars. In addition, ES technology implementations do often not ‘simply’ introduce a new technology into an organization, but will likely replace a similarly complex, integrated legacy system. Given the strong link between individuals and technology, established while appropriating the legacy system, replacing old technology will imply the breaking of old associations as much as the building of new ones. Consequently, the point of departure is as much characterized by an achieved sociomaterial entanglement with the old technology as it is by the need to integrate new technology into work practices. It has long been argued that organizational routines are key to understanding changes of work practices in organizations as well as the associated process of organizational learning. While the question how organizational routines emerge and evolve over time is extensively studied, little is known about what happens when routines are disrupted. In addition, the substitution of a legacy system raises the question, <b>how</b> <b>exiting</b> entanglements influence changes in routines triggered by ES technology implementation. Addressing this gap in the literature, this thesis aims to understand how sociomaterial routines are repaired after the implementation of ES technology. To answer this question, a longitudinal interpretive case study of an ES technology implementation project in the retail banking division of a large German bank was conducted. The custom-built legacy system to be replaced by new ES technology due to technical and regulatory requirements had been in place for over thirty years before. Within the retail banking division the study focuses on the credit service unit, which offers back-office services to the bank’s customers and advisors. The case material consists of 57 semi-structured interviews and observation of 38 participants, collected at three different stages during the project (before go-live, immediately after go-live, and 6 month later). Using narrative networks as an analytical device helped capturing the complexity of routine changes related to ES technology implementation and provided the conceptual link between organizational routines and sociomaterial entanglements. Based on a comparison of relevant routines at different points in time during (post-) implementation, five categories of practices individuals (in different positions/at different organizational levels) employed to repair routine performances were identified. Two of the practices aimed directly at adapting routines. But, individuals also developed additional support practices (i. e., work practices, which are performed in addition to, but share common fragments with, the supported routine). Two more repair practices targeted the sociomaterial background based on which routines are established, that is they changed the basis on which those actants are delineated, which are subsequently forming routine fragments. Thus, in line with other studies of post-implementation behavior, the findings show that repairing routines is a collaborative achievement of many, if not all, individuals directly and indirectly affected by the technological change. Yet, the repair practices employed at different levels do not operate independently, but are highly interrelated. Like researchers studying other phenomena using a sociomaterial lens, both physical (e. g., use of printouts) as well as digital (e. g., functionality of new ES technology) materiality were found to be important constituents of problems and repair practice. Furthermore, time was similarly important for repairing routines as both the timing of routine executions as well as the unfolding of repair practices over time had major effects on the final success of recreating routines. The findings also highlight that repair practices are different with respect to their persistence. While those practices employed to handle the situation of change were more likely to disappear again (yet did not necessarily do so), those required for adapting routines and accommodating the new system most likely persist. In conclusion, repairing routines after ES technology implementation does not only involve replacing one routine fragment (related to the old technology) with a new fragment (based on new technology) and appropriately reincorporating this new fragment into an otherwise stable routine. To the contrary, repairing routines implicates far more profound changes to routines, which have to be negotiated both with the social and material environment, and further requires adjusting the sociomaterial background based on which routines are established. In addition, repair practices evolve over time and differ with respect to their persistence. Thus, repairing a routine has a social, material, and temporal dimension, which jointly have to be considered. This doctoral thesis contributes to theory by providing a conceptual account of ES Transformation, which offers an explanation of how a working ES is reestablished by repairing routines after the implementation of ES technology. These findings are also valuable for practitioners as they allow them to better understand and consequently better plan and manage ES Transformations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: "Exits" in {{cognitive}} analytic therapy (CAT) are methods that change unhelpful patterns or roles {{during the final}} "revision" phase of the therapy. <b>How</b> <b>exits</b> are conceived and achieved is currently poorly understood. This study focussed on the revision stage to explore and define how change is accomplished in CAT. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis studied transcripts of sessions 6 and 7 of a protocol delivered 8 -session CAT treatment for depression. Eight participants met the study inclusion criteria, and therefore, 16 sessions were analysed. RESULTS: The exit model developed contained 3 distinct (but interacting) phases: (a) developing an observing self via therapist input or client self-reflection, (b) breaking out of old patterns by creating new roles and procedures, and (c) utilisation {{of a range of}} methods to support and maintain change. Levels of interrater reliability for the exit categories that formed the model were good. CONCLUSIONS: The revision stage of CAT emerged as a complex and dynamic process involving 3 interacting stages. Further research is recommended to understand <b>how</b> <b>exits</b> relate to durability of change and whether change processes differ according to presenting problem. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: Exit work {{in cognitive}} analytic therapy is a dynamic process that requires progression through stages of insight, active change, and consolidation.

This adapted framework generates concrete expectations about how increased mobility affects both internal and external conceptions of sovereignty. In particular, increased mobility is shown to improve the responsiveness of governments to citizen demands. Thus, in contrast to the general consensus that labor/voters benefit least from increased globalization, I suggest that the problem facing labor is not globalization, per se.

In this study, we present new empirical evidence on <b>how</b> <b>exit</b> exams influenced educational attainment and labor market experiences using data from the 2000 Census and the National Center for Education Statistics' Common Core of Data (CCD).

Similarly, our analysis of grade-level dropout data from the CCD indicates that Minnesota's recent exit exam increased the dropout rate in urban and high-poverty school districts as well as in those with a relatively large concentration of minority students. This increased risk of dropping out was concentrated among 12 th grade students. However, we also found that Minnesota's exit exam lowered the dropout rate in low-poverty and suburban school districts, particularly among students in the 10 th and 11 th grades. These results suggest that exit exams have the capacity to improve student and school performance but also appear to have exacerbated the inequality in educational attainment. ...|$|R

Given high entry and exit rates and the potential importance of turnover in accounting for aggregate productivity, in this paper we examine the determinants of plant exits and then examine <b>how</b> <b>exits</b> and other forms of output reallocation contribute to aggregate productivity. Using a unique plant-level longitudinal data set for Colombia for the period 1982 - 98, we examine the role of productivity and demand as well as input costs in determining plant exits. Moreover, given the important structural reforms introduced in Colombia during the early 1990 s, we explore whether and how plant survival changed after these reforms. Our data permit measurement of plant-level quantities and prices, which allows us to decompose productivity and demand shocks and, in turn, to estimate the effects of these fundamentals on plant exit. We find that higher productivity, higher demand, and lower input prices decrease the probability of plant exit. We also find that the importance of physical efficiency and costs in determining exits increases after the introduction of structural reforms. Finally, a decomposition of aggregate productivity suggests that reallocation through entry and exit is important in accounting for the increase in aggregate productivity after the introduction of structural reforms.

We also found large differences in these numbers across sex, age, racial, ethnic, and educational groups—differences that are much larger in some states than in others.

50|$|In {{comparison}} to competitive consumer markets, the employment relationship requires {{a different approach}} to power as managers have more authority than lower level employees (Hamilton and Feenstra 1997), leading to important implications for <b>how</b> <b>exit,</b> voice, and loyalty are treated within the employment context. For instance, in sharp contrast to Hirschman's (1970: 77) argument that, where exit is possible, voice is likely to be determined by ‘the extent to which customer-members are willing to trade off the certainty of exit against the uncertainties of an improvement in a deteriorated product’, within the context of employment, how willing employees are to trade off the uncertainties and costs of exit against the certainties of staying will strongly influence employees’ decisions to quit as well as to voice their opinions (Allen 2014). Similarly, loyalty and voice are not positively related in the employment context. In Hirschman's original formulation, consumers with higher levels of loyalty are more likely to voice their preferences to the selling organization rather than stop buying a product or service (exit). However, employees who voice their concerns may be seen as disloyal or as a disruptive influence by managers (Upchurch et al., 1996), leading loyal employees to remain silent. For this and other reasons, a concept of ‘neglect’ needs to supplement Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty framework within the employment context (Donaghey et al. 2011; Farrell 1983).|$|R
