Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E

At one point, Guiteau argued before Judge Cox that President Garfield was killed not by the bullets but by medical malpractice ("The doctors killed Garfield, I <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> him"). Throughout the trial and up until his execution, Guiteau was housed at St. Elizabeths Hospital in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. While in prison and awaiting execution, Guiteau wrote a defense of the assassination he had committed and an account of his own trial, which was published as The Truth and the Removal.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, visitors {{first saw}} the eastern side {{as they entered the}} altar area. Here was where almost all of the important Olympian gods were assembled. On the left the presentation begins with the three-faceted goddess Hecate. She fights in her three incarnations with a torch, a sword and a lance against the Giant Clytius. Next to her is Artemis, the goddess of the hunt; in keeping with her function she fights with a bow and arrow against a Giant who is perhaps Otos. Her hunting dog kills another Giant with a bite to the neck. Artemis’ mother Leto fights at her side using a torch against an animal-like Giant; at her other side her son and Artemis’ twin, Apollo, fights. Like his sister, he is armed with bow and arrow and has <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> the Giant Udaios, who lies at his feet.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Artillery Memorial {{has been}} the subject of much {{critical}} discussion since its inception. Upon its unveiling, several members of the RAWCF committee and others were displeased by the design and by the dead soldier in particular. Some felt that it was too graphic, or that it would be distressing to relatives and others who should have been consoled by the memorial, while a group of former artillerymen felt that any recumbent figure should be of a man <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> down so as to present a more heroic image. Charles ffoulkes, the inaugural curator of the Imperial War Museum was more impressed, describing the figure as [...] "a poignant and tremendous statement of fact which unconsciously makes the onlooker raise his hat".|$|E

[...] Summoned—pregnant—from bed around midnight by producer Jack Nitzsche, Clayton made her recording with just a few takes then returned home to bed.

He shared in his unit's first aerial victory on 8July 1940, and began scoring heavily against the Luftwaffe the following month.

We had no visual effects or attachment points on her guns so she <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> laser beams out of her eyes." [...] Overwatchs assistant game director Aaron Keller has said that Temple of Anubis was the first map developed for the game, and that the map and Tracer were worked on concurrently. Keller revealed: [...] "One day we got both of them in, and just with Tracer running around an unfinished map it was fun." [...] Keller also described how Tracer's three abilities were maintained throughout the game's development, as opposed to the game's other heroes, stating that, [...] "from the beginning, she originated as a 'whole' hero." [...] However, her health pool was nerfed during the game's late closed beta stages. On Tracer's gameplay style, Kotakus Kirk Hamilton commented, [...] "she's quick and squishy, designed more to harry the opposing team from behind than to survive a frontal assault".|$|E

His comrades left three particular enemy positions to his attention: a trench at 350 yards (320 m) from his post, a communication sap at 500 yards (457 m), and a track in a gully at 1,000 yards (914 m). According to Reed, [...] "Every time Billy Sing felt sorry for the poor Turks, he remembered how their snipers picked off the Australian officers {{in the early days of}} the landing, and he hardened his heart. But he never fired at a stretcher-bearer or any of the soldiers who were trying to rescue wounded Turks." [...] In contrast, Hamilton said in a 2008 interview, [...] "We have an anecdote where, after spotting an injured Turk, he said 'I'll put that poor cuss out of his agony' and <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> him.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} July 2006 in New York City. American Gangster was filmed {{over a period}} of approximately four months in over 180 different locations, most of them across New York; it set the record for containing the highest number of filming locations of a movie. Two months were spent in New York, with all the city's five boroughs being used. Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s. According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive location scouting was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at 116th Street 20 blocks north, on 136th Street. In his interview with ComingSoon.net, Scott stated that [...] " [...] just walked in [...] and [...] <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> in the house." [...] Several gas masks were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid gentrification in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles. Hand-held cameras were extensively used to depict a [...] "guerrilla filmmaking" [...] style.|$|E
500|$|Still at {{the bottom}} of the hill, 3 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Clive Williams—had <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> and killed two Viet Cong moving along the creek line. Reaching the top of the hill to the left of company headquarters, Williams turned to the right towards the Viet Cong positions. Moving into {{extended}} line on a [...] front the Australians had advanced just [...] before the left flank was engaged by a number of machine-guns from another sector of the Viet Cong position. In danger of being outflanked, 3 Platoon continued to advance regardless, using fire and movement. Just [...] from the bunkers Private Peter Gillson, the machine-gunner in the forward section, was shot as he tried to move around the twisted roots of a tall tree. As he fell two Viet Cong rushed forward to take the M60 machine-gun; however, Gillson was still conscious and they were killed at point blank range before he collapsed. Williams radioed Healy of the increasing danger while his platoon sergeant—Sergeant Colin Fawcett—had crawled forward under heavy fire to Gillson, whose body was wedged in the buttress of a large tree. Unable to find a pulse, Fawcett attempted to extract Gillson, but was unable to do so due to heavy fire. Two other attempts to recover the body were also beaten back, and although unsuccessful, Fawcett was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions.|$|E
500|$|... "Man Down" [...] is a reggae murder ballad with [...] "Caribbean-rhythms" [...] and {{elements}} of ragga and electronic music. The song, {{in the key}} of C minor, has a tempo of 77beats per minute. Rihanna's voice spans more than {{one and a half}} octaves, from F3 to E5. Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani described [...] "Man Down" [...] as one of Rihanna's [...] "most confident vocal performances" [...] with her strong Barbadian patois. Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that the singer [...] "plays up her West Indian accent", and August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the vocals as reasserting [...] "her Caribbean lilt". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt described [...] "Man Down" [...] as a song with [...] "island rhythms". Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, but later regrets it. Rihanna slowly relays the chain of events which led up to the murder. She cries to her mother about the act that she has committed– [...] "Mama, I <b>just</b> <b>shot</b> a man down"– expressing guilt and remorse for not meaning to kill her attacker, and that he is somebody's son. As the track develops, Rihanna's Bajan accent becomes stronger and exaggerated, which climaxes during the bridge as she declares [...] "Why deed I pull dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, BOOM!" [...] MuuMuse writer Bradley Stern thought that the track took on a confessional tone.|$|E
