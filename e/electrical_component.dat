25|$|A {{capacitor}} is {{a passive}} two-terminal <b>electrical</b> <b>component</b> that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The {{effect of a}} capacitor is known as capacitance. While capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors of a circuit in sufficiently close proximity, a capacitor is specifically designed to provide and enhance this effect {{for a variety of}} practical applications by consideration of size, shape, and positioning of closely spaced conductors, and the intervening dielectric material. A capacitor was therefore historically first known as an electric condenser.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] {{resistor}} is {{a passive}} two-terminal <b>electrical</b> <b>component</b> that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors {{are used to}} reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat {{may be used as}} part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the slope}} of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the curve. [...] Static {{resistance}} determines the power dissipation in an <b>electrical</b> <b>component.</b> [...] Points on the IV curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which {{the slope of}} the chordal line is negative, have negative static resistance. [...] Passive devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. [...] However active devices such as transistors or op-amps can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as gyrators.|$|E
2500|$|A memristor ( [...] ; a {{portmanteau}} {{of memory}} resistor) is a hypothetical non-linear passive two-terminal <b>electrical</b> <b>component</b> relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. [...] It was envisioned, and its name coined, in 1971 by circuit theorist Leon Chua. According to the characterizing mathematical relations, the memristor would hypothetically {{operate in the}} following way: The memristor's electrical resistance is not constant but depends {{on the history of}} current that had previously flowed through the device, i.e., its present resistance depends on how much electric charge has flowed in what direction through it in the past; the device remembers its history â€” the so-called non-volatility property. When the electric power supply is turned off, the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until it is turned on again.|$|E

An <b>electrical</b> <b>component</b> failure in the propulsion control system was blamed for the crash.

Legislation was introduced, with the last revision in 1994, to require plugs sold to meet the technical standard.

[...] The pressure group PlugSafe reported in March 2014 that since August 2011 [...] "thousands" [...] of listings of products including illegal plugs had been removed from the UK websites ebay.co.uk and amazon.co.uk. [...] The UK Electrical Safety Council expressed shock at the magnitude of the problem and published a video showing a plug exploding due to a counterfeit BS 1362 fuse.
