500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} other {{tradition}}s at FIU that are not spirit-related. The [...] "Kissing Bridge" [...] tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> kiss someone on the bridge you will stay with them forever. The top floor of Green Library {{is said to be}} haunted; students have reported a friendly ghost that wanders the halls minutes before the library closes at night. Another superstition is that if a student steps on the university seal engraved in front of the Graham Center and in the WUC at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the university's student union, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it (a variation based on superstitions from hundreds of universities nationwide).|$|E

500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't express yourself, if you don't {{say what you}} want, then you're {{not going to get}} it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Clinkscales often plays streetball {{with the}} Sean Bell All-Stars against local teams in New York City, {{acting as the}} {{starting}} point guard. The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. It seems like it never goes right {{when it comes to the}} law, but the message to the kids <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go hard on the court you have to go hard in the classroom." [...] In 2015, he competed for the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a team that featured Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was managed by Raheem Wiggins. In a victory against Team No Excuses in 2015, Clinkscales scored 11 points. As well as playing streetball, he coaches youth basketball in South Jamaica, Queens.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest {{has become}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it {{is used as a}} common topic for conversation in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan's national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that [...] "the common wisdom <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ask someone from Japan to draw 'Slime,' he'll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game." [...] With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida's Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool's Hoax, Google announced a [...] "NES version" [...] of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest.|$|E
500|$|VideoGamer.com {{called it}} [...] "the best of its platform" [...] and [...] "a {{great example of}} the genre", praising its [...] "excellent plot and puzzles", and saying it makes good use of the DS' screens. However, the {{magazine}} stated that fans may miss the spoken dialogue. Official Nintendo Magazine UK praised the Wii version's puzzles, story, and art direction, and complimented the new hint system, finishing with: [...] "One of the best point-and-click games ever, this will appeal to both newcomers and fans". Gaming and technology journalist James Woodcock said of the iPhone version: [...] "There {{are quite a few}} point and click adventures to choose from on the Apple iTunes Store and Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is one of the finer selections if not the best to give your heartfelt attentions to and best of all travels with you in your pocket." [...] He also praised its story, puzzles, writing and art direction. Slide to Play also complimented the iPad version, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: Director's Cut HD is a great game that nearly anyone can enjoy. Our one caveat <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> played through it on the iPhone, then the HD version probably doesn't offer enough new content to warrant another purchase. But if you're new to the game or you haven't played it in a while, this is the version to get. The iPad truly is the ideal platform for adventure games." [...] BeefJack praised the PC version's, puzzles, story, characters, new content and interface, but stated that audiovisual quality of older scenes is noticeably [...] "ropey", that there are too many sliding tile puzzles, and that [...] "the new jarring transition between old and new aesthetics lets it down." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason to}} suppose that people may deviate from the {{equilibrium}} behavior is if some are altruistic. The basic idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are playing against an altruist, that person will always cooperate, and hence, to maximize your payoff you should defect on the last round rather than the first. [...] If enough people are altruists, sacrificing the payoff of first-round defection is worth the price {{in order to determine}} whether or not your opponent is an altruist. Nagel and Tang (1998) suggest this explanation.|$|E
2500|$|Akram {{also held}} {{the record for}} the most wickets in Cricket World Cups, a total of 55 in 38 matches. Australia's Glenn McGrath broke the record during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ending with a final tally of 71 from 39 matches. On passing Wasim's record, McGrath said, [...] "Wasim Akram, to me, is one of the {{greatest}} bowlers of all time. Left-armer, swung it both ways with the new ball and he was so dangerous with the old ball. To go past him is something I will always remember. Probably the other side of the coin <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> play long enough, you're going to break records here and there." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} a general {{tolerance}} for religion, many African religions were not recognized because they typically revolved around belief in animism and magic, beliefs which were consistently met with scorn, and were regarded as immoral and subservient.

2500|$|Though it is {{intuitively}} {{clear what}} supervenience is, formally specifying {{what it means}} involves a complex technical apparatus and a family of related but subtly different definitions. Most definitions involve comparisons of objects for indiscernibility. According to one standard definition, a set of properties A (e.g. mental properties) supervenes {{on a set of}} properties B (e.g. neural properties), if and only if any two objects x and y which share all properties in B (are [...] "B-indiscernible") must also share all properties in A (are [...] "A-indiscernible"). The intuitive idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could make a physical copy of a person, you'd also be making a psychological copy of that person. The reverse does not hold; two people could be in the same mental state, but that mental state could be supported by different brain states (the same mental state could be [...] "multiply realizable" [...] by different brain states). The properties in B are called the base properties (or sometimes subjacent or subvenient properties), and the properties in A are called the supervenient properties.|$|E

Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you.

2500|$|In August 2011 Ash {{collaborated with}} We Are Scientists {{to release a}} cover of the song [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by British {{songwriter}} Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society. The song was recorded between London and New York by the two bands and join a project already boasting releases from Ed Hardcourt and Emmy the Great. Chris Cain from We Are Scientists {{said in an interview}} [...] "We actually recorded a single [...] which {{is going to come out}} soon. It won't be too long until it's out and it's for a charity in England called the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It's a cover of a song called [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by I think Happy Monster but it's pretty sweet. The concept of the song <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> listen to it on headphones or stereo the musicians of Ash are on the left channel and all the We Are Scientists guys are playing it in the right channel. We're playing the same song essentially but in different ways. I'm not playing the same bass line as Mark and Rick isn't playing the same drum pattern as Andy. I think Keith and Tim sing the same thing but in a different sort of harmony. What's interesting especially is that not only do we have a unison feel going on but you can also take off one headphone and hear one band and vice versa." ...|$|E
