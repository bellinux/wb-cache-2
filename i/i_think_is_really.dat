Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E
500|$|Burt {{is shown}} to have deeply loved his first wife, Kurt's mother, a strong woman who died eight {{years prior to the}} premiere of the show. He later characterizes his life after losing her as [...] "being asleep". Kurt {{introduces}} him to Carole Hudson, Finn's widowed mother, and they begin dating. He falls in love with her and she with him: he tells Finn that she is an [...] "angel who came down to wake me up after all these years". At Carole's behest, Burt becomes something of a father figure to Finn, taking him to ball games, though this development does not sit well with Kurt, who works to win his father's attention back from Finn by emulating his father's dress and interests before Burt realizes how hurt Kurt is. The relationship between Burt and Carole progresses {{to the point that they}} decide to live together, and she and Finn move in with the Hummels, since their house is the larger of the two. However, after Finn uses a homophobic slur against Kurt, Burt tells Finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in the house any more, imperiling his romance with Carole. Following his appearance in this episode, O'Malley spoke of future reconciliation between Burt and Finn. He stated, [...] "One of the things <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> important in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes. I'm hoping that Finn and Burt are able to cross that chasm." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E

[...] "Don't Let It Go to Your Head" [...] is also covered by [...] on their album Kiss and Tell (2008) and Jordin Sparks on her second album Battlefield (2009). Shortly after Sparks' album was released Dobson said, [...] "Jordin Sparks just did , which was on Sunday Love, which was very cool. She did kind of, like, a more R version of it, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> nice, actually. It was really cool that she didn't try and do a rock version of it, and she did what she's more comfortable with, which I thought was awesome." [...] The Sparks' version was released as a single in the UK on January 4, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{appreciated}} {{the fact the}} writers {{did not make a}} big deal of defining either characters' sexuality or their romantic relationship. Show creator Rothenberg said labels and gender are not a factor in the series, which Debnam-Carey viewed as true to the story. [...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make it out to be this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement," [...] she said. [...] "It is just that in this world, some things are a little better after the apocalypse [...] It kind of represents, in a way, an ideal place where people love people and it doesn't have to be a thing, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> great." ...|$|E

And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to recording, {{it was revealed}} later that month that Brown was in the studio working on the album with Asher Roth, Nas, Wiz Khalifa, will.i.am, and Kid Sister. On January 20, 2012, Brown announced that Nas will appear as a guest vocalist on the album. In an interview with MTV News, producer Harvey Mason, Jr., half of production duo The Underdogs, who co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Turn Up the Music", spoke more about the album, saying [...] "The Fortune record is F.A.M.E to the next level. Similar material, but he's really being innovative {{with some of the}} music that you haven't heard before, taking pieces of other genres and integrating them into pop and R, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> cool. Vocally, he sounds amazing; he's really, really coming into his own as a singer". Producer Damon Thomas, {{the other half of the}} duo, added [...] "The only way I can describe Chris and what he's doin' with this record that he's making is that he's this generation's Michael [...] ". On February 29, 2012, Brown tweeted [...] "I hope this album shows growth and positivity to all my fans and will inspire them to live life to the fullest!!! #FORTUNE". During a radio interview with Atlanta's Hot 107.9 in March 2012, rapper 2 Chainz revealed that he will be appearing as a guest vocalist on Fortune, however the track he was featured on did not make the final track listing. In May 2012, songwriter and producer William Orbit revealed that the best songs he made for Madonna's album MDNA (2012) that did not make the final track listing, would be included on Fortune.|$|E

6000|$|I am {{not sure}} that these cases are really exceptions. The law of [...] Composition of Causes, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> fulfilled, and the [...] {{appearance}} to the contrary is produced by attending to the remote [...] instead of the immediate effect of the causes. In the cases [...] mentioned, the immediate effect of the causes in action is a [...] collocation, and the duplication of the cause does double the [...] quantity of collocation. Two men could raise the gun to the required [...] angle twice as quickly as one, though one is enough. Two sparks put [...] two sets of particles of the gunpowder into the state of intestine [...] motion which makes them explode, though one is sufficient. It is the [...] collocation itself that does not, by being doubled, always double [...] the effect; because in many cases a certain collocation, once [...] obtained, is all that is required for the production of the whole [...] amount of effect which can be produced at all at the given time and [...] place. Doubling the collocation with difference of time and place, [...] as by pointing two guns, or exploding a second barrel after the [...] first, does double the effect. This remark applies still more to Mr. [...] Bain’s third example, that of a double dose of medicine; for a [...] double dose of an aperient does purge more violently, and a double [...] dose of laudanum does produce longer and sounder sleep. But a double [...] purging, or a double amount of narcotism, may have remote effects [...] different in kind from the effect of the smaller amount, reducing [...] the case to that of heteropathic laws, discussed in the text.|$|E
