5000|$|For {{all other}} hadd crimes, the fourth offense {{would be a}} capital offense, unless the person repents. [...] Other hadd crimes include incest, theft (serghat-e-haddi), {{lesbianism}} (mosahegheh), false accusation of sex crimes (ghazf), pimping (ghavvadi), and drunkenness (shurb-e-khamr). However, {{for all but the}} most serious cases the crime is punished through the tazir code and the judge gives a <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recognizing that juries {{in capital}} cases found {{discretion}} in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury could respond to mitigating factors {{about the crime}} or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900 23 {{states and the federal}} government had <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and by 1963 all death-penalty jurisdictions employed <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A tazir {{crime is}} a crime in Sharia law that {{receives}} a <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentence</b> by a judge. A deterrent crime is a tazir crime that has a punishment in Iran's Penal Code (mostly based on pre-Revolutionary French civil law). These crimes are divided into felonies, misdemeanors, and contraventions. All criminal acts have a civil code penalty in Iran, and are usually punished as such.|$|E
50|$|Since November 2012, {{the death}} penalty laws in Singapore were revised such that for murder cases, the <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentence</b> applies to those who {{committed}} murder but {{did not intend to}} kill. As an example, Jabing Kho was given a life sentence after he beat a Chinese construction worker Cao Ruyin to death with a tree branch and robbing Cao of his mobile phone. Cao died from brain injuries six days later. Kho was eventually given {{the death penalty}} by a jury as he had acted in a way which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. Kho's appeal for clemency was rejected in October 2015 by President Tony Tan Keng Yam.|$|E
50|$|Qesas {{cannot be}} applied in cases of self-defense or manslaughter, where the proof {{requirements}} above are not met, to minors (age 15 for boys, 9 for girls prior to 2008; after 2008, age 18 in most cases), to those declared insane, in {{a case where the}} victim is the perpetrator's spouse or spouse's lover and the perpetrator caught the spouse committing adultery, {{or in the case of}} a father murdering his children. In these cases, the perpetrator is punished through a tazir <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentence,</b> ranging from 2 years to life in prison. Sometimes the death penalty can be used regardless if the person has been found guilty of moharebeh ("spreading corruption on the earth"). Crimes of passion may not always be recognized as a legitimate defense, with the exception of a spouse caught committing adultery (punishable by imprisonment). People who murder in self-defense can usually be released after paying blood money to the victim's family, and the courts would usually help to facilitate that.|$|E
40|$|In 1965, {{alongside}} {{the abolition of}} capital punishment, a mandatory life sentence for murder was implemented in England and Wales. The mandatory life sentence served as {{a signal to the}} public that the criminal justice system would still implement the most severe sanction of life imprisonment in cases of murder. Nearly 50 years later, this article examines whether the imposition of a mandatory life sentence for murder is still {{in the best interests of}} justice or whether English homicide law would be better served by a <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> system. In doing so, the article considers debates surrounding the political and public need for a mandatory life sentence for murder by drawing upon interviews conducted with 29 members of the English criminal justice system. This research concludes that a <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> framework is required to adequately respond to the many contexts within which the crime of murder is committed...|$|R
40|$|In {{determining}} which constitutional procedural rights apply at sentencing, courts have distinguished between mandatory and <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> systems. For mandatory systems—systems that limit sentencing factors and specify particular punishments based on particular facts—defendants enjoy important rights {{including the right}} to a jury, the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to notice of potential sentencing aggravators, and the right not to be sentenced based on ex post facto laws. By contrast, for discretionary systems—systems that leave the determination of sentencing factors and how much punishment to impose based on particular facts to the judge’s discretion—defendants do not enjoy these protections. This Article challenges this discrepancy. It argues that, given the rationales underlying each of these rights, there is equal reason to apply these rights in <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> systems as in mandatory ones. As it explains, procedural rights regulate the means by which facts are found {{and the manner in which}} courts use those facts, and consequently are critical to discretionary systems. Just as in mandatory sentencing systems, judges in discretionary systems must make factual findings to determine the appropriate sentence to impose. This Article argues that the various justifications for providing fewer procedures in discretionary schemes are based on misconceptions about the nature of discretion at sentencing and inaccurate historical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Social Enquiry Reports (‘SERs’) are {{intended}} to assist the sentencing process. They are written by social workers primarily for judges. As such they represent an important and interesting point of exchange between two professional groups {{in the criminal justice}} system with different responsibilities, backgrounds and perspectives. In Scotland, reports are written by generically trained social workers who continue to work within social work departments and who may be more committed to welfare ideals than their counterparts in other jurisdictions (Robinson and McNeill, 2004). The <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> context in Scotland, set alongside the possibly more welfare-oriented professional identity of SER authors, make both the nature of the practice of social enquiry and its significance for sentencing matters of particular interest...|$|R
5000|$|Qisas {{cannot be}} applied in cases of self-defense, manslaughter, where the case lacks the proof requirements, on minors (age 15 for boys, 9 for girls prior to 2012, after 2012 aged 18 in most cases), on insane people, a person who murdered a spouse and/or their lover {{caught in the act}} of adultery, a father who murders his children, etc. Depending on the crime, they would be punished through a tazir <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentence,</b> ranging from no prison to 2 years in prison to life imprisonment. Sometimes the death penalty can be used if the person has been found guilty of [...] "spreading {{corruption}} on the earth" [...] or [...] "moharebeh". Crimes of passion are not recognized as a legitimate defense, {{with the exception of the}} spouse caught in adultery. Self-defense and insanity is also narrowly defined. With the exception of manslaughter, and where proof requirements are lacking, none need to pay diyyeh either. If a murderer was working on the orders of another and he/she can prove it, they will receive a tazir punishment (imprisonment, fines and/or whipping, sometimes even death), while the person(s) who ordered the killing will suffer qisas/diyyeh.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{stringent}} traditional {{restrictions on}} application of hudud punishments, they were seldom applied historically. [...] For example, aside from [...] "a few rare and isolated" [...] instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, {{there is no}} historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out. Criminals who escaped hudud punishments could still be sanctioned under the system of tazir, which gave judges and and high officials <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> powers to punish crimes which did not fall under the categories of hudud and qisas. In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia. During the 19th century, sharia-based criminal laws were replaced by statutes inspired by European models nearly everywhere in the Islamic world, except some particularly conservative regions such as the Arabian peninsula.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} century, all common law {{countries}} {{have experienced a}} movement away from a highly <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing</b> environment to one in which judicial discretion is more constrained. (For general discussion of structured sentencing, see chapter 6 of A. von Hirsch, A. Ashworth and J. V. Roberts (eds), Principled Sentencing: Readings on Theory and Policy (3 rd edn, Oxford: Hart, 2009).) Some jurisdictions have transformed their sentencing environments by introducing relatively inflexible and tightly binding guideline schemes. Others have taken a middle ground - creating advisory guidance schemes - while a third category has resisted all attempts to structure judicial discretion. This essay describes and compares the divergent histories of two jurisdictions - Canada, and England and Wales - as they have confronted the challenge of structuring sentencing. Despite similarities {{in the way that}} sentencing is approached in the two countries they have taken remarkably divergent paths over the past 25 years - and not in the directions that might have been anticipated back in the mid 1980 s. After a promising start in that decade, Canada has rejected the adoption of sentencing guidelines, and elected to retain its traditional, highly <b>discretionary</b> approach to <b>sentencing.</b> In contrast, England and Wales has slowly, but surely, adopted a comprehensive and relatively binding set of guidelines, although this outcome also seemed unlikely in 1988. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Hanging, however, remained available until 1998 when, under a House of Lords amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, proposed by Lord Archer of Sandwell, the death penalty was abolished for treason and piracy with violence, replacing it with a <b>discretionary</b> maximum <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment. These were the last civilian offences punishable by death.|$|R
40|$|Constitutional norms, {{statutory}} {{rules and}} common law principles govern {{the art and}} science of sentencing in Hong Kong. Death penalty and corporal punishments are sentencing measures of the past. As reflected in a 2014 law reform report on suspended sentences, the emphasis now is on <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing,</b> although murder still carries a mandatory life imprisonment. Hong Kong courts have {{a full range of}} sentencing options to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and offender. Sentencing decisions are informed by traditional purposes of punishment including public protection, deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation and reparation for victims. The purpose of denunciation has been cited by judges more frequently in recent years. Restorative justice, however, is not commonly referred to. Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal provides guideline sentences for specific offences; such guidelines assist courts in setting the starting point sentence in a particular case. Aggravating and mitigating factors serve respectively to move the sentence marker up and down. While proportionality is an applied constitutional principle of sentencing, courts still enhance sentences in cases of prevalent organised crime and routinely give sentencing discounts on pleas of guilty or for assistance given to the authorities. postprin...|$|R

40|$|In this article, Professor Herrmann {{argues that}} the due process protections of a {{criminal}} trial should apply to aggravating factors that under current “maximum-enhancing statutes” allow judges to impose lengthier punishments in the sentencing phase. Part I considers the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rationale for refusing to apply full due process safeguards to all types of sentencing schemes. This background will reveal the unique quality of maximum-enhancing statutes and establish why the due process protections of a criminal trial should apply to sentencing under maximum-enhancing statutes. Part I, therefore, undertakes to explain courts 2 ̆ 7 rationales to deny criminal defendants full criminal due process under <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentencing,</b> mandatory minimum sentencing, and guideline sentencing. Part II focuses on maximum-enhancing statutes. It isolates and analyzes the courts 2 ̆ 7 rationales for denying criminal defendants full criminal due process under them. Part II argues that no convincing rationale justifies reduced due process for minimum-enhancing statutes, no matter what one 2 ̆ 7 s views of the due process reasoning underlying other sentencing structures. Part III will argue that, if courts applied full criminal due process protection to maximum-enhancing factors, {{it is unlikely that}} legislatures would try to avoid the safeguards by artful drafting of criminal statutes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} creation of and changes in specific legal rights and protections provided under the criminal law for children in Connecticut from 1635 to 1855. Changes in legal status and procedures as they affected children reflected a shift {{to the belief that}} children were inherently different from adults, requiring unique treatment by the courts when they committed crimes. Perhaps most important was the fact that Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s laws created a number of distinctions in categories of childhood, adding to the complexity of trying and sentencing children. Furthermore, by the nineteenth century, new views of children as patients to be reformed eventually led to <b>discretionary</b> <b>sentences</b> for children under sixteen, and ultimately to the opening of the State Reform School for Boys in 1854. ^ The first three chapters study changes in legal attitudes and procedures in three major areas: crimes against property, crimes against persons, and crimes against public order. One result of the changes was that adults came to view children as less capable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The most revolutionary transformation was the way in which criminal procedures developed to provide legal assistance to children in court. This analysis traces the shift from informal notice to parents or guardians to the formal appointment of a guardian ad litem or formal legal counsel {{to protect the rights of}} the child. ^ In chapters four and five the dissertation analyzes the ways in which Connecticut developed the concept that children required specific laws to protect them from physical and sexual abuse. Finally, chapter six analyzes the intersection between the increasing stress on the importance of education and nurture for children and the rise of reform attitudes in the nineteenth century. These reform concepts led to the belief that children who broke the law were not criminals to be punished, but patients to be treated and returned to society as contributing members of the community. Evidence from the State Reform School for Boys provides support for the conclusion that adults now viewed children as distinct from adults and worthy of a second chance if they broke the law. ...|$|R

40|$|The legal {{standards}} for reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing are underdeveloped. In other contexts, defendants seeking to prove ineffective assistance must demonstrate that counsel 2 ̆ 7 s performance fell below appropriate professional standards {{and that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel 2 ̆ 7 s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The doctrinal uncertainty whether that standard applies to sentencing proceedings in non-capital cases, coupled with worries that ineffective assistance at sentencing claims will result in a flood of litigation, has led some courts to require defendants to satisfy stricter prejudice standards in <b>discretionary</b> non-capital <b>sentencing</b> regimes. This Article analyzes the ineffective assistance jurisprudence and concludes that the sufficiency of counsel 2 ̆ 7 s performance is largely evaluated against a backdrop of relevant substantive law. The substantive law of non-capital sentencing is not welldeveloped, which may explain the underdeveloped state of ineffective assistance at sentencing standards. Drawing on several recent ineffective assistance cases in the death penalty context, this Article identifies legal principles and practices that may assist in making the legal assessments necessary to analyze ineffective assistance at sentencing claims. These principles and practices may provide a sufficient legal framework to render unnecessary the crude manipulation of the prejudice showing that some courts have employed...|$|R
40|$|Over {{twenty years}} ago, the United States Supreme Court held that both {{mandatory}} capital sentencing schemes and total <b>discretionary</b> capital <b>sentencing</b> schemes violate the Eighth Amendment. According to Jeffrey Kirchmeier, the 2 ̆ 2 guided discretion 2 ̆ 2 capital sentencing scheme of sentencing factors that has developed, however, has the constitutional problems of both mandatory death penalties and unlimited discretion death penalties. Justices Scalia, Blackmun, and Thomas {{have noted that}} the mandate of unlimited mitigating circumstances has resulted in an arbitrary system. Kirchmeier argues that today 2 ̆ 7 s sentencing scheme is arbitrary also because of undefined aggravating factors, unlimited nonstatutory aggravating factors, and victim impact evidence. According to Kirchmeier, the death penalty scheme also has moved toward a mandatory scheme as legislatures expand death penalty statutes and the Court sanctions other expansions of {{the application of the}} penalty. Thus, argues Kirchmeier, the paradox of the present system is that it is both arbitrary and mandatory. Focusing on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding aggravating and mitigating factors, this Article discusses the arbitrary and mandatory aspects of the current system and then examines five options for addressing those constitutional problems: keeping the present system, narrowing the application of the death penalty, returning to unguided discretion statutes, returning to mandatory death penalty schemes, or, as Justices Blackmun and Powell have suggested, abandoning the death penalty. This Article concludes that a mandatory death penalty scheme {{is the only way to}} potentially apply the death penalty in an evenhanded manner. The mandatory aspects of the current scheme and the historical experience with mandatory death penalty schemes, however, illustrate that no human system for selecting defendants for the ultimate punishment can be both fair and nonarbitrary...|$|R
40|$|In England and Wales, life {{imprisonment}} {{is the ultimate}} sanction for the most serious crimes. The introduction of Discretionary Lifer Panels (DLPs) in 1992 was a major development {{in the way that}} lifers are managed within the penal system. This thesis explores 'life after {{life imprisonment}}' for the first cohort of discretionary lifers who were released into the community through the DLP process. The study is set {{in the context of a}} renewed interest in empirical research on the resettlement of ex-prisoners, yet little of this work has focused on life-sentenced offenders. By investigating the resettlement process of 138 discretionary lifers released on life licence between 1992 and 1997, this research contributes to empirical and theoretical understanding of rehabilitation and desistance from crime after long-term imprisonment. Part One considers the various factors that have shaped the <b>discretionary</b> life <b>sentence,</b> and sets out the research methods used. Part Two examines the role of the Probation Service in the process of resettlement. Based on empirical work across probation areas, it sheds light on the claim that contemporary probation practice is indicative of a more general authoritarian and exclusionary approach to resettlement. Part Three explores the 'disistance and persistance' process for lifers. It provides a detailed analysis of the narrative accounts of resettled lifers, and explores the reasons why they had given up crime. It also highlights the growing numbers of recalled lifers, and seeks to identify factors associated with failure on life licence. This thesis concludes by arguing that rehabilitation continues to have a prominent place within the discourse of resettlement. Overall, this thesis lends support to theories of disistance from crime that emphasise the importance of shifts in offenders' narrative identities to explain cessation from criminal behaviour, and highlights the role of a professional relationship as a powerful vehicle for change.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the policy of}} diversion for mentally disordered offenders (set out in the Home Office and Department of Health review of Health and Social Services for Mentally Disordered Offenders (The Reed Report, 1992)) from a therapeutic jurisprudence perspective, querying whether the exercise of <b>discretionary</b> judgement by <b>sentencing</b> judges, psychiatrists and probation officers facilitate diversion. The thesis uses qualitative interviews with psychiatrists, probation officers and Crown Court judges to explore the role of professional discretion {{in the implementation of}} the policy of diversion. Using a hypothetical scenario, interviews explored how professionals approach the task of sentencing and preparing pre-sentence reports; what factors they consider, what they describe as their purposes, and how they resolve any conflicts between their various aims. In examining the exercise of discretion in this way, the study moves analysis of barriers to diversion beyond accounts of structural impediments (for example, limited resources) and instead explores how such structural factors are expressed in individual discretionary judgements. The study also examines how such structural factors interact with individual beliefs about the purposes of diversion, and circumstances in which it will be appropriate. Interviews suggested that despite recognising the importance of therapeutic outcomes, sentencing judges expressed concerns regarding the ability of healthcare services to guarantee public protection, and expressed divergent views regarding whether therapeutic disposals compromised the punitive import of sentencing. Interviews with psychiatrists found disagreement {{on the extent to which}} recommendations should be influenced by concerns with public protection and concern regarding whether resources were appropriately used on those referred by the court. In demonstrating how such concerns may promote non-therapeutic outcomes, this study suggests ambiguities in the normative foundations of diversion policy, and the complex interests professionals involved in its implementation are required to balance render discretionary decisions a potential obstacle to successful diversion. The study therefore concludes by suggesting means by which diversion policy might be developed to better promote therapeutic outcomes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
