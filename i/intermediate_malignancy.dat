5000|$|The tumor {{may present}} {{different}} degrees of differentiation: low grade (differentiated), <b>intermediate</b> <b>malignancy</b> and high malignancy (anaplastic). Depending on this differentiation, tumour cells may resemble mature fibroblasts (spindle-shaped), secreting collagen, with rare mitoses. These cells are arranged in short fascicles which split and merge, giving the appearance of [...] "fish bone" [...] known as a herringbone pattern. Poorly differentiated tumors consist in more atypical cells, pleomorphic, giant cells, multinucleated, numerous atypical mitoses and reduced collagen production. Presence of immature blood vessels (sarcomatous vessels lacking endothelial cells) favors the bloodstream metastasizing. There are many tumors in the differential diagnosis, including spindle cell melanoma, spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Follicular {{dendritic}} cell (FDC) sarcoma {{is a rare}} neoplasm arising in lymph nodes but also in extranodal sites from accessory cells {{of the immune system}} that are essential for the function of antigen presentation and germinal center reaction regulation. FDC sarcoma has a significant recurrent and metastatic potential and for these reason it should be viewed as an <b>intermediate</b> grade <b>malignancy.</b> Methods We report the case of a 49 -year old woman patient who showed persistent, enlarged, hard, cervical lymph node. The most common histologic feature was the presence of oval to spindle cells with elongated nuclei, vesicular or stippled chromatin and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were diffusely positive for follicular {{dendritic cell}} markers CD 21, CD 23 and negative for cytokeratin. The patient after complete excision of the lymph node underwent five courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with COP plus PEG-liposomal doxorubicin, considering the propensity of the tumor to metastasize. Results No hematological or cardiac toxicity were registered and among the other extra hematological effects only transitory palmar erythrodysesthesia is worthy of mention. After a follow up of 5 years the patient is alive and in CR. Conclusion These results suggest that this therapeutic modality may be useful in the management of FDC sarcoma. </p...|$|R

50|$|If {{there is}} an <b>intermediate</b> risk of <b>malignancy,</b> further imaging with {{positron}} emission tomography (PET scan) is appropriate (if available). Around 95% of patients with a malignant nodule will have an abnormal PET scan, while around 78% of patients with a benign nodule will look normal on PET (this is the test sensitivity and specificity). Thus, an abnormal PET scan will reliably pick up cancer, but several other types of nodules (inflammatory or infectious, for example) will also show up on a PET scan. If the nodule has a diameter below 1 centimeter, PET scans are often avoided because {{there is an}} increased risk of falsely normal results. Cancerous lesions usually have a high metabolism on PET, as demonstrated by their high uptake of FDG (a radioactive sugar). If the lesion is found on further imaging to be suspicious, it should be surgically excised (via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery) to confirm the diagnosis by microscopical examination.|$|R

Glucose consumption in the tumors was calculated using Patlak's graphical analysis with an assumption made for the lumped constant. Standardized uptake values also were calculated. Results: All soft-tissue sarcomas were clearly depicted, The median glucose consumption was 13. 0 mu mole/ 100 g/min (range 2. 9 - 41. 8 mu mole/ 100 g/min).

40|$|Introduction: Pineal parenchymal tumor of {{intermediate}} differentiation (PPTID) {{was recognized}} in the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) classification as a new pineal parenchymal neoplasm, <b>intermediate</b> in <b>malignancy</b> (WHO grade II or III) between pineocytoma (grade I) and pineoblastoma (grade IV). The imaging spectrum of this new tumor has not been previously delineated. We describe the imaging spectrum in 11 pathologically proven PPTIDs and identify findings that may suggest the preoperative diagnosis of this newly recognized entity. Methods: Electronic medical records over the last 9 years and teaching files between the years 1985 and 1995 were searched for atypical pineal lesions. Additional cases were added from the teaching files of contributing authors. Results: Imaging studies in nine patients (9 / 11) showed bulky, aggressive pineal region masses with local brain invasion; two patients (2 / 11) demonstrated circumscribed pineal masses. Two patients had spinal metastases at presentation. On computed tomography (CT), five patients had classic "exploded" calcifications characteristic of pineal parenchymal tumors. All tumors were heterogeneously hypointense on T 1 WIs and heterogeneously hyperintense on T 2 WIs. Post-contrast scans showed marked heterogeneous (10 / 11) or uniform (1 / 11) enhancement. Cystic foci were identified in eight cases. Intratumoral hemorrhage was present in one case. Conclusion: While no singular neuroimaging feature is pathognomonic of PPTID, these tumors are usually larger, demonstrate local invasion, and appear much more heterogeneous than pineocytoma. Because PPTIDs have a higher grade and increased potential for recurrence as compared to pineocytomas, {{it is important to}} consider this diagnosis as shorter follow-up, and adjuvant therapy may be indicated in selected cases. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

The study aimed at determining the histopathological pattern of thyroid tumors and to show the distribution of age, sex, risk factors, origin, ethnic groups, and clinical presentation of these tumors. Ninety seven (97) cases of thyroid tumors were analyzed in the study. The age of the patients ranged between 12 to 80 years with a mean of 37. 54 + 14. 72 years. The commonest age group was 30 to 20 to < 50 was the commonest age group affected by malignant thyroid tumors (55. 5 %). No malignant thyroid tumors was diagnosed in age group < 11 years. As a conclusion, the study showed that thyroid cancers occurred most commonly in young and middle aged adults and was rare in children. Regarding the grading of thyroid malignancies 52 % of thyroid cancers in the study were of low grade malignancy, 37 % were <b>intermediate</b> grade <b>malignancy</b> and 11. 1 % were of high grade malignancy.

We describe a novel reconstructive method for half forehead defects with an innovative single local wide scalp flap following excision of DFSP with a 3 [*]cm margin of healthy tissue. Methods Two patients underwent wide resection of forehead DFSP and reconstruction with a single rotational scalp flap. The scalp flap blood supply was provided from three main vessels: the superficial temporal artery, occipital artery and posterior auricular artery. Results No early or late complications were observed in either patient with no local recurrence after 18 [*]months of follow-up.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 3 decades, fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) has developed {{as the most}} accurate and cost-effective initial method for guiding the clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules. Thyroid FNA specimens containing follicular-patterned lesions are the most commonly encountered and include various forms of benign thyroid nodules, follicular carcinomas, and the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Based primarily upon the cytoarchitectural pattern, FNA {{is used as a}} screening test for follicular-patterned lesions to identify the majority of patients with benign nodules who can be managed without surgical intervention. The terminology and reporting of thyroid FNA results have been problematic due to significant variation between laboratories, but the recent multidisciplinary NCI Thyroid FNA State of the Science Conference has provided a seven-tiered diagnostic solution. A key element of this approach is the category “atypical cells of undetermined significance” (ACUS) which is used for those aspirates which cannot be easily classified as benign, suspicious, or malignant. Lesions in this category represent approximately 3 – 6 % of thyroid FNAs and have a risk of <b>malignancy</b> <b>intermediate</b> between the “benign” category and the “suspicious for a follicular neoplasm” category.
