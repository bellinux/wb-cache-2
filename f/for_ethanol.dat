5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E

Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Government {{officials}} and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers {{in order to}} import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> production. The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E

50|$|The Brazilian {{government}} provided {{three important}} initial motivators <b>for</b> the <b>ethanol</b> industry: guaranteed purchases by the {{state-owned oil company}} Petrobras, low-interest loans <b>for</b> agro-industrial <b>ethanol</b> firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices where hydrous <b>ethanol</b> sold <b>for</b> 59% of the government-set gasoline price at the pump. These incentives made ethanol production competitive.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{government}} subsidies <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> production have prompted many farmers {{to switch to}} production for biofuel. Maize is the primary crop used {{for the production of}} ethanol, with the United States being the biggest producer of maize ethanol. As a result, 23 percent of United States maize crops were being used <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> in 2006–2007 (up from 6 percent in 2005–2006), and the USDA expects the United States to use 81 million tons of maize <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> production in the 2007–2008 season, up 37 percent. This not only diverts grains from food, but it diverts agricultural land from food production.|$|E

25|$|Corn, {{a pillar}} of the American {{agriculture}} system for years, is now mainly used <b>for</b> <b>ethanol,</b> {{high fructose corn syrup}} and bio-based plastics. About 40 percent of corn is used <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> and 36% is used as animal feed. Only a tiny fraction of corn is used as a food source, much of that fraction is used for high-fructose corn syrup, which is a main ingredient in processed, unhealthy junk food.|$|E
25|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E

50|$|Rarely, {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with <b>ethanol</b> <b>for</b> metabolism, <b>ethanol</b> is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in methylated spirits, denatured ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling <b>ethanol</b> intended <b>for</b> human consumption. Methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute <b>for</b> regular <b>ethanol</b> alcoholic beverages.|$|R

25|$|An {{effective}} treatment to prevent toxicity after methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenase {{has a higher}} affinity <b>for</b> <b>ethanol,</b> thus preventing methanol from binding and acting as a substrate.

25|$|Nevertheless, {{supporters}} of ethanol claim that using corn <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> is {{not responsible for}} the worst food riots in the world, many of which have been caused by the price of rice and oil, which are not affected by biofuel use but rather by supply and demand.|$|E
25|$|The demand <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> fuel {{produced}} from field corn was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market <b>for</b> <b>ethanol</b> fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E
