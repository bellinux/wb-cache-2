500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} month, amid increasing criticism, the McDaniels rescinded {{the reward}} offer. [...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come to believe that, if he had not died in the cave, Ben had been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do so, they said. (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex Spring area for exactly this reason).|$|E
2500|$|On August 11, 1999, Greenlee Smythe {{made her}} debut. After winning the role, Budig further {{explained}} {{her interest in}} the part and her early portrayal of the character: [...] "This was a recurring role," [...] she stated. [...] "I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble. It was the summer; I figured there wasn't going to be anything going on in L.A. [...] why {{not go back to}} New York? Plus, I never get to play the bad girl and delve into the dark side. I'm always playing the good girl. It's been exciting because the role has really come to fruition these past three months. Her dad's a drunk, her mother pays no attention to her, she lives with her grandmother [...] she's pathetically desperate, kind of like me. I'm kidding. I love her name; it's so debutante. I think she's {{going to continue to be}} a spoiler.|$|E
2500|$|In {{intensive}} broiler sheds, the air {{can become}} highly polluted with ammonia from the droppings. In {{this case a}} farmer must run more fans {{to bring in more}} clean fresh air. If not this can damage the chickens' eyes and respiratory systems and can cause painful burns on their legs (called hock burns) and blisters on their feet. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high rate of leg deformities because the large breast muscles causes distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. In cases where the chickens become crippled and can't walk farmers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and pull them out. Because they cannot move easily, the chickens are not able to adjust their environment to avoid heat, cold or dirt as they would in natural conditions. [...] The added weight and overcrowding also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs and Ascites can develop. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year. In the case of no ventilation due to power failure during a heat wave 20,000 chicken can die {{in a short period of}} time. In a good grow out a farmer should sell between 92 and 96 percent of their flock. With a 1.80 to a 2.0 feed conversion ratio. After the marking of birds the farmer must clean out and repair for another flock. A farmer should average 4 to 5 grow outs a year.|$|E

50|$|Mackenzie was {{constructed}} in 1925 with an enrollment of about 25 to 30 students. In 1930 the official school was built and opened for grades K <b>to</b> 7.
