40|$|Bread <b>doughs</b> <b>with</b> {{different}} {{physico-chemical properties}} were characterised using the microwave power transmission technique. A factorial design experiment incorporating {{three levels of}} mixing pressures, salt contents and water levels which produced <b>doughs</b> <b>with</b> various densities, salt and moisture contents was performed. Measurements of microwave transmission variables, the attenuation and phase shift were made using a microwave network analyser. Dough densities were measured using a double cup technique. Increasing mixing pressure decreased dough density and both the microwave variables significantly. <b>Doughs</b> <b>with</b> higher salt content showed {{a significant increase in}} attenuation while those with higher moisture content gave a significant increase in phase shift. The linearly regressed model functions of dough density and microwave measurements showed a correlation of R 2 > 0. 97, thus gave implications of a reduction in microwave power absorption and transmission in aerated doughs. This non-destructive measurement method is potentially useful and can be developed for online density monitoring in the dough processing industry...|$|R

25|$|In the 1st century AD {{writings}} of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides {{a recipe for}} lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of <b>dough</b> <b>with</b> meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape. The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.|$|E

Each of the isolates was used to ferment wheat flour dough and baked. Sensory analysis of the doughs was carried out on leavening, texture, aroma, taste and appearance. Saccharomyces cerevisiae performed best in leavening the dough while Debaryomyces hansenii produced <b>doughs</b> <b>with</b> the best taste and aroma. Appearances of the <b>doughs</b> made <b>with</b> all the isolated yeasts {{did not differ significantly}} (P< 0. 05) from that of the dough that lacked yeast...|$|R
5000|$|A loaf is a shape, usually rounded or oblong, mass of food. It may {{refer to}} a whole article of bread. Technically, any unit of bread is called a [...] "loaf", no matter what its shape, and the loaf can {{therefore}} vary in the ratio of length to width, and in its roundness. However, {{it is common to}} bake bread in a rectangular bread pan, also called a loaf pan, because different kinds of bread dough have different levels of viscosity, meaning that some doughs will tend to collapse and spread out more than others during the cooking process. <b>Doughs</b> <b>with</b> a thicker viscosity can be hand-molded into the desired loaf shape, and cooked without using any kind of walled pan. The shape of <b>doughs</b> <b>with</b> a thinner viscosity can be maintained with a bread pan whose sides are higher than the uncooked dough.|$|R

Rub butter into flour; blend ... Set it to rise in a warm place, ... bake lightly and thoroughly till golden brown." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers {{played a crucial}} role in any medieval community. Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century. Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around [...] of bread per person per day. Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers', and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house, and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating <b>dough</b> <b>with</b> less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the [...] "baker's dozen": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "dessert" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French desservir, [...] "to clear a table", {{literally}} [...] "to un-serve", and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar, honey or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There was a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and <b>dough</b> <b>with</b> various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling. [...] Le Ménagier de Paris ("Parisian Household Book") written in 1393 includes a quiche recipe made with three kinds of cheese, eggs, beet greens, spinach, fennel fronds, and parsley.|$|E

2500|$|In New Orleans, Louisiana, {{parts of}} {{southern}} Texas, and surrounding regions, a similar ring-shaped cake {{known as a}} [...] "King Cake" [...] traditionally becomes available in bakeries from Epiphany to Mardi Gras. The baby Jesus figurine is inserted into the cake from underneath, {{and the person who}} gets the slice with the figurine is expected to buy or bake the next King Cake. There is wide variation among the types of pastry that may be called a King Cake, but most are a baked cinnamon-flavoured twisted <b>dough</b> <b>with</b> thin frosting and additional sugar on top in the traditional Mardi Gras colours of gold, green and purple. To prevent accidental injury or choking, the baby Jesus figurine is frequently not inserted into the cake at the bakery, but included in the packaging for optional use by the buyer to insert it themselves.

2500|$|Germans eat a Three Kings cake {{which may}} be a golden pastry ring filled with orange and spice {{representing}} gold, frankincense and myrrh.

Or they may be made of typical rich Christmas bread <b>dough</b> <b>with</b> cardamom and pearl sugar in the same seven bun crown shape. These varieties are most typically purchased in supermarkets with the trinket, and gold paper crown included. As in other countries, the person who receives the piece or bun containing the trinket or whole almond becomes the king or queen for a day. Epiphany is also an especially joyful occasion for the young and young at heart as this is the day dedicated to plündern – that is, when Christmas trees are [...] "plundered" [...] of their cookies and sweets by eager children (and adults) and when gingerbread houses, and any other good things left in the house from Christmas are devoured. Lastly, there is a German rhyme saying, or Bauernregel, that goes Ist's bis Dreikönigs kein Winter, kommt keiner dahinter meaning [...] "If there hasn't been any Winter (weather) until Epiphany, none is coming afterward."
