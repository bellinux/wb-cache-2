40|$|Italy and Spain are {{paradigmatic}} {{examples of}} the so-called “Southern European welfare model”, in which the long-term care needs of dependent elderly people are mainly covered by family and <b>intergenerational</b> <b>solidarities,</b> while the institutional support (in particular through in-kind services) is structurally residual.

Despite these different institutional trajectories, our hypothesis is that the two countries still share important similarities due to the impact of the austerity policies and the functioning of a multilevel governance of long-term care policy characterised by a sort of vicious layering, which stimulates negative consequences in terms of territorial inequalities and cost-shifting dynamics (included increasing users’ copayment) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Most {{research}} has viewed gambling {{as an individual}} activity and very little {{research has}} been devoted to the impacts of family gambling.

40|$|In Portugal, {{the eldest}} remain {{particularly}} vulnerable to poverty: 30 % of the population aged 65 and over {{live below the poverty}} line. Does poverty mean less family solidarity? To answer this question we used data from a sample survey of 1100 elderly. From a categorical principal components analysis based on variables of monetary poverty, of poverty according to living conditions and of subjective poverty, we define a multiple index of poverty. Structural and functional <b>intergenerational</b> family <b>solidarities</b> (Bengtson and Roberts, 1991) were studied within groups according to their level of poverty describe by this multiple index. We found that Portugal does not follow the tendency of the majority of European countries where living alone in old age can be an option made possible by the improvement of the living conditions of this segment of population. In Portugal, the poorest elderly are those who live alone or who live far from an adult child. The geographical distance between residences of elderly parents and the adult descendents determines the frequency of the contacts. Visits are less frequent in the poorest group when the parents dwelling place are situated at a medium distance far away from their sons or daughters' domicile. The poorest elderly also have less phone contacts with their offsprings. Family loneliness is then more significant in this social group. However, when one analyzes the exchanges between elderly and their descendents, one notes that the poorest elderly obtain and provide care to their children more often than elderly from others social groups. All things considered, structural <b>intergenerational</b> family <b>solidarities</b> are less intense in the poorest group but functional solidarities are more expressive. This last fact may contribute to reduce agedrelated inequalities {{but at the same time}} reinforces gender inequalities considering that exchanges are mainly supported by women...|$|R

Three distinct temporal aspects must be considered: historical time, which applies to the maintenance of solidarity over time despite structural change in both families and society; generational time implied by the primacy of intergenerational exchanges; and finally, biographical time, which refers to the calendar of individual and family trajectories. An extensive array of quantitative data collections are examined to illustrate how they allow to study these different aspects of the temporality of exchanges...|$|R

40|$|DYKSTRA# This study {{draws on}} {{national}} survey {{data from the}} United States of America (USA) and the Netherlands to compare family obligations and support behaviour for middle-generation adults who have a living aged parent and adult child. Consistent with a familialism by default hypothesis based on welfare state differences, the US sample espouses stronger family obligations than the Dutch sample. Yet, the Dutch respondents {{are more likely to}} engage in family support behaviours with both the younger and older generations, contrary to a family-steps-in hypothesis. The connection between family obligations and support behaviour is also tested, revealing a stronger association in the US sample, consistent with a family-steps-in hypothesis, but only in regard to relations with ageing parents. We conclude that Dutch respondents are more likely to act on their individual preferences whereas American respondents aremore influenced by general norms of obligation towards family members. The findings are discussed in terms of social policy differences between the two countries, and in light of results from comparative European studies of intergenerational relations.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is a reflection}} {{on the concept of}} active ageing from the perspective of relational sociology. At the same time, it offers practical implications and outlines possible future courses of action, in the face of demographic and relational scenarios rapidly changing, and the challenges that each day people of all generations are called to cope with. Active ageing is quite a recent concept and indicates an attitude towards aging that enhances the quality of life as people become older. The goal of active ageing is to enable people to realise their potential for physical, social and mental well-being and to participate in social life also in the last stage of the life cycle. In this phase, the presence of a network of support, security and care adequate to the possible onset of problems and criticalities is crucial. Relational sociology frames the phenomenon of an aging population in a dense network of social relations, primarily at the level of family and community. For this reason, as supported by the most recent sociological literature and evidence from studies conducted in Italy and abroad (cf. SHARE), it is extremely important to investigate the link between active aging, <b>intergenerational</b> orientation (<b>solidarity</b> and exchanges) and practices of pro-sociality (i. e. engagement in third-sector activities and volunteering in later life) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{response}} to Berry's arguments on the impact of population ageing as potentially marginalising younger people in the democratic process. Berry constructs a pessimistic account where a powerful grey vote will enact an age-based ‘majority rule’ and posits this as a ‘democratic deficit’ that contravenes the ‘unwritten’ rules of democracy. This response argues that automatic assumptions of age-related majority rule are frequently based upon a highly flawed grey power model and the need to incorporate <b>intergenerational</b> and intra-family <b>solidarity,</b> as well as life-cycle factors into these debates. This response agrees that older voters are likely to become much more important in electoral politics, but not because they will vote as a bloc or aggressively pursue material self-interest, but because ageing policy challenges may increasingly attain the status of valence issues in future elections.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} life expectancy in industrialized countries, {{parents and children}} share more time together. Irrespective {{of the existence of}} a social security system, the exchange of support remains important in the parent-child relationship throughout the whole life (Arber 2 ̆ 6 Attias-Donfut, 2000). This intergenerational exchange is comprised of emotional, instrumental, and financial support, and represents a major aspect of the model of <b>intergenerational</b> functional <b>solidarity</b> developed by Bengtson and colleagues (e. g. Bengtson 2 ̆ 6 Roberts, 1991). The main goal {{of this study was to}} test one assumption of this model, namely that a balance between support provided and received will increase the quality of the parent-child relationship (Bengtson 2 ̆ 6 Roberts, 1991), and may also be relevant for well-being, especially among the older generation. Eighty three dyads of middle aged women (M = 45. 17 years, SD = 5. 68) and their mothers (M = 67. 92 years, SD = 6. 00) from a large city in the Midwest were interviewed. Cross-sectional self report data with respect to the extent of different forms of support they give and receive, relationship quality, and life satisfaction were assessed. Preliminary analyses show that a reciprocally balanced perception of the give-and-take between adult daughters and their mothers led to greater intimacy and fewer conflicts between them. Also, the results suggest that receiving support per se is not always beneficial for the recipient.

40|$|Europe is {{experiencing}} demographic and social challenges unprecedented in its history. Migration flows, {{though not a}} new phenomenon, represent one of these challenges. Migration as the movement of social and national groups within as well as into Europe includes several motivations and objectives. Depending on these motivations, migrants are considered as welcome asset or as not-wanted claiming benefits of the national social security systems. What can we learn from earlier migration waves? Currently, {{a large number of}} first-generation immigrants of the big immigration waves of the 1960 s and 1970 s are approaching retirement age in many European countries. Contrary to earlier expectations, studies have shown that only a part of these aging migrants return to their countries of origin after retirement, whereas a larger part decides to stay permanently in the receiving country or to commute between both countries. Growing old in the context of migration has thus become a hot topic for many societies. Based on research from several European countries with large shares of immigrants, namely UK, Estonia, Denmark and Luxembourg, the special issue aging and migration focuses on some key questions regarding aging migrants. For instance, {{what do we know about}} cultural and ethnic identities of older migrants and how these are related to their transnational family relationships? How can social networks and <b>intergenerational</b> family <b>solidarity</b> of older migrants be described? What are specifics of care in the context of acculturation? The present contributions give some first answers to these questions, taking also into account how subjective well-being of aging migrants and their families might be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the problems of <b>intergenerational</b> family <b>solidarity</b> from the viewpoint of the caregivers. The main objective consists in charting factors that influence the living together of caregivers and old age pensioners in one household. The thesis is comprised of a theoretical and explorative part. The theoretical part is focused on assessing the current state of intergenerational living together, use of social services, care for an old age pensioner in a home environment, needs ensuing from the old age and last but not least on the mental health of the caregiver. The chapter of my thesis called current state is concentrated on the intergenerational relations. I mentioned the concepts of the so-called "sandwich family" and family solidarity. The following part has been devoted to the old age, its needs and physiological changes that occur at this age. In the subsequent chapter called the care for an old age pensioner in a home environment I was trying to define both the form of the care for the pensioner which is provided by the family member, risks arising from this situation and the importance of the care for the person who provides care for the pensioner. Last part is devoted to the mental health of caregivers. The objective of my thesis {{can be found in the}} explorative part. I charted the factors of living together of pensioners and caregivers in one household. I asked a main explorative question: "How do caregivers see the intergenerational living together in one household?" The main explorative question was devided further into five partial explorative questions. "How does a caregiver see the pros and cons of the living together with the pensioner?" "How does the caregiver view the situation in the future when there is a real threat of deterioration?" "How does the caregiver use the social services while caring for the pensioner?" "How is the mental health of caregivers going?" "What other resources does the family use?" I decided to select the strategy of qualitative research in order to detect the information. The data were collected by means of making inquiries and by leading a semi-structured interview. The research team was intentionally chosen of quotas and it consisted of seven caregivers who care for the pensioner in a home environment. The research continued by stages, first of all there was a pre-research. Then the actual research followed. All the interviews were recorded on the dictaphon and copied word for word. The collected information was processed through the method of clustering. Consequently, the data were processsed and interpreted through common components. The final data were structured into the separate partial questions. The study follows that partners in the interview lay stress on the high-quality care for their relatives and expect their children to care for them in a similar manner. They´d welcome a certain kind of relief in order to relax and to practise hobbies. Other factors that might influence the living together with the pensioner in one household might be, for example, lack of interest, low awareness of social services, little leisure time, high psychical strenuousness. However, the feelings of satisfaction, certainty and support also played an important role in caring for old people in their home environment. The results may be useful both for students who occupy themselves with problems of intergenerational living together and the old age and also for the general public so that it may realize the difficult situation of caregivers. And last but not least it may be useful for caregivers themselves so that they might be better acquainted with the social services and acquire information about the prevention in the area of mental health...|$|R
40|$|Migration and ageing {{have become}} key topics of the {{contemporary}} world. In the next years, many western countries will be confronted with specific challenges of an ageing society. Among these, the situation of older migrants {{is of particular interest}} in many European countries. Only few studies have, however, focused the relationship quality between adult children and their ageing parents in host national compared to immigrant families. Within this context, expectations of different generations towards one another may be of specific importance. As ageing parents approach a critical period of their life span, they may in general more likely experience a need for <b>intergenerational</b> support and <b>solidarity</b> and develop specific expectations about support exchange. These expectations may be challenged when families migrate from a culture of interdependence to a culture of independence, since cultural contact might lead to core changes in value orientations. As these changes are often more pronounced in the second generation than in the first, a generation gap between ageing parents and their adult children might result out of this process. A major question in this context refers to mutual expectations and obligations between family members of different generations as far as emotional and financial support are concerned. Adult children from immigrant families might, for instance, be subject to the experience of ambivalent or conflictual feelings regarding the desire to become independent from their parents; at the same time, they may feel the urge to conform to parental expectations or to support their parents in accordance to the values of their parents’ culture of origin. However, older parents may also undergo changes in their perception of intergenerational support and lower their expectations in the process of acculturation. In the present study, a cross-cultural comparison between Luxemburgish and Portuguese triads of adult children and their older parents living in Luxembourg (N = 120) will be realized. We will focus on different key issues regarding intergenerational family relations between first and second generations of host nationals and immigrants. One of the main issues will be to examine interdependent and independent self-construals comparing both cultural groups and both generations, presuming that there might be an intergenerational or an acculturation gap. Another research question concerns the potential consequences of divergent expectations about support and solidarity between family members of different generations, such as ambivalent or conflictual feelings. Finally, we will analyse in how far changes in the ideas about intergenerational relations might have affected and be affected by the life-long goal pursuit of older parents of both cultural groups. Results will be discussed within the framework of an integrative model of intergenerational family relations in the light of migration and ageing, which will be presented as a heuristic to explain similarities and differences in adult child-parent relationships by comparing two culturally different groups...|$|R
