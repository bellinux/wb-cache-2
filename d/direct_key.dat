40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy analysis technique for pitch class determination that improves {{the accuracy of}} key finding from audio information. Errors in audio key finding, typically incorrect assignments of closely related keys, commonly result from imprecise pitch class determination and biases introduced {{by the quality of}} the sound. Our technique is motivated by hypotheses on the sources of audio key finding errors, and uses fuzzy analysis to reduce the errors caused by noisy detection of lower pitches, and to refine the biased raw frequency data, in order to extract more correct pitch classes. We compare the proposed system to two others, an earlier one employing only peak detection from FFT results, and another providing <b>direct</b> <b>key</b> finding from MIDI. All three used the same key finding algorithm (Chew’s Spiral Array CEG algorithm) and the same 410 classical music pieces (ranging from Baroque to Contemporary).

When economic reform began, “building up a socialist market economy with specific Chinese characteristics” was the guiding ideology (Zhang 2012 : p 25).

More importantly, the model can be realistically used to determine the physical characteristics of the transported species in a solution from a simple fitting procedure.

40|$|Abstract. Mobile Ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs), providing infrastructure-free wireless instant communication, play {{important role}} in tactical military networks. However, providing security in tactical military MANETs, having very large and dynamic structure without infrastructure support in hostile environments, {{is a very difficult}} task. In order to address security problems in tactical military MANETs, we propose a new HIerarchical MUlti-Tier adaptive ad-hoc network security protocol based on SIgncryption type key exchange Schemes: HIMUTSIS. Our protocol makes contribution to the military MANETs in three major points: Architectural design, cryptographic methods used in military MANETs and key management techniques. Novel architectural design of HIMUT-SIS facilitates certification and key management procedures, provides flexibility and reduces cryptographic workload of the military MANETs. In HIMUTSIS, as a novelty, we offer to use DKEUTS (<b>Direct</b> <b>Key</b> Exchange Using TimeStamp) protocol providing security and performance advantages when compared to some traditional cryptographic methods. Also, multi-security level approach provides adaptive solutions for each layer of the HIMUTSIS. As a key management technique, HIMUTSIS uses hybrid key management approach which reduces rekeying workload of the networks significantly while minimizing single point of failure risk of the military MANET. ...|$|E

If it is valid for environmental resources, it should also be apply to the maintenance of place identity which plays a <b>direct</b> <b>key</b> role in shaping both individual and community identity.

40|$|Research into violent {{extremism}} is lacking integrated theoretical frameworks explaining individual involvement in politically or religiously motivated violence, {{resulting in a}} poor understanding of causal mechanisms. Building on situational action theory, the current study moves beyond the dominant risk factor approach and proposes an integrated model for the explanation of political/religious violence, distinguishing between direct mechanisms and “causes of the causes. ” The model integrates mechanisms from different but complementary traditions. Following previous work, this study focusses on {{the causes of the}} causes influencing <b>direct</b> <b>key</b> mechanisms, violent extremist propensity, and exposure to violent extremist moral settings that explain political/religious violence. The theoretical model is tested using structural equation modelling. The analyses are based on a web survey (N = 6, 020) among adolescents and young adults in Belgium. Results show that violent extremist propensity and exposure to violent extremist moral settings have direct effects on the likelihood of political/religious violence. These direct mechanisms are in turn determined by a series of exogenous factors: perceived injustice and poor social integration. The relationship between perceived injustice and poor social integration and political/religious violence is further mediated by perceived alienation, perceived procedural justice, and religious authoritarianism. The implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for secure communications between two sensor nodes {{is that these}} nodes exclusively share a pairwise key. Although numerous pairwise key establishment (PKE) schemes have been proposed in recent years, {{most of them have}} no guarantee for <b>direct</b> <b>key</b> establishment, no resilience to a large number of node compromises, no resilience to dynamic network topology, or high overhead. To address these limitations, we propose a novel random perturbationbased (RPB) scheme in this paper. The scheme guarantees that any two nodes can directly establish a pairwise key without exposing any secret to other nodes. Even after a large number of nodes have been compromised, the pairwise keys shared by non-compromised nodes remain highly secure. Moreover, the scheme adapts to changes in network topology and incurs low computation and communication overhead. To the best of our knowledge, the RPB scheme {{is the only one that}} provides all these salient features without relying on public key cryptography. Through prototypebased evaluation, we show that the RPB scheme is highly efficient and practical for current generation of sensor nodes. In particular, to support a sensor network with up to 2 16 nodes, establishing a pairwise key of 80 bits between any two 8 -bit, 7. 37 -MHz MICA 2 motes only requires about 0. 13 second of CPU time, 0. 33 KB RAM space, and 15 KB ROM space per node...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disease}} leading to {{accelerated}} aging. Three mutations of the LMNA gene leading to HGPS were identified. The more frequent ones, c. 1824 C>T and c. 1822 G>A, enhance {{the use of the}} intron 11 progerin 5 splice site (5 SS) instead of the LMNA 5 SS, leading to the production of the truncated dominant negative progerin. The less frequent c. 1868 C>G mutation creates a novel 5 SS (LA 35 5 SS), inducing the production of another truncated LMNA protein (LA 35). Our data show that the progerin 5 SS is used at low yield in the absence of HGPS mutation, whereas utilization of the LA 35 5 SS is dependent upon the presence of the c. 1868 C>G mutation. In the perspective to correct HGPS splicing defects, we investigated whether SR proteins can modify the relative yields of utilization of intron 11 5 SSs. By in cellulo and in vitro assays, we identified SRSF 5 as a <b>direct</b> <b>key</b> regulator increasing the utilization of the LMNA 5 SS {{in the presence of the}} HGPS mutations.
