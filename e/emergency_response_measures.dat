40|$|Assessed how {{accountable}} {{emergency service}} organisations and the Departments of Health & Human Services (DHHS) and Justice & Regulation (DJR) are for their response time performance. Summary The audit assessed how accountable emergency service organisations and the Departments of Health & Human Services (DHHS) and Justice & Regulation (DJR) are for their response time performance. We {{found that while}} response time performance has been largely stable across the last three years, multiple problems with <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> time <b>measures,</b> targets and data prevent Parliament and the public from holding agencies fully to account. Response time targets are outdated or not based on evidence or a clear rationale; agencies were often unable to explain the basis for their target times to arrive at an emergency. Reporting the percentage of cases that meet a target lacking evidence or rationale fails to describe agency performance in any meaningful way. <b>Response</b> time <b>measures</b> do not cover {{the full range of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>responses.</b> Some agencies exclude significant numbers of <b>emergency</b> <b>responses,</b> while others include lesser priority responses. Despite some weaknesses in how response time data is recorded and reported, public reports accurately represent actual performance in most instances.   However, external reports do not have enough information to allow readers to understand response time performance. DHHS and DJR have not appropriately reviewed <b>response</b> time <b>measures</b> to identify and address these issues. Although response times are a relevant part of performance measurement frameworks for emergency service delivery, they are not appropriate stand-alone measures for overall emergency service performance, and should be considered alongside information on outcomes, service quality, efficiency and cost effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose ‐ This paper aims to {{determine}} the influence of physical ability on initial <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance among <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> teams. Design/methodology/approach ‐ In an emergency incident, emergency responders are involved in vigorous physical activities. Previous attempts have demonstrated that job performance of emergency responders depends a great deal on their ability to perform strenuous physical activity. This paper examines the influence of physical ability namely weight, height, and cardiovascular endurance on <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance among fire fighting teams in Malaysia. <b>Emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance was defined as team member's speed in responding to emergency situations. Data on team member's physical ability and <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> time were collected for the duration of five months. The distance from the waiting room to the fire truck in each selected fire station was used to measure performance. Findings ‐ This study found that the team with higher average weight and cardiovascular endurance level had better initial <b>response</b> to <b>emergency</b> situations, contrary to the research hypothesis. But it is speculated that the relationship could be further understood by considering the proportion of fat in the body. The relationship between cardiovascular endurance and initial <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance further validates and justifies the use of physical fitness test as a criterion for job performance of fire fighters. Originality/value ‐ This paper offers empirical evidence of <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance in Malaysia. Specifically, it presents findings on the influence of physical ability <b>measures</b> on initial <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance from a team perspective. In addition, the <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> performance was <b>measured</b> by the distance traveled by the responders, which serves as a meaningful performance indicator...|$|R

The NRC defines defense in depth as creating multiple independent, and redundant, layers of protection, and response, to failures, accidents, or fires in power plants. For example, defense in depth means that if one fire suppression system fails, there will be another to back it up. The idea is that no single layer, no matter how robust, is exclusively relied upon; access controls, physical barriers, redundant and diverse key safety functions, and <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>measures</b> are used.
