5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a <b>general</b> <b>practice</b> among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work.

40|$|Advances in {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) and increased availability of routinely collected data {{have the potential}} to contribute to public health and health services research. The aim of this feasibility study was to explore the use of GIS to measure access to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> and its relationship to selected antenatal behaviours. The researchers obtained the Perinatal Data Collection, 2004 − 2008, for South Western Sydney Local Health District from the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Using a GIS, they generated circular and polygon-based 1 km and 2 km road network buffers from a maternal residential address and then calculated the number of <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> within those buffers (density measures). Distances to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> from maternal residences were also calculated in the GIS as another measure of geographic access to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> (proximity measures). They used generalised estimating equations logistic regression to examine associations between access to <b>general</b> <b>practices,</b> and smoking during pregnancy and late first antenatal visit. They found that the numbers of <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> within circular buffers were significantly greater than within polygon-based road network buffers. The average distance to the five closest <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> from a mother’s residence was 2. 3  km ±  3. 0  km. For two of the five measures of access, a higher number of <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> was associated with increased risk for late first antenatal visit. However, the associations were weak, with odds ratios very close to unity. Choice of metrics of geographic access to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> did not alter the associations with smoking during pregnancy or late first antenatal visit. The study showed that {{geographic information}} systems can be used to quantify measures of geographic access to health services for public health and health services research. Geographic access to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> was generally not associated with smoking during pregnancy or late first antenatal visit. The researchers concluded that GIS and routinely collected health data can be used to answer novel questions in public health and health services research...|$|R
40|$|<b>General</b> medical <b>practices</b> {{providing}} primary {{health care}} are the primary source for seeking medical advice in society. Government incentives and the urge to keep up-todate with current trends have led to massive deployment of technology in <b>General</b> <b>Practices.</b> Whilst this technology has enormously benefited the profession, it has also seen sundry forms of security breaches. The lack of appropriate reporting mechanisms in Australia has prompted this research. A qualitative research methodology with an online questionnaire was used. A random selection of <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> in Western Australia was invited to participate. The results of the research, whilst preliminary, revealed that <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> lack appropriate monitoring protocols for security breaches. Current security guidelines provided to <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> are not enough to ensure the security of patient records. The introduction of mandatory reporting may alleviate this situation and create improvement in information security in the medical domain...|$|R

5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a <b>general</b> <b>practice</b> among the physicians of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a <b>general</b> <b>practice</b> among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} is known to vary between countries, districts and <b>general</b> <b>practices.</b> The influence of early detection and screening on the variation of prevalence between <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> has not previously been investigated. AIM: To test {{the hypothesis that the}} {{prevalence of}} type 2 diabetes is associated with awareness of and screening for diabetes within <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> and to explore other factors that may explain the variation in prevalence between practices. DESIGN OF STUDY: Cross-sectional study of <b>general</b> <b>practices.</b> SETTING: Forty-two <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> in Newcastle and North Tyneside; 20 % random sample of patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 1056). METHOD: Factors thought {{to be associated with the}} variation of type 2 diabetes prevalence were collected from <b>general</b> <b>practices</b> through practice managers, medical records, and patient questionnaire. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to quantify the association, and variables significant at the 5 % level were entered into a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: There was a wide inter-practice variation in age/sex standardised type 2 diabetes prevalence (range = 0. 69 % to 2. 73 %; P < 0. 001). There was no significant association between the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the proportion of patients detected outside primary care or the proportion of patients detected through screening, accounting for only 2 % and 3 % of the variation in type 2 prevalence between practices, respectively. The mean Townsend deprivation score accounted for 42 % of the variation in type 2 diabetes prevalence between practices, with more deprived practices having a higher prevalence. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that socieconomic deprivation, rather than detection through screening or awareness of diabetes, accounts for much of the variation in prevalence of type 2 diabetes between practices...|$|R
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The <b>general</b> <b>practice</b> during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
