50|$|The Clarke-Palmore House, {{also known}} as Clarke Home, was built as a brick {{farmhouse}} in 1819 and expanded in 1855. Its first floor level, built in 1819, is described as being American bond brickwork of 3 to 5 stretcher courses between each <b>header</b> <b>course.</b> Its upper level, built in 1855, is of American bond with 6 to 7 stretcher courses between each <b>header</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
50|$|Below {{the water}} table the brick is laid in common bond; above it is {{switches}} to English bond, with the <b>header</b> <b>course</b> every sixth row. Buttresses with stone trim divide the bays, four on the north facade and five on the south. Each bay has a Gothic-arched stained-glass window with stone surround.|$|E
50|$|The Moran has {{a two-part}} exterior: load-bearing, masonry frame {{consisting}} of concrete masonry units with a brick <b>header</b> <b>course</b> every two rows, and a brick veneer laid {{in a common}} bond with seventh course header rows. Some bricks have detached and some are delaminating. The tall northerly block of the Moran is distinguished by not only its height, {{but also by the}} remains of a massive exterior steel boiler structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stonework}} has alternating stretcher and <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> i.e. {{one layer}} of rectangular stones is laid lengthwise, {{and the next}} layer has the ends facing outwards ...|$|R
50|$|Beckers Block is a {{group of}} {{historic}} commercial buildings in Huntsville, Alabama. The two-story, five-bay structure was built in 1925. Each bay is separated by piers that project above the roofline. The center of each bay is raised above the parapet, creating a crenelated appearance. Below the parapet, a rectangular panel is formed from <b>header</b> <b>courses.</b> Cream-colored square stones decorate the entire façade.|$|R
5000|$|The 1923 {{addition}} reflected changing school design {{from that}} era, while it attempted {{to match the}} lines and design of the original building. [...] It was slightly shorter and had an identical elevation plan. Its main differences was yellow brick that was used above the foundation level, and it had six-window bands that {{ran the length of}} each floor of the building. The rear wall of the addition replicated the rear wall of the original building {{with the exception of the}} entrance at ground level, both of the three window sets were vertically aligned, and corner pilasters were added. Rowlock <b>courses</b> and <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> were employed to outline the plain wall masses on either side of the shallow rear pavilion.|$|R
50|$|A {{decorative}} iron arch {{containing the}} words BOWEN PARK springs from freestanding painted concrete piers {{to form the}} main entrance to the Park. A freestanding pier {{to the north and}} south form narrower entrance ways.The toilet block on the Bowen Bridge Road boundary is a small single- storey loadbearing brick structure with a tiled roof with a timber battened soffit. It sits on a base of face brick finishing at a <b>header</b> <b>course</b> of dark bricks. The upper portion of the external walls is finished in a roughcast cement render. The entrance to the male section is to the north and to the female side is entered from the south.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{concrete}} steps with flagstone insets, partially {{covered by a}} wooden wheelchair ramp, lead to the front entrance. It consists of double wooden doors with a cast stone surround surmounted by a glass panel above the doors with [...] "CONGREGATION BETH DAVID" [...] reverse painted in gold letters on a black background. It is flanked by two sconces and tall, narrow round arched windows with a <b>header</b> <b>course</b> of bricks and cast stone lintels. Above the door is a wider round-arched double window with a blind transom and brick arch surround. Cast stone impost blocks engage a horizontal stringer course of brick in a basket-weave pattern that also engages the similar cast stone capitals on the pilasters. A gold-colored Star of David is in the gable field.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{contributing}} {{resources on the}} property. The meeting house itself {{is located at the}} southeast corner, with the cemetery taking up the north and west. Behind the meeting house are a garage and shed, both modern and non-contributing, with a contributing well and pumphouse closer to the cemetery. In front of it is a sundial, a contributing object. A fence with brick entrance gates runs along Route 343. The meeting house is a two-and-a-half-story four-bay structure with load-bearing brick and masonry walls on a stone foundation topped with a gabled roof pierced by brick chimneys at either end. Outside dimensions are 43' 8" [...] (524 in) wide by 60' 5" [...] (725 in) long and 35' 1½" [...] (421.5 in) tall. The walls are 22¾" [...] (22.75 in) thick. The bricks are laid with two stretcher course and one <b>header</b> <b>course</b> with half-inch (13 mm) joints of the original lime mortar.|$|E
50|$|It {{is the end}} {{sections}} of the tunnel that have taken {{the brunt of the}} storm water runoff impacts over the years, which may have affected the structural integrity of the tunnel. It is unknown what the condition of the original tunnel form-work behind the brick arch is, and how potential deterioration may have impacted the condition of the tunnel. The 2002 assessment considered that the first 35 feet of the tunnel from the west portal, and the first 25 feet from the east portal were heavily distressed. Cracking through the brick and significant loss of face brick was prevalent these areas. The lack of bonder or <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> of brick had allowed for significant delamination of the face brick away from the backing courses. Water infiltration was thought to be the primary cause of this deterioration.|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} in the tunnel are reportedly all of Vermont origin. The portals were constructed of hammer-dressed limestone from the Isle La Motte. The interior brick of the tunnel were obtained from a factory from {{the north side of}} Mallets Bay and the mortar was made with lime from Weathersfield, Vermont. Construction appears to be robust as the walls are reportedly four feet thick and the arch two feet thick. The bricks are arranged in a running bond pattern. It is noted during the site inspection the lack of bonder or <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> of brick, at least at the surface course of brick. The limestone foundation is exposed along the base of the tunnel as it protrudes above the track bed elevation approximately eight inches and away from the brick masonry arch by approximately eight inches.|$|R
50|$|The bricks are not laid by {{an expert}} {{bricklayer}} which {{is indicated by}} an irregular variation of the <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> from 4 rows apart to 12 between the stretcher rows. The mortar is quite hard and struck {{in the same way}} consistent with a building in Abbott Street built the late 1880s. The southern wall runs back from the front to the back past the main roof at a similar height but becomes a parapet end to the skillion roof. The hand made bricks are in all brick elevations, the side rear and front of the shops and in the parapet section over the skillion at the back. The place shows an early construction method with the wall top plate for the roof tied down with hoop iron straps which come down from the outside and are built into the mortar course two brick courses down.|$|R
50|$|The Boscawen Academy was {{a private}} school {{chartered}} {{by the state of}} New Hampshire in 1827 as part of a general plan to improve secondary education. This two story Federal style brick building was constructed in 1827-28 by William Abbot, a local joiner who also built a number of other civic buildings in central New Hampshire. The brick exterior is laid in common bond, with a <b>header</b> <b>course</b> every eight rows. It has a low pitch gable roof whose pedimented end, above the front facade, has a fanlight window. The front facade is three bays wide, with a central door topped by a fanlight transom. The side walls are four bays long; the first window on each side has been bricked over, apparently as part of 19th century alterations to the stairwells inside. Centered above the front entry is a two-stage tower: it has a square base, above which is an open belfry supported by four posts and surrounded by a balustrade. The tower is topped by a four-sided cupola and weathervane.|$|E
5000|$|Cone LibraryApart from {{residence}} halls, the Cone Library is {{the first}} single purpose academic building constructed on campus. [...] Raymond Whitaker designed the building that was constructed by H. George Schloemer in 1958 for $250,000. The 186 by 40 ft Modern structure follows an irregular rectangular plan and is dominated by large plate glass windows. The main facade of the building is divided into eight bays with the main entrance just off center. The entrance bay is set off by stone. The building's mottled red face brick is laid in American bond with a <b>header</b> <b>course</b> on every sixth course. Another dominate feature of the building are the deep eaves that overhang the walls. Along {{the upper part of}} the wall is a wide band of stone. The window lintels are likewise stone. There are also three basement level windows in each bay, save for the entrance bay. The east side of the south elevation is composed of solid brick with no windows. It features a decorative cut stone design that portrays Marycrest's insignia that is embedded in the wall. It was created by Sister Mary Clarice Ebert, CHM who taught in the college's art department. The front section of the main level of the interior was divided into three large rooms. They were separated by wood and glass panel walls. The periodical reading room was on the north, the main desk and card catalog was in the center, and the reference reading room was on the south. The stacks were located across the back of the building. The basement originally housed the student union in the south half and an audio-visual room, alumnae office, and receiving room on the north. [...] Walsh HallRaymond Whitaker was already in retirement when he designed Walsh Hall with the assistance of Kenneth Wagner. It was completed in 1964 by O. Jorgensen & Sons of Clinton for $650,000. [...] The four-story structure housed science classrooms and laboratories. The 162 by 72 ft building follows a rectangular plan with its main facade on the west elevation. The exterior brick is laid in American bond with a <b>header</b> <b>course</b> set between every fifth course. Parapet walls capped with stone rise above a flat roof. Brick piers separate the bays. The main facade is five bays while the side elevations are eight bays. The west elevation is composed of the main entrance in the center bay with windows similar to others found in the building above it. The center bay is flanked by two bays with a single column of windows centered in the bay. There is a combination of single, paired and triple window units in the building. The east elevation features window groupings similar to those found on the north elevation. The south elevation features an unusual arrangement of windows and stone panels that form a cross in the center bay. The clustered window groups have stone sills, frames and mullions. The stone beltcourses on each floor double as window lintels.|$|E
40|$|In the {{historic}} buildings built with face brick tile {{it is very}} common to have copings and cornices of soldier or <b>header</b> <b>course,</b> made with the same brick as the facade and these bricks are usually more deteriorated {{than the rest of}} the facade. The cause of the deterioration is the action of the water combined with dirt, vegetation, and other moisture-related causes. One of the possible systems to conserve and protect these elements is by projecting a water repellent. This article will present the results of tests conducted on laboratory specimens formed by low brick walls with and without the application of a waterproofing treatment, finished off at the top part by a sloping course also of brick...|$|E
50|$|The Bartlett {{building}} is a one story, masonry building with tan brick walls. The main entrance features an arch, which is the base to a two-story tower. It has a poured concrete foundation. The tower has iron railings and green wood trim. The main section has a flat roof with a rubber membrane, masked by a hipped skirt roofs on the parapets. This skirt roof is covered in green terra-cotta tile. The tower has a pyramidal hip roof covered in same green tile. It faces east onton Broadway, the main north-south road in the town. The Southshore, Chicago and South Bend Railway station is, leading from the interurban station to the Lake Michigan beach. It is a tripartite composition of two large storefront bays, flanking the arched central entrance tower. The sand-colored brick walls were laid {{with a variety of}} patterns: there is a soldier course around the foundation and above all storefront openings, and <b>header</b> <b>courses</b> for storefront sills (photo 3). At the front corners of the building, two large square piers extend into the parapet and interrupt the tiled roofs. These have slightly recessed vertical panels with basketweave brickwork - three vertical bricks alternating with three horizontal. The large, two pane plate glass storefront windows themselves were installed in 1995, to replicate the original configuration.|$|R

40|$|Chapparu is an {{innovative}} practice borne out of adversity {{to cope with}} a wide variety of brick sizes to build walls of a given width. It is also the name given to mortar that is applied on the side of a brick on the <b>header</b> <b>course</b> to make the sides appear flat-as-a-plate when single-brick thick walls are built using the English bond. Moreover, it is also a type of joint which holds the bricks together. Such brickwork may be labelled as 'chapparu brickwork'. Output characteristics of such brickwork are studied with respect to variations in brick and joint sizes using a simulation methodology. Simulation trials are undertaken using output rates of macro-activities established using the activity sampling and the synthesis techniques to establish rates and rates for 'three scenarios', viz. fastest and the slowest rates of working including an average rate. Brickwork output under different combinations of study variables are predicted by selecting a 'representative-unit' of brickwork in five randomly chosen walls for which purpose volume of mortar in different joints of the representative-unit and the number of bricks had to predicted using a separately validated model. Micro-activity rates were then used to build up the time taken for each course of brickwork and thereby predict the time taken for building a wall of a specific size. Hourly outputs were so calculated repeating the simulation for the 'three scenarios' as necessary. A general specification for increasing hourly output is developed using such analyses which recommends the use of large bed joints and taller bricks, in addition to smaller (or no) vertical joints adopting a flexible approach to lap requirements and joint sizes, including the use of under filled or unfilled vertical joints. Moreover, in order to minimise the negative impact of chapparu, it recommends smaller chapparu joints (< 10 - 12 mm) as the impact on output is insignificant at such values when current methods of construction are used. Nevertheless, it is noted that increase in output may not necessarily translates to savings in cost. The simulation methodology developed under this study is a versatile approach for evaluating different scenarios when compared with regression models. It can also be used for evaluating new methods of construction with relative ease. It is expected that this first time study would clear common understandings surrounding chapparu brickwork thereby exploring new opportunities through a non-standardisation route!...|$|E

50|$|Further {{dendrochronology}} {{performed in}} the roof structure indicated that significant changes {{were made to the}} building between 1767 and 1768. These changes include; extending the dwelling on the east by 6 ft and on the west by 12 ft, extending the loft to a full story across the south facade only, the addition of two outward flanking chimney stacks, encasing the south facing facade with brick nogging and a veneer brick, adding 16/16 common sliding sash windows of the first floor and 9/9 common sliding sash windows on the second floor. The veneer brick and addition of solid masonry were set in an artful Flemish bond pattern with glazed <b>headers,</b> queen <b>course</b> and oyster shell lime mortar with a grapevine joint. During this expansion it is assumed that the northward ell was not modified, however this portion of the building was removed in a subsequent renovation likely to have occurred circa 1897.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primitive}} Federal I-house with Greek Revival details is {{a two-story}} masonry {{house with a}} gable roof and a rear masonry ell extension off of the west front room. On {{the east side of}} the ell was a [...] porch. The porch was enclosed as a kitchen and a bedroom addition was built northeast side of the home between 1925 and 1931. Arnold Weidler who lived in the home during the construction provided this information to the author. The entire structure, both exterior and interior walls are of three brick thick common bond brick walls including a brick foundation and cellar. The structure prior to 1925 had only one timber-framed wall. That wall is the partition wall of the front foyer/stairwell, which divides the west front room from the foyer. In 1925 when the porch was enclosed the walls were framed with standard 2x4 wood studs 16 inches OC. The framed edition of 1925 was extended 8 feet in 1995 to meet the garage that was built on the property in 1993. The front elevation has 10 symmetrical openings on the first and second floors, five windows on the second story and two windows on each side of the front door. The lintels and sills are all limestone in the masonry structure. The replacement windows are six-over-six double hung units matching identically the original wood window intact in {{the east side of the}} masonry ell. This window in the east side of the masonry ell is one of six windows with rough-hewn wood lintels and sills. The other four are the attic windows. In addition are two small single pane cellar windows with two brick window wells. The three panel walnut front door has a three-pane transom ventilation window. The 7/12-pitched roof was originally shake shingles and is now finished in asphalt shingles with large flush end chimneys. The large wooden soffit has a massive decorative cornice that is consistent in size and presentation on the masonry walls as well as the wood framed walls on all elevations of the home. Common Bond is an arrangement of four to six stretcher <b>courses</b> between single <b>header</b> <b>courses.</b>|$|R

The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement {{at the beginning of}} the course, and duly closing the bond.|$|R

25|$|Raking {{courses in}} monk bond may—for instance—be {{staggered}} {{in such a}} way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of <b>courses</b> with back-and-forth <b>header</b> staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next <b>course</b> up, a <b>header</b> is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the <b>header</b> in the <b>course</b> below, and then in the third <b>course,</b> a <b>header</b> is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.|$|R
500|$|Yoram Tsafrir has {{attempted}} to place the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure. Tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure's eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction. North of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large ashlar blocks. These blocks have faces with drafted margins around a prominent boss and are laid in homogeneous <b>header</b> and stretcher <b>courses,</b> one above the other. This style of construction is Hellenistic and distinct from the Herodian construction apparent south of the seam. Although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain, Tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the Acra's foundations which were later incorporated into Herod the Great's extension of the Temple platform. As further proof, Tzafrir also points to significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam, {{including the use of}} trapezoid-shaped stones, with the methods employed in the Seleucid city of Perga in Asia Minor. 1 Macabees 1:30 attributes construction of the Acra to Apollonius, AntiochusIII's [...] "chief collector" [...] ( [...] , Sar Hamissim), which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief ( [...] , Sar) of the Mysians, a people of Asia Minor.|$|R
