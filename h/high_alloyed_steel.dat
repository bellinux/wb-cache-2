40|$|Being {{the single}} {{component}} transferring load and traction from {{the vehicle to}} the rail, the selection of materials and structural properties of railway wheels are critical. Carbon steel with a pearlitic microstructure is {{the most commonly used}} material due to its high strength, low cost and good wear properties. However, due to the two‐phase microstructure, pearlite is susceptible to softening at higher temperatures and degradation of mechanical properties. A new type of wheel steels with increased alloying content of silicon and manganese has shown improved resistance to rolling contact fatigue. However, a clear correlation between increased alloying content and strength and how the softening behaviour of the material affects the fatigue properties have not been studied so far. To foster further knowledge on these issues, two wheel steels were used in this work: a high Si‐Mn alloyed steel and a widely used lower alloyed steel. In virgin states the two selected steels were found to have fairly similar mechanical characteristics {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and different strain rates. Upon annealing, however, both materials begin to soften at temperatures above 500 °C. Higher temperatures approaching the ferrite‐austenite transformation temperature (about 750 °C) accelerates the microstructural degeneration. However the high Si‐Mn‐alloyed steel showed to have a better resistance against thermal softening, resulting in better mechanical properties and increased fatigue life compared to the low alloyed steel. Investigation of the microstructure revealed that the softening was caused by spheroidisation of cemenite lamellas in pearlite. Heavy pre‐deformation before annealing emphasised this degeneration of pearlite even more. Both silicon and manganese are considered to retard the softening towards higher annealing times and temperatures, by a decrease in carbon flux, which thereby limit the spheroidisation rate. The cementite spheroidisation leads to lowering of hardness, monotonic and cyclic strength and fatigue life times. As the <b>high</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> resists microstructural degeneration better at elevated temperatures it retains the mechanical properties better after high temperature exposure. This is particularly evident for the fatigue performance. As an example it can be mentioned that a certain high temperature exposure leads to hardness decrease of about 20 % for the <b>high</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel,</b> while the low alloyed steel suffers a hardness reduction of about 25 %. For fatigue life times, however, the difference between the two materials is as much as a factor three in favour for the higher alloyed steel...|$|E

The widely used iterative method of Oliver and Pharr was unsuccessful in the attempts to analyze machine compliance and indenter area function. Therefore, an alternative procedure was adopted. The alternative procedure is based on the ratio between maximum load and unload stiffness squared, Pm/Su². It was found that this procedure, which is not iterative, gives good results. A careful study of the Pm/Su² ratio, lead us to conclude that the Fischercope machine has a low compliance which depends on the sample mounting. This low compliance in conjunction with the recent discovery of the dependence of beta factor on the tip roundness/maximum depth ratio, which appears in the relation between contact stiffness and contact area, explains why the iterative method does not converge.

Conventional procedures like spark discharge optical emission spectrometry or x-ray fluorescence are subject to limitations concerning sensitivity or sample preparation that can be overcome by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). To realise a hand-held spectroscopy system laser source and measuring probe should both be connected via an optical fibre. A fibre laser is particularly suited for this purpose since, this way, the extensive and error-prone coupling of the laser light into a transport fibre is dropped. In this thesis a fibre laser based LIBS procedure is developed and evaluated. For this purpose, issues like ablation, single pulse behaviour or effects of the repetition rate {{on the results of}} the analysis are being investigated. A comparison of the analytical capabilities performed with commercial hand-held analysers for aluminium and steel shows that similar values can be achieved in much shorter measuring times of less than 10 s compared to 25 - 150 s.

40|$|The current ongoing {{evolution}} towards mass customization, {{resulting in}} the production of small lots or prototypes and single unique items, requires a different strategy compared to classic high volume manufacturing. In order to deal with the increasing product range and decreasing time to market, the flexibility of current manufacturing process chain needs to increase. A conventional manufacturing process of a high quality component consists of an initial machining step, for example a milling and/or turning operation, starting from bulk material (block, cylinder). In a next step, the part is unclamped, transported to a heat treatment facility in order to attain the required material properties (hardness, residual surface stresses, microstructure,…). This step introduces inevitably deformations to the component, which is why a finishing operation is performed after the component is transported, re-clamped and re-aligned. In this PhD thesis 2 alterations to this conventional process flow are investigated. A first innovation investigated in this thesis, is combining the machining, heat treatment and if required a hard finishing operation in 1 single machine and setup. This omits the need for logistics {{back and forth to the}} hardening facility. Re-clamping and re-aligning of the component is no longer needed for the hard finishing operation, which reduces the total lead time and errors introduced during these labor intensive operations. This is realized by integrating a laser into a machining center, allowing to perform both the machining operations as the heat treatment in one setup. In this thesis, 2 different setups are developed and described. The first setup, uses a 500 W Nd:Yag laser as a heat source. A fixed spot optical design is made using basic optics calculus and is updated using ray tracing simulation. A mechanical design is made and realized. The integration of the laser as a tool is done into a 5 -axis milling machine. A spotsize of 1. 2 mm diameter or more (if out of focus) is moved across the surface of the component by moving the machine’s axis. The process of integrated laser hardening is investigated on C 45 steel by performing a Design of Experiment, using 3 different feed rates and 4 different spotsizes. High hardness values, above 750 HV and a hardening depth of about 0. 2 mm are achieved. Thanks to the high cooling rate during the heat cycle in laser hardening, the hardness exceeds hardness values achieved by conventional hardening techniques. A second design of experiment, investigating multiple laser tracks next to each other, in order to cover a larger area, is performed. From these experiments, it is concluded it is impossible, no matter what overlap/inter-track distance is used, to achieve a uniform hardness along the cross section of multiple scan tracks. This effect is identified as a tempering/softening effect, in which the second track tempers a part of the first track. Finally, a die and mold component, prone to rapid wear, made of a <b>high</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel,</b> is laser hardened using the developed setup, proving the industrial relevance of this work. In order to achieve a uniform hardness across a larger area, a new setup is developed on a 11 -axis machining center. Instead of using a fixed spot hardening strategy as in the previous setup, a very small spot (0. 8 mm in diameter) is scanned across the surface at high speed using a rotating mirror, while moving slowly in the feed direction by moving the machine’s axis. The optical and mechanical design and realization of this setup are described. A control system, controlling laser source (500 W diode laser), mirror actuator and auxiliary equipment, while monitoring the actual temperature and machine position, is developed. A software tool which allows to program the hardening operation of complex shaped components, is developed and the strategy is illustrated on an example. The process of integrated scanning laser hardening is investigated on a low alloyed steel (C 45) and a highly alloyed steel (40 CrMnMo 7). The samples showed no tempering effects, resulting in a uniform hardness across the scan width. The robustness of the process and control is verified by testing contaminated samples (oil, steel/aluminum chips, emulsion) and samples with varying scanning width. Two cases are described as an example of industrial applications for this technology. The second innovation tackles the machining of near net shapes, which is significantly different to machining from bulk material. In this thesis, 2 types of near net shape machining are investigated: the machining of gears from forgings and the finishing of large assemblies built by additive manufacturing. The machining of gears using the conventional processes requires dedicated, design specific tools. The lead time and cost of these tools are high, which is an issue for prototypes and small batch production. Three different alternative production technologies are investigated. A multi-axis milling strategy using standard end mills is developed and an automotive gearbox gear is made to high quality grinding specifications in less than 24 hours, while the lead time for conventional production is in the order of 13 weeks. This machining process is ideal to combine with the integrated laser hardening. Since the distortions introduced by laser hardening are limited, a hard finishing operation might be omitted, resulting in a hardened high accuracy gear manufactured in hours/days instead of weeks. The finishing of large assemblies, built using additive manufactured components, to a very high accuracy is quite different to machining a small component from bulk to the same accuracy. By investigating and reducing errors introduced by CAD/CAM, machining, in-machine mounting (clamping and aligning) and machine condition (position accuracy, flatness table and thermal stability), the achieved tolerance is reduced significantly. This is verified on a demonstrator part. nrpages: 254 status: publishe...|$|E

The results showed that boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> attained yield and tensile strength values of about 650 - 1370 MPa and 850 - 2000 MPa, respectively, while those related to non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> were, in order, about 600 - 1100 MPa and 900 - 1400 MPa. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
