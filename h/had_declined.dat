An unofficial population count by the Washington Secretary of State in 1956 estimated that the town had 516 residents, but after the 1957 dis-incorporation vote, the town's population was reduced to 225 by 1958. The town was the smallest incorporated place in King County for most of its existence.|$|E

Trends in sulfate and elemental carbon (EC) particle concentrations {{over the period}} 1982 – 1993 are consistent with this overall improvement in air quality and help to confirm {{some of the reasons}} for the changes that are seen. Fine particle sulfate concentrations <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> as a strict sulfur ox-ides (SOx) emission control program adopted in 1978 was implemented over time. Fine particle elemental (black) carbon concentrations <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> over a period when newer diesel engines and improved diesel fuels have been introduced into the vehicle fleet.

5|$|General sejm was {{the highest}} organ of {{collective}} and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases. During {{the second half of}} the 17th century, for a variety of reasons, including abuse of the unanimity rule (liberum veto), sejm's effectiveness <b>had</b> <b>declined,</b> and the void was being increasingly filled by sejmiks, where in practice the bulk of government's work was getting done.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{population}} of Gigha peaked at over 600, but <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> to just under 400 by {{the close of the}} 19th century. After half of millennium of association, the MacNeills sold the isle for £49,000 to James Williams Scarlett, a nephew of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger in 1865. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel William James Scarlett built the mansion house of Achamore and Gigha remained in the family's hands until 1919.|$|E

With the return of the Partisans to Serbia proper, the SDS began to incur serious casualties. For example, between 15 March and 15 August 1944, the SDS lost 157 men killed, 107 wounded and 26 missing. By August 1944, SDS units were responding to Mihailović's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks.|$|E

5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register <b>have</b> <b>declined.</b> This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools <b>has</b> <b>declined,</b> largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|R
