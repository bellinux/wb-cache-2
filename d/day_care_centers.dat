5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers,</b> preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

40|$|Background Child <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> is an {{institution}} functioning {{to help families}} to fulfil their child's need by providing stimulation with educative game instrument (EGI) while they work outside home. Objectives To evaluate motor development of children at child <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> with EGI stimulation {{compared with that of}} children without stimulation. Methods An experimental study using pretest-posttest control group design was cartied out on children aged 2 to 5 years old, at Islamic <b>Center</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center</b> (without EGI) and Tanah-Besi <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center</b> in Tebing Tinggi (with EGI for six months). Inclusion criteria: healthy, well-nourished children aged 2 to 5 years with informed consent, no developmental delay (confirmed by Denver-II developmental screening test). Exclusion criteria: pre term birth children. Forty subjects were selected by means of simple random sampling. Research data were taken with Cronbach's motor skills scale. Subjects consisted of 3 to 4 years old children, mostly four years old. Results Motor skills scores (mean; SD) of the Islamic <b>Center</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center</b> group and Tanah-Besi <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center</b> group before stimulation were 104. 9; 10. 37 and 104. 7; 5. 47 (P= 0. 923), respectively, and after stimulation 105. 2; 9. 56 and 135. 3; 7. 67 (P< 0. 001), respectively. Motor skills scores (mean; SD) of Tanah-Besi <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Center</b> group before and after stimulation were 104. 7; 5. 4 7 and 135. 3; 7. 67 (P< 0. 001) respectively.

25|$|Sadoveanu's {{literary}} and political change became {{known to the}} general public in March 1945, when he lectured about Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at a conference hall in Bucharest. Part of a conference cycle, his speech was famously titled Lumina vine de la Răsărit, which soon became synonymous with the attempts to improve the image of Stalinism in Romania. ARLUS would issue the text of his conference as a printed volume later in the year. Also in 1945, Sadoveanu journeyed to the Soviet Union together with some of his fellow ARLUS members—among them biologists Parhon and Săvulescu, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, linguist Iorgu Iordan, and mathematician Simion Stoilow. Invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to attend the 220th anniversary of its foundation, they also visited research institutes, kolhozy, and <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers,</b> notably meeting with Nikolay Tsitsin, an agronomist favored by Stalin. After his return, he wrote other controversial texts and gave lectures which offered ample praise to the Soviet system. That year, the ARLUS enterprise Editura Cartea Rusă also published his translation of Ivan Turgenev's A Sportsman's Sketches.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in New York City in July 1969. [...] The results were [...] "generally very positive"; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over the full hour. [...] However, {{the researchers found that}} although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the [...] "Street" [...] segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.|$|E

The researchers found that children learned from the shows, that the show's appeal was high, and that children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, they found that, although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered when there were only humans on screen. The producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As {{a result of this}} decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than they would have liked, so the show's producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers and show the human and Muppet characters together. Lesser called this decision [...] "a turning point in the history of Sesame Street". [...] Muppet creator Jim Henson and his coworkers created Muppets for Sesame Street that could interact with the human actors, and many segments were re-shot.|$|E
