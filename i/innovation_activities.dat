The results concerning fostering factors for forest holdings to introduce successful innovations indicate the necessity ofcooperation, information exchange and the support of public and EU sources.

40|$|While radical product {{innovations}} represent significant {{engines of}} firm growth, questions remain over whether marketing helps or hurts (1) a firm's radical product <b>innovation</b> <b>activity</b> and (2) its rewards from radical product <b>innovation</b> <b>activity.</b> By attaching an attention-based {{view of the}} firm to a market-based assets view of marketing, this paper examines the role of three marketing resources—market knowledge, reputation, and relational resources—on radical <b>innovation</b> <b>activity.</b> Our conceptual framework posits differentiated effects among marketing resources as antecedents of radical <b>innovation</b> <b>activity</b> and as moderators of its impact on firms' financial performance. Using a survey of a broad set of high-tech business-to-business (B 2 B) firms to test hypotheses, {{it is found that}} firms with strong relational resources enjoy a higher propensity for, and stronger financial rewards from, radical <b>innovation</b> <b>activity.</b> Reputational resources come with a trade-off as they hurt the incidence of radical innovation but enhance its financial rewards.
