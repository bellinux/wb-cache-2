5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{fighting}} manpower, Southern Rhodesia's main contribution to World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trenches of the Western Front. As the white Southern Rhodesians in this theatre joined the British Army separately, {{at different times}} and under their own steam (or were already connected to specific units as reservists), they were spread across dozens of regiments, including the Black Watch, the Coldstream Guards, the Grenadier Guards, the Royal Engineers and the Royal Marines, {{as well as many}} South African units and others. During the war's opening months, Southern Rhodesian volunteers who could not afford to travel to England were assisted by a private fund set up by Ernest Lucas Guest, a Salisbury lawyer and Anglo-Boer War veteran who also organised an accompanying recruitment campaign for European service. Guest stopped recruiting at the Company's request after it created the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, an expeditionary force to South and South-West Africa, in October 1914.|$|E
25|$|At {{the funeral}} itself, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> honorary first {{seat in the}} sector {{reserved}} for delegations from churches not in full communion with the See of Rome; {{this was the first}} time an Ecumenical Patriarch attended a papal funeral since the East–West Schism. The Archbishop of Canterbury (then Rowan Williams), was also present at the papal funeral, the first time since the Church of England broke with the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Also for the first time ever, the head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Patriarch Abune Paulos attended a papal funeral.|$|E

2500|$|The poem {{has been}} {{translated}} into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: [...] "Gråt ej vid min grav..." [...] Translated, it reads: [...] "Do not weep at my grave - <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not there / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun's reflection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind's play above the grain fields / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn's gentle rain / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way's string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again." [...] (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: [...] "I <b>am</b> not dead. <b>I</b> only left".) ...|$|R
25|$|The February Revolution {{replaced}} the Tsar with the Russian Provisional Government, 1917 which was itself overthrown by the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The Russian army, exhausted by its participation in World War <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{final stages of}} disintegration and collapse. Even though Bolshevik influence in the ranks was strong, the officer corps was staffed with many who violently opposed communism. The Bolsheviks perceived the Tsarist army {{to be one of}} the foundations of the hated old regime, and decided to abolish it in favor of establishing a new military loyal to the Marxist cause. Thus the core of the Tsarist army became the core of the Russian Provisional Government army which became the core of the White Army, which in intermittent collaboration with interventionist forces from outside Russia (Japanese, British, French, American) battled the Red Army during the Russian Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Although {{brought up}} to follow his father's career path, Jagger [...] "was always a singer" [...] as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. [...] "I always sang as a child.

Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church choir and I also loved {{listening}} to singers on the radio–the BBC or Radio Luxembourg–or watching them on TV and in the movies." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Ford {{declined}} offers {{to run for}} either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called [...] "the ultimate achievement.

500|$|Musically, the remix {{does not}} greatly differ {{from that of}} the {{original}} apart from added rap verses by Minaj interspersed throughout the track. She adds some [...] "spunky rhymes" [...] including [...] "Mariah, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> million dollar meetin’s, [...] he was cheatin' / All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon," [...] and references Trey Songz 2009 single [...] "" [...] in a British accent.

500|$|Gravel {{took the}} 1980 defeat hard, recalling years later: [...] "I had lost my career.

I felt like I was worthless. I didn't know what I could do." [...] By his own later description, Gravel had been a womanizer while in the Senate, and in December 1980 {{he and his wife}} Rita separated. They filed for divorce in September 1981; she would later get all of his Senate pension income.|$|E
500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackman {{suggested}} that Aronofsky cast Rachel Weisz as his character's wife. The director, {{who was in}} a relationship with the actress, had originally hesitated to show the studio signs of favoritism in casting Weisz. With Jackman's earnest recommendation, the actress was cast as Izzi/Isabel. For her role, Weisz read books and first-person accounts about people who had terminal illnesses. The actress also visited hospitals to see young people who were dying and under hospice care. [...] "There were a few days where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> headspace where I could say: 'I could go now'," [...] said Weisz.|$|E

[...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E

But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Brisbane {{after the first}} round of trials, Tonelli tore rib cartilage while participating in judo at high school. The pain of the injury restricted him to swimming backstroke for four months, and his times steadily improved during this period under the guidance of John Rigby at the Valley Pool. At the final selection event, he came second in both the 100m and 200m backstroke behind Olympic gold medallist Brad Cooper to earn his international debut. At the World Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he came sixth in the 200m backstroke behind East Germany's Roland Matthes, who set a world record. Tonelli self-deprecatingly noted that [...] "I didn't get to see him [...] swim in the final, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same race five sets of speedos behind".|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Judge Green {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps, the {{predecessor}} to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially [...] "optimistic that the military {{was going to be}} a good life," [...] until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city." [...] It was then that Green [...] "realized for real that I was really in a segregated army, and there was always, as long as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey doesn't {{deny that}} he shoots from the hip, {{in a style}} that can unhinge the fragile egos of show business. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tire business," [...] {{reasoned}} Aubrey, [...] "I wouldn't be hurt if the customer didn't buy my tires. I'd think, 'So what?' But in my business, if I don't buy the script, then the writer kicks the dog and beats his wife. So you learn {{to pay attention to}} personal relationships. But that doesn't mean you lie to people. I've been the screwer and the screwee, and I know which is better. It's better to be the screwer, and it's very difficult to do that with honesty, but it's how I prefer to be treated. I don't want power now, or authority, so I suppose my candor can't hurt me.|$|E
