40|$|Sheet metals {{often have}} {{flatness}} defects {{which are usually}} combined with internal stresses. Flatness defects as well as internal stresses are undesirable because they make the further treatment more difficult and deteriorate {{the quality of the}} sheet metal. Roller levelling is a wide-spread method to minimize flatness defects and internal stresses by repreated forming under bending conditions. This thesis presents a numerical model to simulate the forming operation at roller levelling. A bilinear material law is used which allows to investigate kinematic and isotropic material hardening. The deformed shaps of the elastic-plastic structure of the sheet in the levelling machine is evaluated by the use of an iterative process. Contact conditions between the rollers and the sheet are satisfied by a superposed iterative algorithm. The different positions of the rollers and the flatness defect of the sheet metal are taken as boundary conditions. Besides the internal stresses of the sheet metal are considered. Furthermore an optimization problem is formulated to get better levelling results. This optimization problem is solved by combining the process model with an optimization algorithm. Configurations which lead to optimized results within the meaning of minimum internal stresses and residual bend are calculated. Especially the <b>feed</b> <b>motions</b> of the rollers for those configurations can be determined. These results enable an extensive automization of the levelling process using predetermined <b>feed</b> <b>motions.</b> (orig.)

One kind of the cutting method which usually used is lathe process, where the process is {{maintained}} toward work substance of cylindrical shape. This observation is aimed to determine the effect or response graphic of independent variable which determined (spindle rotation speed, <b>feed</b> <b>motion,</b> cutting depth and material hardness level) toward dependent variable (cutting force and surface coarseness) of dynamometer designed and built by Machine Technique of UNDIP. The Dynamometer is a set of measurement tool which used to estimate of cutting force by principle to change its tension to be cutting force. The Dynamometer which working is using principle of electric. Commonly, the resistance change which used to measure the tension of motion measurement (LVDT pick-ups, moving plate capacitance pick-ups). To gain the response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable in this observation is using two testing method, both testing with simple method and testing with Taguchi method. The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). Whereas the best value on surface coarseness is yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth with level 1 (0. 5 mm), <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> with level 1 (0. 045 mm / rev) and specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6).
