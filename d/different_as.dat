5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not {{all in the same}} order: the date of the crucifixion is <b>different,</b> <b>as</b> is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native Americans, who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners {{formally}} established the town of Manzanar in 1910, but abandoned the town by 1929 after the City of Los Angeles purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area.

5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly <b>different</b> <b>as</b> they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are {{classified}} within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, {{argued that a}} synonymy is very probable {{in the light of}} new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudia – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally <b>different,</b> <b>as</b> larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were <b>different.</b> <b>As</b> a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} preseason poll, however, {{speculation}} began {{as to whether}} regular-season parity would render the prediction irrelevant. Before the 2010 season, the poll had predicted the ACC winner correctly only once {{in the championship game}} era. In the Coastal Division, this speculation was groundless, as Virginia Tech's undefeated season rendered any other winner impossible. In the Atlantic Division, the situation was much <b>different.</b> <b>As</b> late as the second week of November, four of the six division teams were in contention for the division title. These candidates were whittled to three with two weeks remaining in the regular season, then to two in the final week. During that week, NC State traveled to Maryland. If NC State had won, {{it would have been the}} Atlantic Division winner by virtue of a tie-breaking win against Florida State. Instead, NC State lost 38–31, and Florida State earned a bid to the championship game.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Baroni Urbani {{described}} a new Baltic fossil species, {{of which he}} named it Prionomyrmex janzeni. After examining specimens of the new species and Nothomyrmecia macrops, Baroni Urbani stated that the newly described species and Nothomyrmecia macrops {{belong to the same}} genus (Prionomyrmex), in which he synonymised Nothomyrmecia as a genus and treated the tribe Prionomyrmecini as a subfamily, known as Prionomyrmecinae. Prior to this, John S. Clark, the original author who described Nothomyrmecia, noted that the genus was similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex; both the heads and mandibles were identical, but the nodes were <b>different.</b> <b>As</b> the mandibles of Prionomyrmex are similar to that of Nothomyrmecia, this suggests that they are intermediate to each other. This classification was short-lived, as Nothomyrmecia was separated and treated as a valid genus from Prionomyrmex by Dlussky & Perfilieva in 2003, on the base of the fusion of an abdominal segment. Other studies published in the same year came to the same conclusions of Dlussky & Perfilieva, and the subfamily Prionomyrmecinae would later be treated as a tribe in Myrmeciinae. However, Baroni Urbani would treat the tribe as a subfamily again in both his 2005 and 2008 publications, suggesting additional evidence in favor of his former interpretation as opposed to that of Ward and Brady's arguments. In 2012, P. wappleri was described by Gennady M. Dlussky, based on a fossilised worker from the Late Oligocene, Aquitanian stage. This subsequent report that described new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald et al. and Ward & Brady without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as <b>different</b> <b>as</b> the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are <b>different,</b> <b>as</b> exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically <b>different</b> <b>as</b> the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.|$|E
