Atom Smasher defeats Damage in combat and brings him to Al Pratt's home. Damage was prompted to renounce Gog, and learn by the example of Al Pratt, who, despite suffering borderline dwarfism- a height handicap that was a matter of ridicule in the early days of his membership in the original Justice Society until he received his powers- led a simple lifestyle and had a fulfilling existence. Instead, he renounces Al Pratt, blowing up his home and the records of his adventures and claiming to have always been abandoned by him, while Gog will be always at his side. Called by Magog, he rejoins Gog, but there he's asked to kneel and show him his devotion (and expecting the rest of his followers to do the same). When some question this request, Gog becomes angry, even going as far as to threaten them.|$|E

This paper discusses the game and various strategies not only to play the game, but to teach some mathematics using the game as an example. Invicta Plastics was the original producer of the game in 1971 and it holds the worldwide Trademark for the name. Here we study the game with 4 slots and 6 colors, although other versions are obviously possible. 1 The Game Mastermind is a game played between two people. One selects a secret code and the other makes successive guesses to determine the secret code by making guesses for each of which the first person gives an indication of how close the guess is. The code is a sequence of four colors chosen from a set of six as is each guess. In the physical game, there are colored pegs that fit into four adjacent holes. The colors may repeat in the sequence, so altogether, there are 64 = 1296 different possible codes (and guesses). The colors vary in different versions of the game, so we will arbitrarily use these six: red, green, blue, yellow, cyan and purple. In this paper, if we <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a general sort of position, we may just use the numbers from 1 to 6 to represent the colors. Thu...|$|E

After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it.

40|$|Every year, the {{international}} academic and research community dedicates {{a week in}} October to discuss, debate, and learn more about Open Access. Open Access in the academic sense refers to the free, immediate, and online access {{to the results of}} scholarly research, primarily academic, peer-reviewed journal articles. In the United States, the movement in support of Open Access has, in the last decade, been growing dramatically. Because of this growing interest in Open Access, a group of academic librarians from the Georgia Tech library, Wendy Hagenmaier (Digital Collections Archivist), Fred Rascoe (Scholarly Communication Librarian), and Lizzy Rolando (Research Data Librarian), got together to talk to folks in the thick of it, to try and unravel some of the different concerns and benefits of Open Access. But we didn’t <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Open Access for journal articles – we wanted to examine more broadly {{what it means to be}} “open”, what is open information, and what relationship open information has to the public good. In this podcast, we talk with different people who have seen and experienced open information and open access in practice. In the first act, Dan Cohen from the DPLA speaks about efforts to expand public access to archival and library collections. In the second, we’ll hear an argument from Christine George about why things sometimes need to be closed, if we want them to be open in the future. Third, Kari Watkins speaks about specific example of when a government agency decided, against legitimate concerns, to make transit data open, and why it worked for them. Fourth, Peter Suber from Harvard University will give us the background on the Open Access movement, some myths that have been dispelled, and why it is important for academic researchers to take the leap to make their research openly accessible. And finally, we’ll hear from Michael Chang, a researcher who did take that leap and helped start an Open Access journal, and why he sees openness in research as his obligation...|$|E

"A few years ago, I started thinking about an entirely new way to tell a story, far different from traditional TV. I didn't <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about 'saving the world' in fiction, I {{wanted to create a}} narrative that spilled out into the streets. One that you could live inside of for a while. How cool would it be, I thought, to create a story that exists all around you all of the time? On your laptop, your mobile phone, on your sidewalks, as a secret message hidden in your favorite song or while standing at the bus stop on your way to work. And, taking it further, what if your participation over a few weeks or months actually impacts the story's development and creates positive change in the real world because a philanthropic mission is integrated into the narrative itself? The Conspiracy For Good is the culmination of this dream. This is the pilot project for a first-of-itskind interactive story that empowers its audience to take real-life action and create positive change in the world. Call it Social Benefit Storytelling. To achieve this, I need you to participate. Reality and fiction have to blur. Every story needs a villain and you will meet the villain in the STORY SO FAR section on this site. And every story needs a hero. That's where YOU come in. As part of The Conspiracy For Good you will join a collective of thinkers, artists, musicians, and causes, creating a unified voice to fight the forces of social and environmental injustice.
