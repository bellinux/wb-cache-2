40|$|Preliminary draft- {{please do}} not cite without {{permission}} Labour disputes might serve as indicators of socio-economic devel-opment, because strike measures such as frequency or <b>days</b> <b>not</b> <b>worked</b> reflect <b>not</b> only the overall economic and political conditions, but in-form also about ongoing conflicts {{in the relationship between}} capital and labour. The availability of comparable and well-documented data on strikes suggests the use of a quantitative approach to these issues. There is a body of literature analysing the strike history of German speaking countries. However, these studies are largely of qualitative nature or restricted to particular economies. The contribution of this paper is the analysis of labour conflicts from a cross-country perspec-tive, concentrating on the strike history of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland from 1901 - 2004. The method utilised in this paper is spectral analysis. This approach allows to examine the cyclical struc-ture of the strike series as well as its interrelationship with the business cycle in the countries under consideration. The main findings are that most of the fluctuation in strike activity is dominated by short cy-cles of 3 - 5 years, particularly {{in the second half of}} the last century. In addition, there is evidence that the 3 - 5 years business cycles had an impact on strike activity at least in Germany and Austria for the extraordinary growth period until the 1970 s...|$|R

After heavy fighting he identified the Irish defence works {{and returned to the}} English camp with 12 dead and 30 wounded. For six days heavy rain held up the fighting, until the weather cleared on 2 October. The weather was important because the matchlock muskets of the <b>day</b> would <b>not</b> <b>work</b> in wet conditions. On 2 October, Sir Samuel Bagnall led his regiment of infantry into the Pass at the head of four other regiments. The English breached the first barricade, and Thomas Bourke's regiment led the way to the second and third lines of defence. The English took the second line only to find themselves in a trap, with gunfire concentrated from three sides. They tried to dislodge the Irish from their remaining positions for three more hours before retreating, with the Irish in close pursuit. The English admitted 46 killed and 120 wounded, but it is thought that they understated their losses throughout the campaign.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Physicians' {{mental health}} may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the number of}} days of work and time spent on-call, and improved by sleep and days-off. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the associations of depressive symptoms with taking days of off duty, hours of sleep, and the number of days of on-call and overnight work among physicians working in Japanese hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study as a national survey was conducted by mail. The study population was 10, 000 randomly selected physicians working in hospitals who were also members of the Japan Medical Association (response rate 40. 5 %). Self-reported anonymous questionnaire was sent to assess the number of days off-duty, overnight work, and on-calls, and the average number of sleep hours on <b>days</b> <b>not</b> working overnight in the previous one month. Depressive state was determined by the Japanese version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the associations between depressive symptoms and the studied variables. Results Among the respondents, 8. 3 % of men and 10. 5 % of women were determined to be depressed. For both men and women, depressive state was associated with having no off-duty days and averaging less than 5 hours of sleep on <b>days</b> <b>not</b> doing overnight <b>work.</b> Depressive state was positively associated with being on-call more than 5 days per month for men, and more than 8 days per month for women, and was negatively associated with being off-duty more than 8 days per month for men. Conclusion Some physicians need some support to maintain their mental health. Physicians who do not take enough days-off, who reduced sleep hours, and who have certain number of days on-calls may develop depressive symptoms. </p...|$|R

The GG-component {{also needs to be}} averaged over 1 day to cancel the influence of the ecliptic components which have components parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth and contribute to the NS difference measured by the GG-component. Additionally, the directional channels of the Nagoya MD have an angular distribution biased toward the northern hemisphere, while the GMDN has a global angular distribution. It is important, therefore, to examine whether the long-term variation of the 3 D anisotropy derived from the conventional analysis of the observed {{diurnal variation}} and the GG-component is consistent with the anisotropy observed by the GMDN which is capable of accurately measuring anisotropy with better time resolution. In this paper, we analyze the 3 D anisotropy observed with the GMDN over 22 years between 1992 and 2013 and compare it with the anisotropy observed with the Nagoya multidirectional MD, especially focusing on the NS anisotropy for which the GG-component has been the only reliable measurement at the 50 to 100 GV region. Based on the difference of the response rigidities between the GMDN (approximately 60 GV) and the GG-component (approximately 80 GV), we also discuss the rigidity dependence of the NS anisotropy.|$|R
