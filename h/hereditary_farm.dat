From 1935, Wehrmacht staged mock battles at the festival with the participation of up to 10,000 soldiers, airplanes and panzers. In 1933, during his inaugural speech at the festival, Hitler announced the passage of a new law, the Reichserbhofgesetz, the State <b>Hereditary</b> <b>Farm</b> Law, which provided safeguards for the integrity of ownership of some family farms.|$|E

The mansion was built in 1902 by Charles K. Cummings, who decribed the original structure as having, a rather unusual arrangement, the master’s house, the quarters for a farmer or caretaker, and the stable, all being joined together under one roof. This was done {{with a view to}} economy of construction and management; and especially during the winter months this grouping together of quarters, which more often appear as separate buildings, has been found convenient and agreeable In 1915, Palmer renovated the mansion, moving the stables and coach house to separate buildings and replacing them with a dining room and ballroom respectively. He also added an addition for a screened patio, guest rooms, and servants quarters. This ultimately gave Willowdale the form it has today.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the earlier}} days, {{agriculture}} {{was the primary}} activity with hygienic and sweet water available from the multitude of tanks also called [...] " [...] Kuttai" [...] and [...] " [...] "Kulam". There were green pastures and one could see herds of goats, sheep and buffaloes grazing. This aided development of agro based industries like butter making and Uthukuli was known for its famed Butter. There were also many Rice and Paddy Hulling mills facilitating agro based trade. However {{the rapid expansion of}} textile industries in Tiruppur led to installation of many dyeing units and soon, polluted effluents from the Textile city of Tiruppur converted the once fertile Noyyal river into a virtual drain. The polluted river and vanishing tanks had dealt a big, still unrecoverable blow to agriculture, dairy farming and Rice mills / Paddy Hulling in these areas. Consequently, the young and old of this land are now forced to seek employment opportunities outside this once scenic spot. Apart from water pollution, scarcity of water and steep rise in labor costs in an unorganized labor sector has resulted in agriculture taking a back seat and the traditional <b>hereditary</b> <b>farms</b> called [...] "Thottams" [...] are fast vanishing.|$|R
50|$|Until 1960, Einöllen {{was well}} {{supplied}} with shops serving daily needs. Found {{in the village}} in those days were four grocer’s shops, two hairdresser’s shops, two locksmiths, two blacksmiths, two painting businesses, two butcher’s shops, two bakers, two tailors, two shoemakers, one wainwright and two inns. The two inns are still in business, and alongside them are a building company, a woodworking company that makes furniture, a window construction company, a bakery and a plant nursery. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there were limestone and coal mines in Einöllen. The Drostengrube near the Strieth woods yielded more than 500 t of black coal in 1781. According to the local lore, one gallery dating from this time reaches right under the village’s built-up area. Until after the Second World War, Einöllen was strongly characterized by agriculture. Almost every family owned grain or potato fields, orchards and vegetable gardens. In 1940, Einöllen had 71 agricultural operations, {{more than half of}} which, 44, worked an area of between 2 and 10 ha, while two bigger ones worked areas of more than 20 ha. There were seven <b>hereditary</b> <b>farms,</b> of which six were of less than 20 ha and one more. Making up the agricultural lands were 346 ha of cropland, 217 ha of grain fields, 3 ha of gardening and fruitgrowing lands, 124 ha of meadowland, 1 ha of vineyard and 86 ha of forest. The farms Heinzweiler, Harstholz, Hobstätten and Kinzenäcker have not been mentioned as homesteads since the 17th century; their names, however, persist as cadastral toponyms for farm fields. Since 1960, three agricultural operations have established themselves outside the village’s built-up area {{on the other side of}} the Sulzbach, one of which lies right near the former Hobstätten farm mentioned above. The strip fields Kinzenacker, Hebenacker, Krippes, Wetterhembusch, Dörrstück and Zwerchgräben never were of any great quality for farming. The fields with the greatest yields were Auf dem Grund, Layenacker, Dellweidchen and Rudershöll. Nowadays, only one professional farmer is to be found in Einöllen, and two of the three farmers who have moved out of the village are already seeking their livelihoods in other fields of endeavour. Many buildings formerly designed and planned for agriculture have been “modernized” into contemporary dwellings. About 1900, agriculture and crafts offered only a few people a fair livelihood. Anyone who wanted to earn a lot of money had to work in the Ruhr area or the Saarland. Nowadays, only a few people living in Einöllen actually work here. The foremost destination for women who commute is the firm Braun, a maker of elastic bandages in Wolfstein, whereas men mainly commute to jobs in Kaiserslautern and Kusel, or even as far as Ludwigshafen.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} creation and transmission of the Mescher two-handed bones playing style which was first developed by the German-American farmer, Albert Mescher, in the 1920 s, in Iowa, and subsequently passed on to his son, Jerry. Jerry has since passed on the style to his sister, Bernie, and the siblings are now the principal exponents of the style. The style {{is marked by a}} pervasive rhythmic syncopation derived from the ragtime music that Albert pumped out of the family player piano {{when he was a young}} boy learning to play the bones. The Mescher bones players are amateur musicians and their performance practice is characterised by an almost total reliance on recorded music, rather than live music. The Mescher bones players do not belong to any community of folk musicians, and they rarely play their bones in live music ensemble contexts. The parlour of the family home served as the primary site for the development and aural transmission of the style. A self-taught musician, Albert Mescher invented his bones playing style in the technologised parlour soundscape, where the player piano and the phonograph gave him access to the the post-Victorian sound of ragtime music and facilitated the cultivation of his musicality. A central theme in the dissertation is the critical role played by domestic music playback technology in the creation of the Mescher sonic environment, and more generally in the transformation of the American musicscape in the early twentieth century. While Mescher musicality was forged indoors in the parlour, Mescher spatiality was constructed outdoors on the landscape where Albert passed on his regionally-inflected, <b>hereditary</b> German-American <b>farming</b> practices to his son. Analysis of Mescher spatiality reveals a set of aesthetic imperatives, including an appreciation for order, repetition, and symmetry of design which were inscribed through a dynamic and dialectical engagement between the Mescher farmers and the gridded midwestern landscape. Analysis of the bones arrangements composed by Albert reveals the presence of these same aesthetics of measure in Mescher musicality. On the land, the relationship between father and son was dissonant. In the parlour it was more harmonious. There, entrained to the sonorities and rhythms of American popular music, and a shared musical aesthetic, father and son realised a realignment of their relationship. Albert created a set of rhythm bones arrangements, which he passed on beat-for-beat to Jerry. Each of Albert’s bones arrangments is composed to accompany a particular recording of music and they are performed with these same recordings today by Jerry and Bernie. Father and son also developed a duetting practice that is characterised by the synchronisation of the sonic materials of the bones arrangements and the choreographic alignment of the players bodies. The arrangements and the choreography have prescriptive force in Mescher practice and they constitute the primary musical artifacts of the style. Today, Jerry and Bernie perform the Mescher duets in a ritual act of embodied remembering. The theoretical armature for the research is interdisciplinary, and is constructed at an intersection of ethnomusicology and cultural geography. The development of Mescher spatiality and musicality is framed by the formation of the Amercian midwestern landscape and the micro-geography of the American, technologised domestic soundscape. This panoramic sweep in the research is complemented by an ethnography of Mescher musical and farming practices, and a search therein for a perspective on “the territory of the heart and the mind”...|$|R
40|$|Foi realizado um estudo dos defeitos congênitas diagnosticados em bovinos, ovinos e bubalinos mediante revisão dos protocolos de necropsia do Laboratório Regional de Diagnóstico da Faculdade de Veterinária da Universidade Federal de Pelotas entre 1978 e 2009. A ocorrência de defeitos congênitos em bovinos, ovinos e bubalinos representou 0, 88 %, 0, 36 % e 7, 54 % respectivamente, de todos os materiais dessas espécies recebidos. Em bovinos os defeitos esporádicos representaram 45, 83 % dos diagnósticos, os hereditários 6, 25 %, os provavelmente hereditários 29, 16 % e os ambientais ou provavelmente ambientais 16, 66 %. Dos 48 casos de defeitos congênitos diagnosticados em bovinos 21 (43, 75 %) afetaram o sistema esquelético (condrodisplasia, escoliose, desvio lateral da mandíbula, fenda palatina e malformação não classificada), nove (18, 75 %) o sistema nervoso central (hipoplasia dos lobos frontais e olfatórios, degeneração cerebelar cortical, espinha bífida, hipomielinogênese congênita, hipermetria hereditária, hipoplasia cerebelar e paquigiria), nove (18, 75 %) o sistema muscular (artrogripose), três (6, 25 %) o sistema {{cardiovascular}} (persistência do ducto arterioso e malformação não classificada), um (2, 08 %) o sistema linfático (hipoplasia linfática), um (2, 08 %) o sistema gastrintestinal (atresia anal), e, um (2, 08 %) o olho (catarata congênita). Em cinco casos (10, 41 %) vários sistemas estavam afetados (diprosopo). Em bovinos foram diagnosticadas diversas doenças hereditárias (hipermetria hereditária, artrogripose, hipoplasia linfática) ou suspeitas de serem hereditárias (condrodisplasia). Ocorreram, também, com menor freqüência, defeitos congênitos de origem ambiental (hipomielinogenese, por carência de cobre) ou possivelmente ambiental (fenda palatina, hipoplasia cerebelar, degeneração cerebelar cortical). Todos os casos de defeitos congênitos observados em ovinos (gêmeos anômalos e aprosopia) afetaram vários sistemas e eram esporádicos. Em bubalinos todas as malformações diagnosticadas são hereditárias (artrogripose, miotonia e dermatose mecânico-bolhosa) ou suspeitas de serem hereditárias (albinismo, megaesôfago e hidranencefalia/hipoplasia cerebelar). Concluiu-se que os defeitos congênitos esporádicos têm pouca importância nas três espécies e que defeitos congênitos de causas ambientais, apesar de pouco freqüentes, podem trazer prejuízos econômicos importantes em determinadas regiões ou estabelecimentos. As doenças hereditárias são importantes não só pela mortalidade mas, também, pela possibilidade de disseminação de genes indesejáveis nas diferentes raças. Em bubalinos a alta frequência de doenças hereditárias na raça Murrah foi atribuída a alta consanguinidade do rebanho brasileiro. Medidas de controle devem ser tomadas para evitar-se a contínua disseminação, principalmente dos genes recessivos, em bubalinos e bovinos. Congenital {{defects in}} cattle, sheep and buffalo were studied through {{a review of}} necropsy files of the Regional Diagnostic Laboratory of the Veterinary Faculty at the Federal University of Pelotas between 1978 and 2009. The occurrence of congenital defects in cattle, sheep and buffalo were 0. 88 %, 0. 36 %, and 7. 54 %, respectively, from all specimens received. Cattle congenital defects of undetermined etiology represented 45. 83 % of the congenital defects, known hereditary and probably hereditary diseases represented 6. 25 %, and 29. 16 %, respectively, and defects associated to environmental factors represented 16. 66 %. In cattle, of the 48 congenital defects observed 21 (43. 75 %) affected the skeletal system (chondrodysplasia, scoliosis, lateral deviation of the mandible, palatoschisis and unclassified defect), nine (18. 75 %) affected {{the central nervous system}} (hypoplasia of olfatory and frontal lobes, cerebellar cortical degeneration, spina bifida, congenital hypomielinogenesis, hereditary hypermetria, cerebellar hypoplasia, and pachygiria), nine (18. 75 %) the muscular system (arthrogryposis), three (6. 25 %) the cardiovascular system (patent ductus arteriosus and unclassified malformation), one (2. 08 %) the lymphatic system (hereditary lymphatic hypoplasia), one (2. 08 %) the alimentary system (atresia ani), and one (2. 08 %) the eye (congenital blindness). In five cases (10. 41 %) different systems were affected (diprosopus). Different hereditary diseases (hereditary hypermetry, arthrogryposis, and lymphatic hypoplasia) or diseases suspected of being hereditary (chondrodysplasia) were diagnosed in cattle. Also occurred, with less frequency, congenital defects associated with environmental factors (hypomyelinogenesis due to cooper deficiency) or probably environmental factors (cleft palate, cerebellar hypoplasia, and cerebellar cortical degeneration). In sheep all observed defects were sporadic and affected various systems (anomalous twins and aprosopia). In buffalo all congenital defects were hereditary (arthrogryposis, myotonia and mechano-bullous genodermatoses) or suspected of being hereditary (albinism, megaesophagus and hydranencephaly/cerebellar hypoplasia). It is concluded that sporadic congenital defects are not important in the three species studied. Despite the low frequency congenital defects associated with environmental factors could be important in some regions or <b>farms.</b> <b>Hereditary</b> or probably hereditary diseases are important, not only by the mortality rates, but also because the risk of dissemination of the genes in the different breeds. In water buffalo the high prevalence of hereditary diseases was a consequence of the high consanguinity of the Brazilian buffalo population. Control measures need to be taken to avoid the spread of recessive genes in cattle and buffalo...|$|R
