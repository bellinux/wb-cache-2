500|$|Out of a {{need for}} a {{lighthouse}} to mark the Old Saybrook harbor, the government paid $225 for William Lynde's land at its entrance to erect a light. Abisha Woodward was contracted to build a [...] wooden tower for $2,200 and it was completed in 1803. Due to erosion threatening the foundation of the lighthouse, a seawall was constructed in 1829, and it was reinforced and widened in 1831. Also constructed was a six-room frame structure to serve as the keeper's quarters. [...] The keeper's building was replaced in 1933. The light was criticized by many sailors for being too short to be seen at an <b>effective</b> <b>distance,</b> a problem exacerbated by a local fog from the marshland that obscured the light. A petition was made to have the tower raised , but it was deemed a replacement would be better.|$|E
60|$|A fresh {{phase in}} the history of {{invention}} opened when in the eighties a new type of engine came into use, an engine in which the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam. The light, highly efficient engines that were thus made possible were applied to the automobile, and developed at last to reach such a pitch of lightness and efficiency as to render flight--{363} long known to be possible--a practical achievement. A successful flying machine--but not a machine large enough to take up a human body--was made by Professor Langley of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897. By 1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion. There had seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the perfection of railways and automobile road traction, but with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the <b>effective</b> <b>distance</b> between one point of the earth's surface and another. In the eighteenth century the distance from London to Edinburgh was an eight days' journey; in 1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that the journey from London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in a few years' time be accomplished in that same period of eight days.|$|E

40|$|Currently, for {{manufacturing}} UHF RFID passive tags, the online inspection mechanism is very simple.

For UHF RFID applications, tag usability is a very rough indicator and cannot characterize {{the performance of a}} tag accurately.
