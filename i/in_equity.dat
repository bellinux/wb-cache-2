5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the bill could not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff leave to appeal to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge <b>in</b> <b>Equity</b> McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that the mention did not exclude the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
