We give the equivalent mini-superspace description and use the reparametrization invariance of the resulting Lagrangian {{to work in the}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>constant</b> <b>potential</b> description. At that point, we restrict our analysis to those models for which the ensuing scaled mini-superspace is maximally symmetric. Those models exhibit the maximum number of autonomous integrals of motion linear in the momenta, which are constructed by the Killing vectors of the respective mini-supermetric. The integrals of motion are used to analytically solve the equations of the corresponding models. Finally, {{a brief description of the}} properties of the resulting Hubble parameters is given.

40|$|Analytical, closed-form {{solutions}} are derived for the computation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>constant</b> rates of limit-state exceedance for structures under seismic loads whose capacity is degrading with time. Seismic guidelines currently designate constant, time-independent probabilities or mean annual frequencies of exceedance that {{are assumed to}} remain invariable for the entire design life. These {{are at odds with}} the time-dependent, ever-increasing exceedance rates of ageing structures. Based on the concept of social equity and discounting of societal investments, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>constant</b> rate provides a basis for judging the safety of structures with time-dependent capacity by allowing comparisons with the code-mandated rates of limit-state exceedance. Starting from the simple SAC/FEMA solution and assuming a power-law degradation of capacity with time and a linear change in the combined epistemic and aleatory variability of capacity, we provide general solutions for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>constant</b> rate and for the limiting case of the average rate over the design life of the structure. The {{solutions are}} formulated both in the demand-based and in the intensity-based format, the latter being suitable for all limit-states, even close to global collapse.
