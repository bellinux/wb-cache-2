40|$|Research on the {{utilization}} of thorium-based fuels in the intermediate neutron spectrum of a tight pitch LWR lattice is reported in this paper. The analysis was performed using the Studsvik/Scandpower lattice physics code HELIOS. The results show that thorium-based fuels in the intermediate spectrum of tight pitch LWR have considerable advantages in terms of conversion ratio, reactivity control, non-proliferation characteristics and a reduced production of long-lived radiotoxic wastes. Due to the high conversion ratio of thorium-based fuels in intermediate spectrum reactors, the total fissile inventory required to achieve a given fuel burnup is only 11 % to 17 % {{higher than that of}} U fertile fuels. However, unlike U fertile fuels, the void reactivity coefficient with thorium-based fuels is negative in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>reactor.</b> This provides motivation for replacing U in advanced high conversion intermediate spectrum LWRs (AHCLWR), such as the Reduced-moderator reactor (RMWR) or the Supercritical reactor (SCR) ...|$|E

40|$|During the {{investigation}} of various surplus fissile material disposition proposals, uncertainties in the data of SiO{sub 2 }/Pu mixtures were discovered. These uncertainties were detected for Si/Pu ratios ranging from approximately 20 : 1 to 200 : 1. Additionally, {{it has been reported}} that metal/U{sup 235 } mixtures also have data uncertainties.

40|$|The {{superior}} uranium utilization {{efficiency of}} fast <b>spectrum</b> <b>reactors</b> relative to thermal <b>spectrum</b> <b>reactors</b> was recognized shortly after commercial reactor development started. The sodium fast reactor design, {{a type of}} liquid metal fast breeder reactor, was progressed the furthest during the 1960 s and 1970 s. However in the late 1970 s, 1980 s, and early 1990 s, the expansion of known uranium reserves, decline in nuclear power demand in the USA, and cancellation of the Integral Fast Reactor program slowed the technology development until recently. With modern computational tools for fluid dynamics, the understanding of exterior and interior subchannel coolant ow behavior can be improved. This improvement will allow existing conservatisms in thermal-hydraulic fuel assembly analysis to be minimized. This {{will lead to more}} profitable and safer fuel designs. In the past, thermal-hydraulic experiments were performed on sodium fast reactor fuel assemblies. Unfortunately, the data collected is not suitable for computational fluid dynamics simulation validation due to measurements performed with intrusive probes or poor spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, a need exists for validation reference data for Reynolds-averaged Navier- Stokes and large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling. Completion of this thesis partially met that demand by designing, procuring, constructing, and collecting PIV shakedown data on an experimental ow loop containing a 61 rod hexagonal fuel assembly with helically wrapped wire spacers. The facility was designed for laser-based optical measurement techniques using the matched index of refraction technique.

40|$|Abstract“Nuclear {{energy is}} part of a {{sustainable}} energy future” is a conclusion which is increasingly reached by a variety of energy scenario studies by world-renown institutions such as the IAEA, OECD/IEA & OECD/NEA, World Energy Council, and also reached by different national energy assessment reports. Nuclear does own various unique features that make this energy technology a prime candidate to fulfil a large part of our energy needs, beyond today;s use of nuclear energy for our electricity needs. The previous ‘wave’ of nuclear energy deployment since the 1970 s was, and still is, governed by the use of 235 U as main driver to spur this deployment of nuclear energy with gradually the introduction of the U/Pu - cycle in the thermal neutron <b>spectrum</b> <b>reactor</b> park (essentially LWR-technology). Technological progress and good economics of the U/Pu-cycle and especially the economic competitiveness of the LWR's have made this U/Pu -cycle essentially the standard worldwide. Fast <b>spectrum</b> <b>reactors</b> (FRs) haven’t yet been developed at sufficient large and industrial scale to make full benefit of the U/Pu-cycle and there are no prospects that the world would massively turn to such FRs in the immediate future. On the verge of a second wave of nuclear deployment, increasing interest is and has to be given to synergies between various nuclear reactor technologies and especially the global nuclear fuel cycle as enabler towards sustainable nuclear energy deployment. Those synergies aim at a reduced reliance on natural uranium resources, continued good economic competitiveness of nuclear energy in local markets, safe and non-proliferant use of nuclear energy, and a reduction of ultimate wastes to be disposed of. This paper provides an overview of various avenues towards sustainable nuclear energy deployment and perspectives from the nuclear industry leader AREVA...|$|R
