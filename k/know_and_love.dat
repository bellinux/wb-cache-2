5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E

Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This is ridiculous. I want to hear other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E
500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that}} [...] "considering what a {{prominent}} character Flanders became, it's strange {{to realize that}} [...] "Dead Putting Society" [...] was the first show to feature him heavily. He'd made some token appearances in the past—most notably in season one's 'Call of the Simpsons'—but 'Dead Putting Society' much more clearly defined the Ned we'd come to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> It also featured scads of good little bits and gags and seemed like a solid program." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that apart from [...] "the memorable lawn mowing sequence at the end, this episode is notable for our first viewing of the gaudy, gadget-filled, God-fearing splendour that is the Flanderses' home." ...|$|E
500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness."

Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo!

500|$|Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and {{executive}} producer Ray Winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games. One of the studio's motivations for developing the game was to combine the two mediums, with Winninger explaining [...] "One of the spaces we're interested in exploring at Harebrained, and Golem is the first effort, is how can we take those tabletop games that we <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> so much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way." [...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E
500|$|In July 1942, Walker {{recorded}} [...] "Mean Old World" [...] and [...] "I Got a Break, Baby" [...] {{as one of}} {{the first}} artists for the Los Angeles-based record company. [...] Music writer Bill Dahl described the songs as [...] "the first sign of the T-Bone Walker that blues guitar aficionados <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> his fluid, elegant riffs and mellow, burnished vocals setting a standard that all future blues guitarists would measure themselves by". [...] Shortly thereafter, his recording career was interrupted by the 1942–44 musicians' strike and the diversion of shellac (a key material used in the manufacture of the then-standard ten-inch 78rpm phonograph record) for the U.S. war effort during World War II. [...] By 1946, Walker signed with producer Ralph Bass and Black & White Records. [...] Although there is conflicting information regarding the recording date, [...] "Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)" [...] was released as a single in November 1947.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Kenneth E. Rathburn of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "Both {{versions}} of 'God Help the Outcasts' offer {{a level of}} mid-road quality {{that came to be}} expected after the Disney Renaissance," [...] writing of Mollenhauer's, [...] "The film version seems to limp around a bit while delivering more of that emotional punch needed as we transition to the second act," [...] while Midler's [...] "has that credits vibe we all <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> from Disney films" [...] which [...] "keeps us sticking around when we'd otherwise abandon the theater." [...] However, Rathburn concluded, [...] "said version is a little detached for the sake of thematic relevance." [...] Jack Smith of BBC Online gave the song a very unfavorable review, writing, [...] "The sentiments of 'God Help The Outcasts' ... are spoiled by syrupy production," [...] describing Midler's rendition as [...] "overwrought." [...] Plugged In observed, [...] "One heartwarming scene finds Esmeralda praying selflessly on behalf of the world's outcasts." [...] However, [...] "such moments are overshadowed by simmering passions, a shapely heroine and dark elements likely to upset." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Time for It" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics upon its release. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse {{called it a}} [...] "lush kiss-off track". Benjamin described it as embodying the [...] "same feisty attitude we <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> Tasia for" [...] and felt it showed promise for the parent album. Matthew Scott Donnelly commended the song as [...] "setting a brand new era into motion", calling it [...] "breezy-yet-declarative" [...] and [...] "a here-I-am declaration". [...] "No Time for It" [...] {{was identified as a}} sign of an R revival by reviewers from the Omaha World-Herald and Essence. A writer from the Omaha World-Hearld concluded by praising Fantasia for her [...] "powerful, soulful vocals". Maura Johnston included the song on her [...] "Best Songs of 2016 So Far" [...] list. Writing for PopCrush, Matthew Scott Donnelly compared the single favorably to the music of Kelly Rowland, calling it [...] "sunny but playfully sinister". Reviewing the album for the Knoxville News Sentinel, Chuck Campbell praised [...] "No Time for It" [...] as [...] "smoothly arranged and spiked with her vocals" [...] and suggested it as an answer for listeners [...] "tired of all life's drama".|$|E
500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{was a great}} {{showcase}} for not only each of the characters, but the setting of Pawnee as well, and that the episode [...] "illustrated each part of Pawnee that {{we have come to}} <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> so much". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix had the [...] "both the scope and the out-of-control but not frantic style" [...] of [...] "The Harvest Festival". He also enjoyed the scene with Leslie and Ben, and said he believed the show could get great [...] "comic mileage" [...] out of their continued secret relationship together. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin called the episode a [...] "tour de force that expertly wrapped up an excellent season". Garrett said the show's characters were [...] "so vivid and instantly memorable" [...] that the death of Li'l Sebastian really felt like a major event, even though he had only previously appeared in one other episode. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also enjoyed seeing Tom succeed with his concert, and claimed the Li'l Sebastian funeral scene was surprisingly powerful.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] finished thirteenth {{place in the}} ratings for the week of May 23–29, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.4. It was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Series creator Matt Groening listed it as his ninth favorite episode of The Simpsons and added [...] "I have a peculiar love of TV clownery". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode: [...] "The invention of the Simpsons' arch enemy as a lugubrious yet psychotic Englishman in dreadlocks succeeds wonderfully in this super-fast, super-funny episode that works by constantly reversing the audience's expectations." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "throughout the episode we found great material; it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> It’s hard for me to relate any deficiencies" [...] and added that [...] "almost every Bob episode offers a lot of fun, and this episode started that trend in fine style." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{historians have}} given Adams {{recognition}} {{as an important}} figure from {{the early years of}} baseball. Thorn has written that he [...] "may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball." [...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game we <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together {{in the early part of}} baseball." [...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{called this}} the best overall episode since season four's December 2009 episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001". He {{wrote that the}} episode had [...] "some incredibly funny jokes", but noted that the [...] "most hilarious moments" [...] from [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] came from the main characters themselves. Sepinwall enjoyed Jack's videos to his unborn son, noting it was [...] "...the [...] I <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> best: supremely confident and... oblivious to his own insanity." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club liked that the series had moved on from making the Liz character [...] "asexual and vaguely repellent" [...] for men. In his recap, Rabin much enjoyed the episode and said [...] "If {{the rest of the}} season is as good as the first two episodes, we could have a big-time comeback on our hands." [...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that Paul Giamatti was a delight as his 30 Rock character. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett was thrilled that the Tracy character was a contestant on Cash Cab, noting once the game began [...] "everything felt so right". Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News preferred [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] to the episodes of Community and The Office, which aired on NBC the same night. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student wrote that Giamatti played his part brilliantly, and that his involvement in the main plot was [...] "well-written, well-organized, and by far the best thing about the episode".|$|E

500|$|Time James Poniewozik {{wrote that}} with [...] "Journey to Regionals", Glee [...] "returned to its roots, {{balancing}} its weirdness, snark and bombast with intimate stories of small-town high school life. And it, too, by showing {{what it can}} be at its best, made its case for staying around another year." [...] IGN's Eric Goldman rated [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] 8.5/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. He felt that while it did not match {{the standards of the}} mid–season finale episode [...] "Sectionals", it was [...] "still a very satisfying wrap up to the first year of Glee." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that he [...] "went into the finale peeved at how incredibly messy last week's episode was", but overall he deemed the finale a success. Vanity Fair Brett Berk found [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] a fulfilling, albeit [...] "pretty mediocre" [...] episode, describing it as having [...] "a sense of narrative cohesion that went beyond the writers’ usual throwing-flatware-down-the-garburator modality". Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping for a little more excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for so many of our characters we've come to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love.</b> Here's to hoping Glee can get back its stellar momentum in season two." ...|$|E
500|$|Eve drew {{criticism}} for its formulaic writing, and the lead's poor performance. The show was included {{on a list}} by Ebony's Kevin L. Clark profiling the top ten worst black television shows of all time. Clark was critical of the episodes' titles, such as [...] "Condom Mania", [...] "She Snoops to Conquer" [...] and [...] "Porn Free", and wrote that they indicated an overuse of [...] "outrageous clichés that boob-tube audiences would come to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> once reality TV hit its boon". Arianna Davis of Refinery29 negatively compared Eve to 1990s black sitcoms, and determined {{that it was a}} part of the [...] "rollout of campy shows [...] that felt less like purposeful programming and more like cheap attempts at copying a successful advertising model". The Los Angeles Times Mimi Avins felt that the show lacked the spark and the writing quality of Sex and the City, identifying Eve as its weakest link. She felt that Eve did not show [...] "the acting ability or high-voltage charisma that vaulted Will Smith from rapper to television star" [...] in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. During her review of the original pilot, Melanie McFarland wrote that the sitcom lacked any potential due to Eve's poor performance on top of the [...] "errible scenery, cheap costumes and a few glaring miscasts". Eve's decision to distance the series from her identity as a rapper was questioned by Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant, who felt that the character of Shelly could have used [...] "the personality charge" [...] from Eve's life. Despite finding Eve a charismatic presence, Catlin felt that her acting, along with that of Ali Landry, was poorly-developed. Echoing Catlin's assessment, the San Francisco Gates Tim Goodman was critical of Eve and Landry's performance. Goodman also wrote that the show was an example of [...] "the worst writing on television", citing its homophobic jokes and its reliance on clichés.|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
