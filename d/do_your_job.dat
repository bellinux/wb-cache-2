2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> {{to the best of your}} ability." [...] And there were those parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|E

Its more than a magazine — its a crucible of ideas forged in the time of Emancipation, tempered through depression and war and the civil-rights movement, and honed as sharp and relevant as ever in an age of breathtaking technological and economic change. Through it all, The Nation has exhibited that great American tradition of expanding our moral imaginations, stoking vigorous dissent, and simply taking the time to think through our countrys challenges anew.
