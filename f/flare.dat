The question whether gamma ray line (GRL) <b>flares</b> {{are different from}} other <b>flares</b> is reevaluated, and <b>flares</b> with gradual hard X-ray time profiles are searched for and shown to share many common characteristics.

40|$|We have {{produced}} annual estimates {{of national and}} global gas <b>flaring</b> and gas <b>flaring</b> efficiency from 1994 through 2008 using low light imaging data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Gas <b>flaring</b> is a widely used practice for the disposal of associated gas in oil production and processing facilities where there is insufficient infrastructure for utilization of the gas (primarily methane). Improved utilization of the gas is key to reducing global carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The DMSP estimates of <b>flared</b> gas volume {{are based on a}} calibration developed with a pooled set of reported national gas <b>flaring</b> volumes and data from individual <b>flares.</b> <b>Flaring</b> efficiency was calculated as the volume of <b>flared</b> gas per barrel of crude oil produced. Global gas <b>flaring</b> has remained largely stable over the past fifteen years, in the range of 140 to 170 billion cubic meters (BCM). Global <b>flaring</b> efficiency was in the seven to eight cubic meters per barrel from 1994 to 2005 and declined to 5. 6 m 3 per barrel by 2008. The 2008 gas <b>flaring</b> estimate of 139 BCM represents 21 % of the natural gas consumption of the USA with a potential retail market value of $ 68 billion. The 2008 <b>flaring</b> added more than 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) into the atmosphere. The DMSP estimated gas <b>flaring</b> volumes indicate that global gas <b>flaring</b> has declined by 19 % since 2005, led by gas <b>flaring</b> reductions in Russia and Nigeria, the two countries with the highest gas <b>flaring</b> levels. The <b>flaring</b> efficiency of both Russia and Nigeria improved from 2005 to 2008, suggesting that the reductions in gas <b>flaring</b> are likely the result of either improved utilization of the gas, reinjection, or direct venting of gas into the atmosphere, although the effect of uncertainties in the satellite data cannot be ruled out. It is anticipated that the capability to estimate gas <b>flaring</b> volumes based on satellite data will spur improved utilization of gas that was simply burnt as waste in previous years...|$|R

The limited predictability, non-linearity, and self-organized criticality of the <b>flares</b> allow us to study systems of <b>flares</b> in the field of the complex systems. Both the occurrence time and the location of <b>flares</b> detected from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 are used to design the growing <b>flares</b> network. The solar surface is divided into cells with equal areas. The cells, which include <b>flare(s),</b> are considered as nodes of the network. The related links are equivalent to sympathetic <b>flaring.</b> The extracted features present that the network of <b>flares</b> follows quantitative measures of complexity. The power-law nature of the connectivity distribution with a degree exponent greater than three reveals that <b>flares</b> form a scale-free and small-world network. The great value of the clustering coefficient, small characteristic path length, and slowly change of the diameter are all characteristics of the <b>flares</b> network. We show that the degree correlation of the <b>flares</b> network has the characteristics of a disassortative network.

40|$|The World Bank has set 2030 as {{the year}} for the {{cessation}} of routine natural gas <b>flaring</b> in countries concerned. Nigeria {{is among the most}} consistent natural gas <b>flaring</b> nations on earth and natural gas <b>flaring</b> remains an intractable negative externality for approximately six decades of crude oil exploration in the country. With a focus on the long run, we employ the Autoregressive Distribution Lag bounds test to cointegration approach to search for the determinants of natural gas <b>flaring</b> in Nigeria using secondary data from 1984 - 2013. Empirical result identified natural gas <b>flaring</b> penalty, crude oil production, natural gas price, natural gas marketization and lack of natural gas infrastructure as fundamental determinants of natural gas <b>flaring</b> in Nigeria. Crude oil production contributed the highest to the increase in natural gas <b>flaring</b> while natural gas marketization has the greatest impact on gas <b>flaring</b> abatement.

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{study of}} the chromospheric ribbon evolution in Hα two-ribbon <b>flares</b> is performed. The data set consists of 50 confined (62 %) and eruptive (38 %) <b>flares</b> that occurred from June 2000 to June 2015. The <b>flares</b> are selected homogeneously over the Hα and GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) classes, {{with an emphasis on}} including powerful confined <b>flares</b> and weak eruptive <b>flares.</b> Hα filtergrams from Kanzelhöhe Observatory in combination with MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) and HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) magnetograms are used to derive the ribbon separation, the ribbon-separation velocity, the magnetic-field strength, and the reconnection electric field. We find that eruptive <b>flares</b> reveal statistically larger ribbon separation and higher ribbon-separation velocities than confined <b>flares.</b> In addition, the ribbon separation of eruptive <b>flares</b> correlates with the GOES SXR flux, whereas no clear dependence was found for confined <b>flares.</b> The maximum ribbon-separation velocity is not correlated with the GOES flux, but eruptive <b>flares</b> reveal on average a higher ribbon-separation velocity (by ≈ 10 km s^- 1). The local reconnection electric field of confined (cc= 0. 50 ± 0. 02) and eruptive (cc= 0. 77 ± 0. 03) <b>flares</b> correlates with the GOES flux, indicating that more powerful <b>flares</b> involve stronger reconnection electric fields.
