Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. <b>Immune</b> <b>systems</b> appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
30|$|We {{live in a}} world full {{of viruses}} and our <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> fights against them to keep us healthy and {{disease-free}} (Fensterl et al., 2015). The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is divided into two broad categories – the innate and the adaptive, both of which are required to protect against virus infection. The innate <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> which is kicked off very early during virus infection, is the first line of antiviral defense; whereas the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> activated later, is dependent on the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, an appropriate activation of the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is critical for the elimination of viruses, from an organism, by both branches of the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> has a {{cognitive}} {{ability to differentiate}} between healthy and unhealthy cells. This paper explores parallels between the human <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems {{within the context of}} computer science. The paper aims to answer questions like: What insights can be obtained from studying the human <b>immune</b> <b>system?</b> How can replicating some of the behaviors in the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> inspire further advancements in artificial intelligence. The paper also describes biological operations of <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> and analyzes events and consequences to discover consistency and correspondence between artificial intelligence disciplines and <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and concludes that <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is a highly qualified cognitive intelligent agent system...|$|R

5|$|Storm petrels seem to {{be largely}} free of blood parasites, even when in close {{proximity}} to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull.

5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} the {{molecular}} and cellular components that form the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology.

40|$|Every {{systems in}} human body {{correlate}} to maintain homeostasis. One of those systems which contribute to maintain homeostasis is the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> defends physiological functions against foreign substances and cancer cells through {{a complex and}} multilayered mechanism. The ability to defend against foreign substances and abnormal cells is done by two types of <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> which are Innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and adaptive/acquired <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> There are also certain factors that affect the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> for instance physiological factor, nutrition, psychological factor, environental factor, and exercise or physical activities. Regular exercises and physical activities with moderate intensity will boost the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Sedentary lifestyle and minimal physical activity will {{increase the risk of}} infectious diseases.

5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|Immune checkpoints affect <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> functioning. <b>Immune</b> checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Tumors can {{use these}} checkpoints to protect {{themselves}} from <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> attacks. Checkpoint therapy can block inhibitory checkpoints, restoring <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> function.|$|R
500|$|The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is a host {{defense system}} {{comprising}} many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> must detect {{a wide variety}} of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> versus the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. [...] In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.|$|R
30|$|The {{adaptive}} (acquired) <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{is characterized}} by high antigen specificity. Main cell types of the adaptive immunity are B and T cells that recognize non self-proteins by their highly specified antigen receptors. The uniqueness of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is the enormously high variety of these antigen receptors whereby {{a vast number of}} different antigens can be detected. Another important characteristic of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is its memory. The memory enables a much faster reaction of this part of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> during a renewed contact with an already known antigen. Besides activation of the cells of the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> via their receptors, another possible activation occurs via signals released by the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> demonstrating the high interconnectivity between both parts of the vertebrate <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E

50|$|The innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and the {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> each comprise both humoral and cell-mediated components.|$|R
25|$|The {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> {{also known}} as the acquired <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> or, more rarely, as the specific <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> is a subsystem of the overall <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system).</b> Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|R
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E
