500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions. On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. [...] Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.|$|E

6000|$|A sunbeam of placid benevolence {{played on}} Mr. Pickwick's {{features}} as he said, 'I have half {{made up my}} mind to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know of no}} agreement," [...] Sprague interrupted. [...] "Do <b>you,</b> Stine? We <b>engaged</b> <b>you</b> by the month. There's your pay. Will {{you sign}} the receipt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Not, sire, as yet. [...] For, marching forwards, I heard gunnery boom, [...] And, {{fearing that}} the Prussians had <b>engaged</b> <b>you,</b> [...] I stood at pause. Just then--- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at it}} in that light, George," [...] said my uncle; and {{he added}} in a more cheerful tone, [...] "I am only going to get <b>engaged,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
60|$|Cleo. O 'twas his plot; his ruinous design, To <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> in my love by jealousy. Hear him; {{confront him}} with me; let him speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got him!" [...] said Sellers to himself. Then aloud, [...] "This is fortunate. Could I <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> {{to restore}} {{some of my}} {{paintings}} that need that attention?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! I guess we'll <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> as packer, but I {{must speak}} to the boss first," [...] and Carnally led Andrew a short {{distance}} back into the shadow.|$|E
6000|$|Jenny and Me were <b>engaged,</b> <b>you</b> see, [...] On {{the eve of}} the Fancy Ball; So a kiss or two {{was nothing}} to you [...] Or any one else at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{anything}} turns up," [...] Mr. Jarvis asked eagerly, [...] "anything tangible, I mean, you'll tell me of it, won't you, there's a good fellow? Of course, I suppose {{your future}} is outside my control now, but I <b>engaged</b> <b>you</b> first, you know, Chetwode. There aren't many things done here that I haven't a say in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Brass,' {{said the}} other, in a decided tone, 'I am <b>engaged.</b> <b>You</b> see that I am {{occupied}} with these gentlemen. If you will communicate your business to Mr Chuckster yonder, {{you will receive}} every attention.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are to understand," [...] Francine replied sharply, [...] "that I {{must have}} Miss Ladd's {{approval}} before I can <b>engage</b> <b>you.</b> Suppose {{you come to}} Brighton? I will pay your fare, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he looked}} at me quite solemnly. [...] "I think," [...] said he, [...] "you had best get to your studies. You will find more than enough to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> there. Leave my affairs to me, boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear--I do wish I knew {{whether you}} were {{a boy or a}} girl. Do you seriously suggest that I should <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> as my housekeeper?" [...] asked Mr. Peter Hope, now upright {{with his back to the}} fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I {{could not}} help it. If you {{had told me that}} those two dear old ladies opposite, the Misses Williams, were both <b>engaged,</b> <b>you</b> would not have {{surprised}} me more. It is really too funny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might, if {{you told}} father you {{expected}} to be engaged on those terms. For it concerns HIM as much as me. And HE <b>engages</b> <b>you,</b> and not I. Otherwise I'd think it was only your talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy taunts and effrontery {{will not}} avail thee, knave," [...] he cried. [...] "Thou knowest that I would have <b>engaged</b> <b>thee</b> {{as the leader}} of a chosen band, to favor the flight of one dear from Venice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they will}} <b>engage</b> <b>you,</b> lad, {{for they are}} hard up for an {{assistant}} blacksmith just now, and I happen to be hand-and-glove with some o' the chief men of the yard, who'll be happy to take anyone recommended by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came here}} by accident; being {{on board the}} cutter at the time her late {{commander}} determined to <b>engage</b> <b>you.</b> It was not {{in his power to}} land me, as I trust you will not hesitate to do; your conjecture of my being a non-combatant--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> on the spot; to-morrow {{you go down}} to Nosham Taws {{and begin}} {{teaching}} the children. I must add that in addition you {{will be expected to}} aid the Earl with his Russian correspondence. He has large mining interests at Tschminsk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's papa's putting in, I know. I hate {{all that}} hankering after filthy lucre. You {{ought to be}} ashamed of wanting to go so far away just when you're <b>engaged</b> <b>You</b> wouldn't care about leaving me, I suppose the least.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you thought}} at first that the writer of the threats really had {{possession}} of compromising letters; but upon hearing that she was <b>engaged</b> <b>you</b> thought it likely that the letters might {{be the work of}} some aggrieved or disappointed woman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{seems very}} unfortunate for you," [...] began Mrs. Conant, {{regarding}} the strange girl with mild interest. [...] "I suppose, when Mrs. Morrison <b>engaged</b> <b>you,</b> {{she expected to}} pass the summer at the Lodge, and afterward she forgot to notify you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Old Pendy {{thrusting}} in his oar! I'd {{have put}} a stop to your absurdity at once, if I had not been sure no one would be deluded enough to <b>engage</b> <b>you,</b> and that you would be tired of looking out, and glad to go back to your proper place at the Holt before I sailed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I had the honour to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> as Mr. Effingham's agent, sir," [...] {{returned}} the other, a little sternly, for {{he felt his}} own character for veracity involved in that of {{the subject of his}} selection, [...] "I believe, indeed, that you were writing in the office, but I did not understand it was as the clerk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us cease these pleasantries, I entreat you," [...] I laughed. [...] "Saints defend me! If {{your mood}} incline to raillery you'll find your match in some lad of the stables. As for me, I have not the time, had I the will, to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> further. Let {{me remind you}} that I would be gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{no matter}} {{at what cost}} to your amour propre. You should have remembered <b>you</b> were <b>engaged.</b> <b>You</b> forgot that, too, I suppose. And then you go and forget your quarrel. It's the most hopeless {{exhibition}} of levity I ever heard of." ...|$|R
5000|$|Times of India {{praised the}} project, writing [...] "The plot has {{numerous}} twists and turns, the storytelling is highly cathartic and music is romantic. Truly a gangster spirited feature... the film <b>engages</b> <b>you</b> {{from the beginning}} till end with shock and awe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{my money}} alone. Then {{he told me}} that he was <b>engaged</b> to <b>you.</b> He had never told me before, but yet I knew it. It all came out then. Lucy, though he is <b>engaged</b> to <b>you,</b> it is me that he loves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good; then we'll <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> as cook, {{and come}} over to-night if it's clear and our fishing prospers. Don't forget {{a dozen of}} the finest lilies for this lady to-morrow morning. Pay you now, may not be up;" [...] and Mr. Fred dropped a bright silver dollar into the basket with a patronizing air, {{intended}} to impress this rather too independent young person with a proper sense of inferiority.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father," [...] said Alice, [...] "means well by his country, {{and well}} by you; yet I {{sometimes}} fear he may rather injure than serve his good cause; {{and still more}} do I dread, that in attempting to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> as an auxiliary, he may forget those ties which ought to bind you, and I am sure which will bind you, to a different line of conduct from his own." ...|$|E
6000|$|Por. Too much, my countrymen; {{your love}} you shew, [...] That you have thought me worthy to be so; [...] But, to requite that love, I must take care, [...] Not to <b>engage</b> <b>you</b> {{in a civil}} war. [...] Two {{emperors}} at Rome the senate chose, [...] And whom they chuse, no Roman should oppose. [...] In peace or war, let monarchs hope or fear; [...] All my ambition shall be bounded here. [...] [Kissing BERENICE'S hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't, yet {{that is the}} sort of place you'd have to work in, boy, if I <b>engaged</b> <b>you,</b> for that is a correct {{description}} of my warehouse. I'm a sleeping partner in the firm. D'ye know what that is, boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} {{completely}} unsuccessful," [...] she sighed. [...] "I {{have not been able}} to hear a word about my brother. I am so sorry for poor Helen, too. They were only <b>engaged,</b> <b>you</b> know, a few days before he left for the front this last time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is he, I am sure," [...] he said, [...] "who is {{interfering in}} my concerns. Never mind, Lois, {{we will not}} talk about that, dear. Give me your hand. We are <b>engaged,</b> <b>you</b> know. You should be glad to have these few minutes with me." ...|$|R
