2500|$|Many of the <b>Dead</b> <b>Heads</b> {{would go}} on tour with the band. As a group, the <b>Dead</b> <b>Heads</b> were {{considered}} very mellow. [...] "I'd rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game", Police Det. Rick Raynor said. [...] "They don't get belligerent like they do at the games".|$|R

500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] The game's writing and dialogue were considered the main {{strengths of the}} game, with GameSpy's reviewer stating that [...] "In the vast sea of PSP titles, <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred stands 'head and shoulders' above the rest." [...] IGN said [...] "The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [...] unapologetically humorous". [...] Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating [...] "...the overused profanity just makes it feel like it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy." [...] The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons to The Darkness and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that PSP games often lacked creativity and that <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred was the exception.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred was {{composed}} by Rod Abernethy and Jason Graves and recorded at Abernethy's studio, Rednote Audio. [...] Abernethy and Graves {{had worked on}} previous games by Vicious Cycle, like Curious George. [...] The composers were interested in developing a sound for <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred that was retro-futuristic, and borrowed from other death-themed pieces like Stubbs the Zombie and Beetlejuice. [...] The development team {{did not have any}} substantial ideas for the game's music beyond the theme and mood of Hope Falls, giving the composers free rein on the soundtrack's direction.|$|E
500|$|The {{focal point}} of reviewers' {{criticism}} was <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred's gameplay, specifically the combat. [...] It was generally considered tedious and repetitive. [...] Australia's PAL Gaming Network described the combat as [...] "one of the poorest elements of the game", and Game Informer called the combat mechanics [...] "awful". [...] The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting [...] "Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles for you in battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight {{it as well as}} mutants that want you dead." [...] GameZone said [...] "I just wish the camera wouldn’t be such a hindrance sometimes." [...] Reviewers were also unhappy with <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred's loading times; Eurogamer considered them [...] "excessively high", and IGN said [...] "The only downside that crops up {{when it comes to the}} visuals are the continual loading times on just about every single area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fans and enthusiasts of {{the band}} are {{commonly}} referred to as Deadheads. While the origin of the term may be unclear, <b>Dead</b> <b>Heads</b> were made canon by the notice placed inside the Skull and Roses (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire: ...|$|R
25|$|Severed heads: {{similar to}} the têtes coupées from France; they {{represent}} <b>dead</b> <b>heads,</b> and were usually located in walls of ancient hill-forts, and are still found reused near of them. Unlike all the other types, these are {{more common in the}} north.|$|R

500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred is a third-person action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} {{a variety of}} gameplay styles, including combat, platforming, and puzzles. [...] The core gameplay of <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred revolves around Fred's missing head {{and his ability to}} [...] "switch" [...] heads by defeating certain enemies, decapitating them, and collecting their heads (referred to as [...] "headhunting"). [...] As Fred explores the city of Hope Falls, he can collect an assortment of heads, each of which has unique abilities. [...] Examples include the Stone Idol head, which Fred can use as a battering ram, and the Corpse head, which can be used to suck up and spit out water, gasoline, and other materials. [...] Fred uses these heads to navigate the city of Hope Falls, and certain parts of the city are not accessible until certain heads are found. [...] The high level of radiation in Hope Falls has led to a proliferation of grossly mutated worms, which the player can collect and use to upgrade Fred's heads and temporarily increase his fighting abilities, among other benefits. Also collectible are money and special items, which can be earned by defeating enemies or completing various side-missions. [...] There are several minigames unrelated to the plot, such as pinball and fishing, scattered around the city.|$|E
500|$|D3 {{provided}} the development team with more focus groups, {{and as a}} result, the game slowly incorporated more combat and less platforming and puzzles. Fred's combat capabilities were revamped to give him more attacks, counterattacks and combinations. [...] D3 also gave Vicious Cycle more time to develop the game, {{with the hope of}} receiving better reviews and potentially turning <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred into a franchise. [...] The delay pushed back the game's release from January to August 2007. D3Publisher bought Vicious Cycle two months before the game's release, but the company's headquarters remained in North Carolina and the staff was retained.|$|E
500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred {{takes place}} in Hope Falls, New Jersey, a once-prosperous area based on American cities in the 1940s. The city has {{steadily}} fallen from grace since a business mogul named Ulysses Pitt began accumulating power. Pitt has a background of petty crime, and there are allegations that he was somehow responsible for the disappearance of Vinni Rossini, an influential Hope Falls businessman. [...] Pitt's new [...] "Nukular Plant" [...] has recently finished construction and has caused {{a high level of}} radiation in the city, leading to strange phenomena like mutated wildlife and undead monsters.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Wharf Rats" [...] {{earned their}} {{name from the}} song, and were allowed {{to set up a}} table at every concert to support <b>Dead</b> <b>Heads</b> who {{believed}} in enjoying the Grateful Dead sober or needed support in their efforts to remain straight.|$|R

500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred was {{designed}} specifically for the PSP, and Vicious Cycle intended it to be their [...] "flagship" [...] title for the system. [...] However, the game's designers have hinted that the game could potentially be ported to the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade with a few months' work. [...] As of March 2009, D3Publisher has announced a sequel, but the designers have stated that subsequent titles were discussed during the game's development. [...] John C. McGinley has expressed interest in reprising Fred. Namco Bandai Games (the parent of D3) were impressed with the game and wanted to publish the sequel because they 'wanted' to test out Vicious Cycle's Gameplay on the PSP.|$|E
500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred {{uses the}} Vicious Engine, a game engine created and {{maintained}} by game design company Vicious Cycle Software. [...] Considered [...] "middleware" [...] {{in the video}} game industry, the engine {{was designed as a}} simple set of creation tools that could be used across multiple consoles. [...] The game was originally conceived as a platform game based on the character [...] "Geo." [...] Vicious Cycle's president, Eric Peterson, and some of his staff developed a conceptual world called [...] "Prime" [...] where Geo lived. [...] Geo had the ability to switch his head between several different shapes (a cube, sphere, cylinder, and pyramid) that would help him solve puzzles, fight, and move around Prime in his quest to stop the evil King Rhombus, who was trying to destroy Prime. [...] Each of Geo's shaped heads had unique properties that gave him different abilities—the sphere head allowed him to roll around very quickly, for example.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the game's premise and setting, {{variously}} describing it as [...] "weird", [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "silly". [...] Hope Falls, especially the area of Creepy Hollow, was compared {{to the work of}} Tim Burton. [...] <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred's graphics were warmly received, with GameSpy noting [...] "The game looks simply phenomenal on the PSP screen." [...] Pocket Gamer UK said [...] "graphically the game won't blow your head off but it is undeniably stylish." [...] Pocket Gamer also felt that the game's level design, with its emphasis on changing heads to solve environmental puzzles, made up for the [...] "mediocre combat system". [...] The character design was praised; GameSpy said [...] "Fred {{is one of the most}} interesting and entertaining characters to ever hit gaming," [...] and GameZone said [...] "Fred’s freakish form is like looking at a car crash … you really don’t want to stare but you just can’t help it." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred {{was first}} {{announced}} at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) [...] video game convention in May 2006, where a trailer was shown to the public. [...] Following this, little was heard about the game until Cogan started a developer diary on Vicious Cycle's website in March 2007. [...] Three diary entries were written by Cogan and Ellis, which provided details about the game's pre-production conceptualization and voice work. [...] In May 2007, D3 announced that John C. McGinley would be voicing Fred, and the next month the company issued a press release stating that the game was finished and ready for mass production. [...] However, the game was delayed, allowing D3 Publisher to show it at E3 2007. [...] It was eventually released on August 28, 2007 in North America after nearly two years of development. [...] It was released on October 26 in Europe, November 2 in Australia, and March 19, 2008 in Japan. [...] In December 2007, D3 reduced {{the price of the}} game, and in October 2008 it was made available for download on Sony's PlayStation Network. [...] The soundtrack was released on iTunes by Lakeshore Records on September 18, 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} <b>Dead</b> <b>Head</b> Fred is Fred Neuman (voiced by John C. McGinley), a private detective. [...] Fred {{is the only}} playable character, but since each head gives him a {{different}} set of animations, he could be considered nine separate characters. [...] As he does not have a proper face, Fred's mood is portrayed by the tone of his voice and by face-like expressions formed by his eyes and frontal lobes. [...] Fred has a wisecracking, sarcastic personality and occasionally breaks the fourth wall, such as heckling the player when he dies. [...] Ulysses Pitt (Jon Polito), the game's primary antagonist, is a small-time hoodlum turned racketeer. [...] Pitt employs many henchmen throughout Hope Falls, the most prominent of which is his lieutenant Lefty, whose right leg has been amputated and replaced with a tommygun. [...] Fred makes several allies throughout the game, including Dr. Steiner, who resurrected him, his girlfriend Jeanne Rossini (Kari Wahlgren), and his former partner Benny Salazar. [...] Fred's enemies are generally employees of Pitt, like the skeletal [...] "bone thugs", or creatures created by Hope Falls' radiation, like zombies and animated scarecrows.|$|E

60|$|Of that equestrian caste {{the symbol}} was the horse. The favourite, and {{therefore}} the chosen sacrifice of Odin, their ancestor and God, the horse's flesh was eaten at the sacrificial meal; the horse's head, hung on the ash in Odin's wood, gave forth oracular responses. As Christianity came in, and the eating of horse-flesh was forbidden as impiety by the Church, while his oracles dwindled down to such as that which Falada's <b>dead</b> <b>head</b> gives to the goose-girl in the German tale, the magic power of the horse figured only in ballads and legends: but his real power remained.|$|E
60|$|This, too, was life, Bashti meditated, as he deftly rapped the {{screaming}} puppy away from him. Four-legged life it was, young and silly and hot, heart-prompted, {{that was like}} any young man making love to his woman in the twilight, or like any young man fighting to the death with any other young man over a matter of passion, hurt pride, or thwarted desire. As much as in the <b>dead</b> <b>head</b> of Van Horn or of any man, he realized that in this live puppy might reside the clue to existence, {{the solution of the}} riddle.|$|E
60|$|It seems {{surprising}} {{to us that}} reasonable men should so readily believe such tales as these; but there are, in all ages of the world, certain habits of belief, in conformity to which the whole community go together. We all believe whatever is in harmony with, or analogous to, the general type of faith prevailing in our own generation. Nobody could be persuaded now that a <b>dead</b> <b>head</b> could speak, or a wolf change his nature to protect it; but thousands will credit a fortune-teller, or believe that a mesmerized patient can have a mental perception of scenes and occurrences a thousand miles away.|$|E
