40|$|Abstract Background Artificial <b>duplicates</b> from {{pyrosequencing}} reads {{may lead}} to incorrect interpretation of the abundance of species and genes in metagenomic studies. <b>Duplicated</b> reads were filtered out in many metagenomic projects. However, since the <b>duplicated</b> reads observed in a pyrosequencing run also include natural (non-artificial) <b>duplicates,</b> simply removing all <b>duplicates</b> may also cause underestimation of abundance associated with natural <b>duplicates.</b> Results We implemented a method for identification of exact and nearly identical <b>duplicates</b> from pyrosequencing reads. This method performs an all-against-all sequence comparison and clusters the <b>duplicates</b> into groups using an algorithm modified from our previous sequence clustering method cd-hit. This method can process a typical dataset in ~ 10 minutes; it also provides a consensus sequence for each group of <b>duplicates.</b> We applied this method to the underlying raw reads of 39 genomic projects and 10 metagenomic projects that utilized pyrosequencing technique. We compared the occurrences of the <b>duplicates</b> identified by our method and the natural <b>duplicates</b> made by independent simulations. We observed that the <b>duplicates,</b> including both artificial and natural <b>duplicates,</b> make up 4 - 44 % of reads. The number of natural <b>duplicates</b> highly correlates with the samples' read density (number of reads divided by genome size). For high-complexity metagenomic samples lacking dominant species, natural <b>duplicates</b> only make up Conclusions Our method is available from [URL] as a downloadable program and a web server. It is important not only to identify the <b>duplicates</b> from metagenomic datasets but also to distinguish whether they are artificial or natural <b>duplicates.</b> We provide a tool to estimate the number of natural <b>duplicates</b> according to user-defined sample types, so users can decide whether to retain or remove <b>duplicates</b> in their projects. </p...|$|R

40|$|Relational {{database}} is {{a collection}} of relations. <b>Duplicate</b> tuple existence is common in many real time relational databases. There is no known, simple and direct technique for finding <b>duplicated</b> records in relational database. In a relational database, if the same real-world entity is represented by more than one tuple, then such tuples are called <b>duplicate</b> tuples. Finding <b>duplicate</b> tuples and then replacing them by one best tuple is called a fusion operation. Whenever <b>duplicate</b> tuples are found in the relations of any database, those tuples must be replaced with one special best approximate tuple that represents the joint information of all the <b>duplicate</b> tuples. Present study proposes new techniques to find <b>duplicate</b> tuples and then remove those <b>duplicate</b> tuples with the correct real world tuples. In the first step <b>duplicate</b> tuples in the relation are classified based on the class label and in the second step then for each set of <b>duplicate</b> tuples functional dependency method or union method is applied to replace <b>duplicate</b> tuples with the corresponding correct real world single tuple. One possibility is to replace one set of <b>duplicate</b> tuples with one correct real world tuple. Another possibility is to replace two or more sets of <b>duplicate</b> tuples in the relation by one set of correct real world tuples. Sometimes the removal of <b>duplicate</b> tuples in the relations of any relational database can create referential integrity violations.

5|$|In 1920, the Government of Canada {{announced}} that the Imperial War Graves Commission had awarded Canada eight sites—five in France and three in Belgium—on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the architectural design competition {{would be open to}} all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of Charles Herbert Reilly representing the Royal Institute of British Architects, Paul Philippe Cret representing the Société centrale des architectes français and Frank Darling representing the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected by the United States to design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster maquette of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. The complexity of Allward's design precluded the possibility of <b>duplicating</b> the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor Percy Erskine Nobbs, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward's favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorials—those of Allward and Clemesha—and six smaller identical memorials.|$|E

This study aims to describe a pragmatic strategy of combining auto- and hand-searching <b>duplicates</b> in systematic review and to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of <b>duplicates.</b> METHODS AND FINDINGS: Literatures regarding portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) were searched by the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. <b>Duplicates</b> included one index paper and one or more redundant papers. They were divided into type-I (<b>duplicates</b> among different databases) and type-II (<b>duplicate</b> publications in different journals/issues) <b>duplicates.</b> For type-I <b>duplicates,</b> reference items were further compared between index and redundant papers. Of 10936 papers regarding PVT, 2399 and 1307 were identified as auto- and hand-searched <b>duplicates,</b> respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 11. 0 % (1201 / 10936) and 6. 1 % (665 / 10936), respectively. They included 3431 type-I and 275 type-II <b>duplicates.</b> Of 11403 papers regarding BCS, 3275 and 2064 were identified as auto- and hand-searched <b>duplicates,</b> respectively. The prevalence of auto- and hand-searched redundant papers was 14. 4 % (1640 / 11403) and 9. 1 % (1039 / 11403), respectively. They included 5053 type-I and 286 type-II <b>duplicates.</b> Most of type-I <b>duplicates</b> were identified by auto-searching method (69. 5 %, 2385 / 3431 in PVT literatures; 64. 6 %, 3263 / 5053 in BCS literatures). Nearly all type-II <b>duplicates</b> were identified by hand-searching method (94. 9 %, 261 / 275 in PVT literatures; 95. 8 %, 274 / 286 in BCS literatures). Compared with those identified by auto-searching method, type-I <b>duplicates</b> identified by hand-searching method had a significantly higher prevalence of wrong items (47 / 2385 versus 498 / 1046, p< 0. 0001 in PVT literatures; 30 / 3263 versus 778 / 1790, p< 0. 0001 in BCS literatures). Most of wrong items originated from EMBASE database.
