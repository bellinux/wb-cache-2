In this context, the kinematics of the Jaufen- and Passeier faults have been studied by carrying out paleostress analysis in combination with crustal-scale analogue modelling to infer (1) their relationship during indentation of the Adriatic plate and (2) their sensitivity in terms of fault kinematics to the geometry and motion path of Adria. The field study reveals mylonites along the Jaufen fault, which formed under lower greenschist facies conditions and is associated with top-to-the-west/northwest shear with a northern block down component. In addition, a brittle reactivation of the Jaufen shear zone under NNW-SSE to NW-SE compressional and ENE-WSW tensional stress conditions was deduced from paleostress analysis. The inferred shortening direction is consistent with fission track ages portraying Neogene exhumation of the Meran-Mauls basement south of the fault. Along the Passeier fault, deformation was only brittle to semi-ductile and paleostress tensors record that the fault was subjected to E-W extension along its northern segment varying into NW-SE compression and sinistral transpression along its southern segment. In the performed analogue experiments, a rigid, triangular shaped indenter was pushed into a sand pile resulting in the formation of a Passeier-like fault sprouting from the <b>indenter's</b> tip. These kinds of north-trending tip faults formed in all experiments with shortening directions towards the NW, N, or NE. Consequently, we argue that the formation of the Passeier fault strongly corresponds to the outline of the Adriatic indenter and was only little affected by the <b>indenter's</b> motion path due to induced strain partitioning {{in front of}} the different indenter segments. The associated fault kinematics along the Passeier fault including both E-W extension and NNW to NW shortening, however, is most consistent with a northward advancing Adriatic indenter...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{failure of}} an ideal crystal is {{dictated}} either by an elastic instability or a soft-mode instability. Previous interpretations of nanoindentation experiments on suspended graphene sheets, however, indicate an anomaly: the inferred strain in the graphene sheet directly beneath the diamond indenter at the measured failure load is anomalously large compared to the fracture strains predicted by both soft-mode and acoustic analyses. Through multiscale modeling combining the results of continuum, atomistic, and quantum calculations, and analysis of experiments, we identify a strain-shielding effect initiated by mechanochemical interactions at the graphene–indenter interface as the operative mechanism responsible for this anomaly. Transmission electron micrographs and a molecular model of the diamond <b>indenter’s</b> tip suggest that the tip surface contains facets comprising crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } planes. Ab initio and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that a covalent bond (weld) formation between graphene and the crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } facets on the <b>indenter’s</b> surface can be induced by compressive contact stresses of the order achieved in nanoindentation tests. Finite element analysis (FEA) and MD simulations of nanoindentation reveal that the shear stiction provided by the induced covalent bonding restricts relative slip of the graphene sheet at its contact with the indenter, thus initiating a local strain-shielding effect. As a result, subsequent to stress-induced bonding at the graphene–indenter interface, the spatial variation of continuing incremental strain is substantially redistributed, locally shielding the region directly beneath the indenter by limiting the buildup of strain while imparting deformation to the surrounding regions. The extent of strain shielding is governed by {{the strength of the}} shear stiction, which depends upon the level of hydrogen saturation at the <b>indenter’s</b> surface. We show that at intermediate levels of hydrogen saturation the strain-shielding effect can enable the graphene to support experimentally determined fracture loads and displacements without prematurely reaching locally limiting states of stress and deformation...|$|R

For example, Atkinson and Shi [13] investigated the apparent variation of the hardness of iron by varying the load from 15  g to 20  kg. It is found that the hardness variation is markedly reduced by liquid lubrication. This result suggests that the ISE is actually dependent upon friction condition. A similar experiment was performed by Ren et al. [14]. The load varies from 0.125 to 1  kg in the indentation process of single-crystal MgO, but the ISE is seldom affected by the addition of a liquid for this material. Li et al. [15] studied the influence of a liquid on the friction between the micro-hardness indenter and the test material. It is claimed that the friction is the major reason for the increased hardness values under low loads and the ISE is related to the surface area-to-volume ratio.

40|$|Nanoindentation is an {{effective}} technique for determining mechanical properties of bulk materials and thin films. Prevailing measurement uncertainties in nanoindentations by Vickers or Berkovich diamond pyramids are commonly caused by manufacturing imperfections of the <b>indenter's</b> side angles and tip sharpness. Moreover, the tip geometry changes over the indenter operation time, due to diamond wear. The paper presents a fast method for estimating diamond indenters' tip nano and micro geometry. This method {{is based on a}} combination of nanoindentations on Si(100), used as reference material, with FEM supported calculations of Martens hardness. The hardness calculations are conducted using an equivalent indenter tip geometry with geometrical characteristics, which may vary for a specific set of parameters, describing the real indenter with manufacturing imperfections. These parameters are varied in successive iterations until the calculated hardness converges with that of the reference material. For a quick determination of these parameters, the software package "TIDE" (Tip Deviations Estimation) has been developed. "TIDE" is based on numerous FEM supported simulation results of nanoindentations, conducted on the reference material, varying the indenter tip geometry. By this software package, a quick prediction of nanoindenters' tip equivalent geometry is facilitated, also for anticipating changes due to wear of the diamond over time...|$|R

40|$|Failure modes for {{sandwich}} {{beams of}} GFRP laminate skins and Nomex honeycomb core are investigated. Theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under 3 -point bending, is constructed, showing {{the dependence of}} failure mode and load on the ratio of skin thickness to span length and honeycomb relative density. Beam specimens are tested in 3 -point bending. The effect of honeycomb direction is also examined. The experimental data agree satisfactorily with the theoretical predictions. The results reveal {{the important role of}} core shear in a sandwich beam's bending behaviour and the need for a better understanding of indentation failure mechanism. High order sandwich beam theory (HOSBT) is implemented to extract useful information about the way that sandwich beams respond to localised loads under 3 -point bending. 'High-order' or localised effects relate to the non-linear patterns of the in-plane and vertical displacements fields of the core through its height resulting from the unequal deformations in the loaded and unloaded skins. The localised effects are examined experimentally by Surface Displacement Analysis of video images recorded during 3 -point bending tests. A new parameter based on the intrinsic material and geometric properties of a sandwich beam is introduced to characterise its susceptibility to localised effects. Skin flexural rigidity is shown to {{play a key role in}} determining the way that the top skin allows the external load to pass over the core. Furthermore, the contact stress distribution in the interface between the central roller and the top skin, and its importance to an indentation stress analysis, are investigated. To better model the failure in the core under the vicinity of localised loads, an Arcan- type test rig is used to test honeycomb cores under simultaneous compression and shear loading. The experimental measurements show a linear relationship between the out-of-plane compression and shear in honeycomb cores. This is used to derive a failure criterion for applied shear and compression, which is combined with the high order sandwich beam theory to predict failure caused by localised loads in sandwich beams made of GFRP laminate skins and Nomex honeycomb under 3 -point bending loading. Short beam tests with three different <b>indenter's</b> size are performed on appropriately prepared specimens. Experiments validate the theoretical approach and reveal the nature of pre- and post-failure behaviour of these sandwich beams. HOSBT is used as a compact computational tool to reconstruct failure mode maps for sandwich panels.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to problems, {{processes}} and systems related to the recently developed water powered percussive rock drilling method. The technology, which uses ordinary water to drive down-the-hole hammers, {{has been used to}} produce more than 6 million meters of blast holes within the mining industry. The method has several advantages such as low energy consumption, dust free environment and the capability to drill to virtually any depth. A natural disadvantage of this method is the need for relatively large amounts of preferably high quality water to drive the hammer tool, occasionally also leading to waste disposal problems. To understand the central hammer tool in the system, the function of a 100 mm diameter hammer has been analysed, modelled and simulated. One- dimensional wave propagation theory was used for modelling impacts and axial motions in a drilling system. The rock was assumed to be an elastic- plastic material, where all absorbed energy was used for crush work. Simulation results show good agreement between measured and simulated piston blow frequencies (~ 60 Hz). A disadvantage with the hammer tool’s function is the discontinuous consumption of water, causing large pressure fluctuations in the feed water line. Measurements indicate peak pressures to be ~ 3 to 4 times larger than the lowest pressure. Since large pressure variations increase the risk of mechanical damages, a flexible element (pulsation dampener) to reduce the variations was developed. Test bench experiments show pressure fluctuations reduced by up to 40 % with the prototype dampener. For all drilling methods, an efficient rock penetration process is essential for the methods overall competitiveness. The process is also significant for the dynamic behaviour of the water powered hammer tool, since different rock properties have been shown to cause variations in the piston blow frequency. The general bit-rock impact process is therefore discussed and field measurements of the penetration rate during ~ 115 mm diameter well drilling are presented. A penetration process was also analysed with the assistance of a non-linear explicit FEM code, where the rock material was represented by an established constitutive model. Results show, e. g., the ratio between the <b>indenter’s</b> rebound- and initial kinetic energy to decrease with increased initial energy, where a small part of this initial energy is transmitted by stress waves into the formation. During the penetration process, crushed rock is flushed away with outlet water from the hammer tool, i. e. used particle contaminated drill water should be recycled when the method is used at locations with limited water access and/or when waste disposal is difficult to accomplish. This has resulted in the development and construction of a prototype mobile cleaning system that makes re-use possible. Hence, this system is described together with measured and simulated results of the unit’s cleaning capacity. Another phenomenon during the drilling process is the dissipation of {{a large part of the}} injected borehole energy into heat. The drill water and the formation will therefore be thermally influenced, providing the possibility to evaluate the ground thermal conductivity with the drill work. This new principle is presented in detail, together with an energy balance equation and a heat transfer analysis during drill work. Godkänd; 2004; 20061005 (ysko...|$|R

We wish to find the relations which link the pressure distribution, the resultant forces on the <b>indenters</b> and the penetration {{on the assumption that}} the surfaces are frictionless. For <b>indenters</b> of arbitrary shapes the problem may be solved numerically by using the matrix inversion method, extended to viscoelastic cases [1]. But when the problem involves a large number of points the matrix inversion method can become very time-consuming. Here the problem is solved using an alternative scheme, called the two-scale iterative method. In this method the local matrix inversion method is used at the micro-scale for each contact area to compute the pressure distribution taking into account interacting effect (the forces on the other contact areas which can be calculated at the macro-scale) between <b>indenters.</b> Two algorithms were proposed. The first algorithm takes into account the distribution of forces on the other contact areas and the second is the approximation of the first algorithm and takes into account the resultant forces on the other contact areas.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a part of a European {{research}} project named “Prolonging life time of old steel and steel-concrete bridges” or simply “PROLIFE”. As the name indicates the purpose is to strengthen existing bridges. The part of the project that this thesis deals with is developing and testing a new innovative friction grip connection being used to connect a truss with the bottom flanges of beams in order to make two or more beams to act like a steel box girder. The thesis also evaluates the friction grip connection experimentally at the research facility Complab, the largest laboratory at Luleå University of Technology. By increasing the effective friction coefficient the entire friction connection can withstand larger shear forces. The hypothesis is to increase the friction coefficient between the plates in a lap connection by inserting small <b>indenters</b> between the plates. In this thesis three types of <b>indenters</b> have been used, aluminium oxide, stainless steel and tungsten carbide. All types of <b>indenters</b> have been tested in a compression test between two plates. The aluminium oxide and stainless steel indenter types have also been loaded in shear in a friction connection after compression of the two plates. The necessary pre-load to impress an indenter of 2. 5 mm in diameter 2. 3 mm into two plates is 11 kN. The remaining 0. 2 mm gap between the plates is due to the crater developed at an impression point. The protruding edges of craters on opposite plates are brought into contact with each other at 2. 3 mm indentation. The aluminium oxide increases friction but the effect is inconsistent and uncertain, since the <b>indenters</b> are crushed and indenting is not identical between different tests. With small <b>indenters</b> made of stainless steel the effective friction coefficient (µ) of the friction connection can also be improved. How much (µ) can be increased by small <b>indenters</b> in a friction connection depends on the existing surface condition or treatment of the plates in a joint. The tests indicate that the effect of the <b>indenters</b> almost equals that of a shot or grit blasted surface with loose rust removed and no pitting. A connection with <b>indenters</b> provides further a certain safety against overloading and the definition of the procedure is unambiguous. In a reference test with just as rolled surface conditions and no <b>indenters,</b> the slip resistance was 54. 5 kN and the effective friction coefficient μ= 0. 09. With 58 <b>indenters</b> and an M 30 bolt with a pre-loading force of 320 kN the slip resistance can be expected to slightly exceed 250 kN and the effective friction coefficient to be somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 40, at the acceptable slip of 0. 15 mm, according to the current Eurocode standard. The slip resistance from the tests with different number of <b>indenters</b> and without <b>indenters</b> is shown in Figure 36 and Figure 37. Without the slip criterion the expected slip resistance for the same configuration can be 310 kN and the effective friction coefficient somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 50. See Figure 39.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of different types}} of rigid hemispherical and conical <b>indenters</b> on a rectangular specimen of aluminium has been investigated, in the small indenter test. A 3 -D finite-element FE model was used to carry out the computation of the elastic-plastic solution of different rigid hemispherical and conical <b>indenters.</b> Three hemispherical-headed and four conical-headed <b>indenters</b> were designed and developed for testing. FE software ABAQUS® has been used to determine the load vs. indenter-displacement curves, reaction forces, deformation contours and Von-Mises stresses. The FE model was validated by comparing the results with the experimental data received from the Hertz Contact Theory and was found to be in reasonably good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{discrete}} dislocation {{simulations of}} indentation in the sub-micron range are presented for wedge <b>indenters</b> {{with a sharp}} tip and for <b>indenters</b> with a circular tip. Plane strain calculations are carried out for single crystals that are initially free of mobile dislocations and with all dislocations nucleating from a specified distribution of internal sources. The hardness is {{expressed in terms of}} the indentation force divided by the actual contact area accounting for roughness of the surface in contact with the indenter. For wedge <b>indenters</b> the hardness is found to decrease with increasing indentation depth, while for <b>indenters</b> with a circular tip the hardness increases somewhat with increasing indentation depth. However, at a given indentation depth, the indentation hardness of circular <b>indenters</b> increases with decreasing tip radius. The difference in hardness evolution for the two tip shapes is mainly due to {{the manner in which the}} evolution of the contact area depends on indenter tip shape. The nominal hardness, i. e. that based on the geometric contact area neglecting material sink-in or pile-up and surface roughness, is found to follow the inverse square root size dependence earlier predicted, even though the plastic zone found in the simulations differs significantly in shape and size from that assumed in deriving the scaling laws. ...|$|E
