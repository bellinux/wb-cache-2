40|$|This honors thesis {{will examine}} the {{potential}} role and influence of the Higg Index scores, introduced by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) on sustainable consumption habits. The SAC {{continue to work on}} the Higg modules, from which the scores are generated, but it hasn’t done any substantial consumer related studies. This thesis makes first steps towards evaluation of the Higg Index scores in the development of sustainable consumption habits. As a preliminary study, I wrote a survey to see if apparel consumers from the state of Colorado would express an interest in the scores on the apparel <b>hangtags</b> and if they were willing to pay more for an increase {{in the value of the}} scores. The survey results, model runs, and other similar studies indicate that the majority of consumers support the concept of sustainable apparel and have already developed sustainable habits, thus the scores can influence them to buy and spend more on sustainable apparel that have higher scores. When the scores are released to the public, it’s important for the marketing teams to educate consumers who haven’t developed yet their sustainable habits on the purpose of the scores...|$|R

Background and {{motivation}} Clothing labels concern the permanently attached labels {{as well as}} the temporarily attached labels known as <b>hangtags</b> that are found on clothing products. Clothing labels assist consumers when they are deciding whether or not to purchase clothing products, by providing product information and potential care instructions. Clothing labels are made up of two attributes, namely the physical nature of clothing labels in addition to the information on clothing labels. Adequate knowledge, positive perceptions and optimal use of clothing labels may result in satisfied consumers who make responsible and informed purchases. The aim of this study was subsequently, to determine male and female consumers’ knowledge, perceptions and use of clothing labels. The provision of clothing labels does not guarantee that consumers will read, understand or apply the information on clothing labels. Therefore this research is based on retailers’ assumption that the provision of informative clothing labels is sufficient to encourage the usage thereof and that all consumers understand and perceive the clothing labels as intended. Due to the lack of research that exists in South Africa in the field of clothing labels, it is not known whether consumers have adequate knowledge and positive perceptions of clothing labels and the information on them, and whether they use the labels optimally. Methodology The research design of this study was non–experimental, quantitative, exploratory, and descriptive. Questionnaires were used as the measuring instrument to collect the data. The study population included all the consumers in three municipalities in the North–West Province above the age of 18 years, male as well as female, who can read and who had purchased a clothing product some time from one of the selected stores. Data collection was undertaken in the Bonjana, Platinum and Southern district municipalities, which included, Rustenburg, Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom. A total of 304 usable questionnaires were obtained. Results and discussion On average 71 % of the respondents had adequate knowledge of the information presented on clothing labels (excluding the care instructions) and 65. 6 % had adequate knowledge regarding the care instructions. Respondents perceived colours in general (79. 9 %), letter size (83 %) and readability (77. 7 %) of information on clothing labels as positive. They found it very important that the information on clothing labels will not fade (68. 8 %), and that the positioning remains constant (78. 8 %), in addition to not showing (84. 9 %). Respondents perceived the indication of information on clothing as positive, regarding the fibre content (84. 2 %), country of origin (61. 2 %), size indication (89. 5 %) as well as additional information, such as applied special finishes (76. 4 %) and indication of eco friendly clothing (69. 5 %) and licensed trade marks (78 %). Respondents sufficiently made use of the care instructions in words (68. 1 %) and symbols (63. 2 %) when purchasing similar items. More than half (56. 9 %) of the respondents used the indication of special finishes applied to clothing during the pre– and post purchasing phase. The indication of eco friendly clothing was used by the respondents (51 %) for future reference and 63. 5 % made use of the licensed trademarks when purchasing similar products. In conclusion the results generally indicated that the respondents had adequate knowledge and positive perceptions of clothing labels, and made use of clothing labels before, during and after purchasing clothing products. Furthermore only small {{significant differences were found between}} male and female respondents’ knowledge, perceptions and use of clothing labels. It was established that relationships do exist between respondents’ knowledge, perceptions and use of clothing labels. Master...|$|R
50|$|AATCC 183 {{should be}} used in {{conjunction}} with other related standards including ASTM D 6544 and ASTM D 6603. ASTM D 6544 specifies simulating the life cycle of a fabric so that a UPF test can be done {{near the end of the}} fabric's life, when it typically provides the least UV protection. ASTM D 6603 is a consumer format recommended for visible <b>hangtag</b> and care labeling of sun protective clothing and textiles. A manufacturer may publish a test result to a maximum of UPF 50+.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{the term}} pashmina to describe an ultra fine cashmere fiber; others {{use the term}} to describe a blend of cashmere and silk. The FTC encourages manufacturers and sellers of products described as pashmina to explain to consumers, on a <b>hangtag,</b> for example, what they mean by the term.As with all other wool products, the fiber content of a shawl, scarf or other item marketed as pashmina must be accurately disclosed. For example, a blend of cashmere and silk might be labeled 50% Cashmere, 50% Silk or 70% Cashmere, 30% Silk, depending upon the actual cashmere and silk content. If the item contains only cashmere, it should be labeled 100% Pashmina or All Cashmere, by the Wool Act or regulations.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{looks into}} what information consumers {{are interested in}} on hangtags in regards to what they would purchase. More specifically, it looks at the water treatment at the factory the apparel product that the <b>hangtag</b> is on is from. Participants were given a survey {{and a picture of}} one of three hangtags. One <b>hangtag</b> had information about wastewater recycling at the factory, one had information about the factory effluent and the last was the control with no extra information. The results of the survey showed that if participants saw either a <b>hangtag</b> with information about wastewater recycling or factory effluent then they had a more positive attitude, subjective norm and perceived control and may have a higher purchase intention. This is important because putting information about the environment on hangtags {{is a good way to}} inform consumers about it. If a company sees that it will make a consumer more inclined to buy the product, then they are more willing to put environmental information on a <b>hangtag.</b> Consumer education is important for a more environmentally friendly industry...|$|E
