5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The <b>Federal</b> <b>party</b> platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland formed the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in August 1953, Huggins became the amalgamated body's first Prime Minister. Salisbury was {{designated}} the Federal capital, and the United Party renamed itself the United Rhodesia Party. Garfield Todd {{took over as}} Southern Rhodesia's Prime Minister. Huggins headed the Federal government for three years, then retired in November 1956 after a combined 23 years as a national leader. The United Rhodesia Party merged with the <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> to become the United <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> (UFP) in November 1957, and the liberal Todd was voted out of office by the more right-wing members of his party four months later, in February 1958. He was replaced by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Todd led {{his own version of}} the United Rhodesia Party against the UFP and the Dominion Party in June the same year, but failed to win a single seat—the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, with the Dominion Party taking the remainder.|$|E

This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a splitone half of the party decided to merge with the UNP {{and the other half}} decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the <b>Federal</b> <b>party.</b> Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike, made the <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> the main voice of Tamil politics. Increased racial and political tension between the two communities led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front. This was followed by the emergence of a militant, armed form of Tamil nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the <b>Federal</b> <b>party</b> in such matters.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{independence}} in 1948, G. G. Ponnambalam and his All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined D. S. Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government {{which led to}} a split in the Tamil Congress. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party. In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of May–June 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes. Another point of conflict between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the demographic balance in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.|$|E
5|$|Saskatchewan Conservatives {{eventually}} {{arranged a}} leadership convention for October 28, 1936. Eleven people were nominated, including Diefenbaker. The other ten candidates all deemed the provincial party in such hopeless shape that they withdrew, and Diefenbaker won the position by default. Diefenbaker asked the <b>federal</b> <b>party</b> for $10,000 in financial support, but the funds were refused, and the Conservatives were {{shut out of}} the legislature in the 1938 provincial elections for the second consecutive time. Diefenbaker himself was defeated in the Arm River riding by 190 votes. With the province-wide Conservative vote having fallen to 12%, Diefenbaker offered his resignation to a post-election party meeting in Moose Jaw, but it was refused. Diefenbaker continued to run the provincial party out of his law office, and paid the party's debts from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{completed}} his studies at Rhodes during 1946, and entered politics in 1948 when he successfully contested the Selukwe seat {{on behalf of}} the Liberal Party, becoming his home town's representative in the Legislative Assembly at the age of 29. He rose through the political ranks with the United <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> during the 1950s, and in 1962 helped to form the Rhodesian Front, a right-wing party whose avowed goal was full independence from Britain without an immediate transfer to black majority rule. He became Deputy Prime Minister in December that year when the new party, led by Winston Field, surprised most observers by winning that month's election. After the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964, following his failure to gain independence from Britain, they chose Smith as the new Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Trudeau's {{successor}} as Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, and Quebec Liberal premier Robert Bourassa {{sought a}} series of Constitutional amendments designed to address Quebec's concerns. In {{what became known as}} the Meech Lake Accord, the Federal government and all provincial premiers agreed to {{a series of}} amendments that decentralized some powers and recognized Quebec as forming a distinct society. The Accord, after fierce debate in English Canada, fell apart in dramatic fashion in the summer of 1990, prompting outrage in Quebec and a surge in support for sovereignty. While the Accord was collapsing, Lucien Bouchard, a cabinet minister in Mulroney's government, led a coalition of Progressive Conservative and Liberal members of parliament from Quebec to form a new <b>federal</b> <b>party</b> devoted to Quebec sovereignty, the Bloc Québécois.|$|E
5|$|Born into an {{expatriate}} Ceylon Tamil {{family in}} Malaya, Chelvanayakam moved to Ceylon while still young. He {{worked as a}} teacher before studying law at Ceylon Law College and qualifying as lawyer. A successful career in civil law saw him becoming a King's Counsel and being offered {{a position on the}} Supreme Court, which he rejected. As a young lawyer Chelvanayakam was not involved in politics but when the British established the Soulbury Commission to look into constitutional reform in Ceylon he and other Tamil people formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests. He was elected to Parliament in 1947 to represent Kankesanthurai, a constituency he would represent until his death, except for a period between 1952 and 1956. Chelvanayakam left the ACTC over the party's decision to join the government and in 1949 founded his own party, ITAK, also known as the <b>Federal</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries the British {{recruited}} {{large numbers}} of South Indians, primarily Indian Tamils, to work in tea, coffee, rubber and coconut plantations in Ceylon. Ceylon's majority Sinhalese viewed Indian Tamils with deep suspicion, fearing that they would dominate the island's central highlands and ally themselves with the indigenous Ceylon Tamils, increasing the latter's political strength. Following independence from Britain in February 1948, Ceylon's Sinhalese dominated government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Bill which {{had the effect of}} denying citizenship and making stateless the country's Indian Tamils, who by now accounted for 11% of the population. The bill provided for citizenship by descent or registration but both required documentary proof, something that was difficult for most Indian Tamils, many of whom were illiterate. The ACTC opposed the bill which was passed by Parliament at its second reading on 20 August 1948. Shortly afterwards Ponnambalam decided to join the United National Party (UNP) led government which caused a split in the ACTC. Eventually the ACTC dissidents, led by Chelvanayakam, E. M. V. Naganathan and C. Vanniasingam formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK, <b>Federal</b> <b>Party)</b> on 18 December 1949.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was born}} to British {{immigrants}} in Selukwe, {{a small town in}} the Southern Rhodesian Midlands, four years before the colony became self-governing in 1923. Serving as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War, he spent months behind German lines in Italy and suffered debilitating facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous {{for the rest of his}} life. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948 and, the same year, became Member of Parliament for Selukwe—at 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a Liberal, he defected to the United <b>Federal</b> <b>Party</b> in 1953, and served as Chief Whip from 1958 onwards. He left in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and the following year helped Winston Field to form the all-White, firmly conservative Rhodesian Front (RF), which called for independence without an immediate shift to Black majority rule.|$|E
5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the <b>Federal</b> <b>Party.</b> However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E
25|$|G. G. Ponnambalam, the Tamil {{nationalist}} {{counterpart of}} S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, founded the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) in 1944. Objecting to Ponnambalam's cooperation with D. S.

Their popularity grew in Quebec, leading to Western supporters of Social Credit feeling isolated by the <b>federal</b> <b>party's</b> Quebec nationalism.
