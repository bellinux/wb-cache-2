50|$|The {{secret of}} Hegel may be {{indicated}} at shortest thus: As Aristotle—with considerable assistance from Plato—made explicit the abstract Universal that <b>was</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> Socrates, so Hegel— with less considerable assistance from Fichte and Schelling—made explicit the concrete Universal that <b>was</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> Kant.|$|R

25|$|The 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: “Without Contraries is no progression” - {{and this}} idea <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> {{many of the}} poems. The {{last part of the}} book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane. By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision {{revealed}} in the vine / And the leaves of the Shining Tree...') evokes the Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.|$|E
25|$|The One {{acts as the}} {{determining}} factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its indeterminacy, which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and smallness or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{historic}} Sunni scholars who permitted the Mawlid include the Shafi'i scholar Al-Suyuti (d 911 A.H.) who stated that:My {{answer is that}} the legal status of the observance of the Mawlid – as long as it just consists of a meeting together by the people, a recitation of apposite parts of the Qur'an, the recounting of transmitted accounts of the beginning of (the biography of) the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and the wonders that took place during his birth, all of which is then followed by a banquet that is served to them and from which they eat-is a good innovation (bid'a hasana), for which one is rewarded because of the esteem shown for the position of the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – that <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> it, and because of the expression of joy and happiness on his – may God bless him and grant him peace – noble birth.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about [...] away, near the village of Fence.|$|E

2500|$|Sources for British Empire {{casualties}} are divergent and contradictory. The {{report of}} the War Office published in 1922 put {{the total number of}} British Empire [...] "soldiers who lost their lives" [...] at 908,371. On a separate schedule the War Office listed the losses of the Royal Navy at 32,237 dead and missing. It <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> this presentation that the figures for [...] "soldiers who lost their lives" [...] do not include the Royal Navy. However many published reference works list total British Empire(including the Dominions) losses at 908,371, it <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> these presentations that the figures for total losses include the Royal Navy.|$|E

2500|$|The Nicene Creed of 325 {{explicitly}} {{affirms the}} co-essential divinity of the Son, applying {{to him the}} term [...] "consubstantial". The 381 version speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son. The Athanasian Creed (not used in Eastern Christianity) describes in much greater detail the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Apostles' Creed makes no explicit statements about the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit, but, {{in the view of}} many who use it, the doctrine <b>is</b> <b>implicit</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E
