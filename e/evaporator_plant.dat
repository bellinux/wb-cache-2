40|$|Falling film {{evaporators}} {{are commonly}} used in the New Zealand dairy industry {{for the production of}} milk powders. Milk powder is not susceptible to bacterial damage and it is easy to transport, whereas milk itself has neither of these characteristics. As a result milk powders are an ideal export product for the New Zealand Dairy industry. However, despite their large amount of industrial use, {{there is a shortage of}} knowledge on the design, operation and control of falling film evaporators. The work discussed in this thesis was initiated with the aim of improving this situation. The aims of this work are split into three broad areas. Develop Model A first principles model for the Evaporator A plant at Kiwi Co-op Dairies will be developed from the Laws of Thermodynamics. The model is dynamic and includes the evaporator preheat sections. We will concentrate on developing the model for the subsequent analysis of the Evaporator A plant. Specifically, a steady state model will be developed for the optimisation/operation studies and a linear dynamic model for the controllability studies. Optimisation Studies Using the steady state model the operation/optimisation of the Evaporator A plant will be investigated. There are some simple aspects of the evaporator and preheat sections that will be discussed. However, an important aspect will be the evaporator operational optimisation with respect to energy costs, fouling, throughput and milk powder quality. Controllability Studies Using the dynamic model we will investigate the control of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>plant.</b> The dynamic model derived from first principles will be linearised to produce a linear constant coefficient dynamic model.

Such natural or wild brine pumping differs from controlled brine pumping, where water is pumped underground into rock to dissolve rock salt deposits. The process has historically been associated with subsidence, {{which has been a}} major problem in the Northwich area. The brine was purified by treatment with sodium carbonate and lime, and the salt extracted using a closed-pan partial vacuum evaporation method. The technique was adapted from the sugar industry, and had first been applied to salt extraction in 1887 in Silver Springs, New York. First tried commercially in the UK as early as 1901, several British manufacturers started up vacuum <b>evaporator</b> <b>plants</b> using a small Mirlees-type evaporator in parallel with their open-pan operations after the First World War.

In design of compact heat exchangers, passive techniques of heat transfer augmentation can play an important role if a proper passive insert configuration can be selected according to the heat exchanger working condition (both flow and heat transfer conditions). In the past decade, several studies on the passive techniques of heat transfer augmentation have been reported. Twisted tapes, wire coils, ribs, fins, dimples, etc., are the most commonly used passive heat transfer augmentation tools. In the present paper, emphasis is given to works dealing with different shapes of ribs, and there arrangement because, according to recent studies, these are known to be economic heat transfer augmentation tools.

The experimental part was carried out at a falling film pilot <b>plant</b> <b>evaporator</b> at the division of Heat and Power Technology at Chalmers University of Technology.

During washing the outgoing dry solid content of the wash liquid was measured along with the scaling layer thickness. The dissolution rate constant {{was found to be}} lower than in previous research carried out by dissolution with water at corresponding temperature and flow rate. The dissolution was dependant on the concentration difference between the saturation concentration and the concentration of the bulk liquid, the flow rate and the temperature of the washing liquid. The dissolution seems to be decreasing with increasing viscosity, but since temperature affects the viscosity, the solubility and the dissolution rate constant the effect of only the viscosity cannot be confirmed. In contrast to previous work the results suggests that the amount of wash liquid needed to dissolve a given amount of scales decreased with increasing temperature and flow which suggest that there might be beneficial to wash at a high wetting degree and at a high temperature...|$|R

In this work, the sodium scale dissolution rate has been experimentally investigated and {{a model for the}} dissolution process has been developed. The aim was to relate the dissolution rate to wetting degree and temperature of the wash liquid. The experiments were conducted in a pilot <b>plant</b> <b>evaporator</b> of the falling film type. A saline solution consisting of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate was evaporated on the outside of a vertical stainless steel tube. The removal of the resulting scaling layer was then studied at different temperatures and wetting degrees. An effective method for investigating the removal of sodium scales in falling film evaporators was developed and a model was constructed that successfully could predict the obtained experimental data. The washing behaviour proved to be strongly dependent on how the scales were distributed along the tube. It was confirmed that scales grow {{from the bottom of the}} tube and upwards until the layer reaches an equilibrium thickness. The dissolution rate was found to follow a 1 st order expression with regards to the concentration difference between the scaling layer surface and the bulk of the wash liquid. The model was developed in the temperature interval 45 85 °C and wetting degrees of 0. 13 kg/ms up to 0. 44 kg/ms.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 117 - 125. Falling {{commodity}} prices {{have reduced the}} profit margins of Southern African sugar producers. Although these price falls have been severe, they reflect a long-term trend of reducing margins for basic commodity producers during the 20 th Century. This trend has forced. producers to closely examine their processes and to look for areas in which improvements in productivity, yield and efficiency can be achieved. Evaporation is the most energy intensive unit operation in the sugar factory, and it {{is responsible for the}} removal of most of the water from sugar solution, or juice, which is extracted from the sugar cane. There is also a large potential to lose sucrose at the evaporators due to the high temperatures and long residence times employed there. The smooth control of the evaporators is thus vital to consistent factory operation, and the evaporators are commonly a sugar factory bottleneck. This study developed a control strategy for the particular evaporator configuration found at Triangle Sugar Mill in south eastern Zimbabwe. There are currently several evaporator control strategies being used in the sugar industry. Most of these are an assembly of single loop Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, which cannot optimally account for the interactions encountered in most evaporator stations. Ideally, any evaporator control system should be able to handle the multiple input multiple output problem while anticipating and handling constraints on inputs and outputs. Several multivariable approaches have been tried, but these usually require a great deal of expensive instrumentation. After a review of the multivariable control literature and testing of several alternative control systems, Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) was chosen as the bestwsuited control algorithm for the Triangle control problem. A dynamic model of the Triangle evaporator station was, developed to formulate and test the DMC and other controllers. The model was based on a set of differential equations involving mass and energy balances through the <b>evaporators.</b> Real <b>plant</b> data were collected from the SCADA system and the model was tested against this data. After validation the model was. used to record step responses of the process to key input variables. The control system had nine (9) measurable inputs, and three (3) controlled outputs. The objective of the control system was to deliver the maximum amount of consistently high quality symp, within plant constraints. This was formulated in an objective function which seeks to minimize a weighted sum of the errors of syrup concentration from a setpoint, and the fluctuations in juice flowrates.

A {{need was}} {{identified}} {{for a set}} of basic design tools for Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) <b>plant</b> <b>evaporators.</b> This led to an investigation into the different types of evaporators as well as further research on horizontal falling film evaporators as used in the MED process. It also included the theory on these types of evaporators. In order not to duplicate existing design tools, an investigation was also performed on some of the tools that are currently available. The first set of tools that were developed were tools, programmed in EES (Engineering Equation Solver), for the vacuum system and the evaporator. These programs can be used to simulate different parameters (like different mass flows and temperatures). That enables the correct selection of components for the vacuum system and can be used to address sizing issues around the evaporator. It {{can also be used to}} plan the layout of the plant. The second of the design tools was developed by designing and building a flow pattern test section. From the flow pattern test section a set of curves for the wetted length under different conditions was obtained which can be used in order to design the sieve tray. This set of curves was found to be accurate for municipal as well as seawater and can be used in the design of the sieve tray of the evaporator. Further development can be done by implementing the figures of the wetted length into a simulation package like, for example, Flownex (a system CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that enables users to perform detail design, analysis and optimization of a wide range of thermal-fluid systems). The background gained from the study done on the evaporator can also be implemented into such a package. This could solve the problem of different design packages by creating a single design package with all of the above mentioned options included. Master...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{feasibility}} of using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in trigeneration plants is examined through thermodynamic modeling and thermoeconomic optimization. Three novel trigeneration systems are considered. Each one of these systems consists of an ORC, a heating-process heat exchanger, and a single-effect absorption chiller. The three systems are distinguished by {{the source of the}} heat input to the ORC. The systems considered are SOFC-trigeneration, biomass- trigeneration, and solar-trigeneration systems. For each system four cases are considered: electrical-power, cooling-cogeneration, heating-cogeneration, and trigeneration cases. Comprehensive thermodynamic analysis on each system is carried out. Furthermore, thermoeconomic optimization is conducted. The objective of the thermoeconomic optimization is to minimize the cost per exergy unit of the trigeneration product. The results of the thermoeconomic optimization are used to compare the three systems through thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analyses. This study illustrates key output parameters to assess the trigeneration systems considered. These parameters are energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, net electrical power, electrical to cooling ratio, and electrical to heating ratio. Moreover, exergy destruction modeling is conducted to identify and quantify the major sources of exergy destruction in the systems considered. In addition, an environmental impact assessment is conducted to quantify the amount of CO 2 emissions in the systems considered. Furthermore, this study examines both the cost rate and cost per exergy unit of the electrical power and other trigeneration products. This study reveals that there is a considerable efficiency improvement when trigeneration is used, as compared to only electrical power production. In addition, the emissions of CO 2 per MWh of trigeneration are significantly lower than that of electrical power. It was shown that the exergy destruction rates of the ORC evaporators for the three systems are quite high. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} using more efficient ORC <b>evaporators</b> in trigeneration <b>plants.</b> In addition, this study reveals that the SOFC-trigeneration system has the highest electrical energy efficiency while the biomass-trigeneration system and the solar mode of the solar trigeneration system have the highest trigeneration energy efficiencies. In contrast, the SOFC-trigeneration system has the highest exergy efficiency for both electrical and trigeneration cases. Furthermore, the thermoeconomic optimization shows that the solar-trigeneration system has the lowest cost per exergy unit. Meanwhile the solar-trigeneration system has zero CO 2 emissions and depends on a free renewable energy source. Therefore, it can be concluded that the solar-trigeneration system has the best thermoeconomic performance among the three systems considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether the behaviour of thermophilic bacteria growing as biofilms would change after being subjected to temperature cycling. It was used to test the practicality of a temperature cycling method for use in the heat transfer sections (milk pre-heaters and <b>evaporators)</b> of dairy <b>plants</b> for reducing the biofilm growth of thermophilic bacteria. Biofilms may protect bacterial cells from cleaning-in-place operations (CIP). CIP is the standard technique for cleaning dairy plant in New Zealand (AS/NZS 2541, 1998). If the temperature cycling method is used in the heat transfer sections of dairy plants, surviving thermophilic bacteria in the form of biofilms may be continuously exposed to the temperature cycling environment; thus a sub-population which is resistant to temperature cycling may adhere in greater numbers or grow more efficiently under the selective conditions. Wild-type strains of Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Anoxybacillus flavithermus were isolated from a commercial milk powder sample obtained from a milk powder production plant in New Zealand. These two wild-type strains were subjected to a temperature cycling regime consisting of 55 ºC for 15 minutes then 35 ºC for 35 minutes for 192 hours using a modified Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler and hexagonal flat stainless steel reactors. At the end of each of four serial experiments, sub-population isolates for both species were obtained from the effluent milk. Wild-type strains and the sub-population strains of these two organisms were tested for the ability to adhere and grow as biofilms on stainless steel surfaces by using a Centre for Disease Control (CDC) biofilm reactor. The cell counts per unit area of adhesion, maximum specific growth rates (μmax) of the biofilms, and cells released in out-flowing milk were measured. The analysed data of the wild-type strain and the sub-population strain of each organism were compared by using p-value of 2 samples t-test statistical analysis to check whether the strains had adapted to the temperature cycling treatment. The results showed that the ability of planktonic cells of the wild-type A. flavithermus strain to adhere to stainless steel surfaces was significantly changed with p-value = 0. 001 (0. 05). In contrast, the sub-population of G. stearothermophilus was significantly different from the wild-type after being subjected to 192 hours temperature cycling. The G. stearothermophilus sub-population strain was more resistant to temperature cycling, having a greater ability to adhere (p-value = 0. 000 < 0. 05) and grow as a biofilm (p-value = 0. 008 < 0. 05) than the wild-type strain. Since G. stearothermophilus is a common contaminant in dairy plants, the temperature cycling method may not be a viable long-term solution for dairy plants for reducing the growth rates of thermophilic bacteria, and further studies, such as different temperature profiles both in terms of magnitude and duration, are required...|$|R

Mr. Vander Hooven flew to Kentucky to personally oversee the demonstration of the product which is used after a slick is contained by means of a floating boom. O ilblotter, which is non-toxic and subject to normal organic decomposition, absorbs oil immediately upon contact and is then skimmed off for burning or other means of disposal. Affiliated with The Andersons of Maumee, the Ander­son Cob Mills, Inc., are primary producers of a versatile, tough-textured natural cellulose grit derived from corn cobs, which is used in a number of manu­facturing processes including de-burring, burnishing and finishing metal parts, blast cleaning, and as carriers of agricultural chemicals. Grit-O-Cobs and Lite-R-Cobs, registered trade names, are also used by foundries, fur cleaners and cosmetic manufacturers. DWARF APPLE TREES Techniques for dwarfing apple trees have produced modern orchards that cost no more to get into pro­duction than standard trees, but give growers more apples per tree. Michigan State University horticulturists are testing and improving these techniques. FAT RATS STUDIED Sterility is a common condition in overweight animals and human beings. To find out why this is true, Michigan State University foods and nutrition research­ers are. conducting basic studies of fat rats to determine why obesity affects reproduction and sex hormones. CHEMICAL MAY HELP CHERRY HARVEST A Michigan State University horticulturist has found a chemiool that coutd make mechanical harvesting practical for sweet cherries. By applying the experiment­al chemical, 2 -chloroethylthosphonic acid, as a foliar spray 7 to 10 days before harvest, the force needed to remove the fruit is cut in half. Thus, the chemical might make it possible to mechanically harvest sweet cherries with very little damage to the fruit. Annual Sugar Beet Field Tour Held Recently In Oh io Areas The Farmers' and Manufacturers' Beet Sugar Associ· ation of Saginaw, Michigan, held its annual sugar beet field tour i. n the Fremont and Findlay, Ohio areas recently, reports Glenn E. Maddy, county extension agent. They visited the sugar beet fields of Melvin Schulte, Woodville; Carl and Theodore Kaiser of Graytown; Wilson Damschroder, Lindsey; Rollin Turnow, Curtice; Harold Draeger, Lindsey; Emil Webert, Elmore, and toured the new additions to the Fremont factory of the Northern Ohio Sugar Company. The main items observed were the planting of beets to a stand-that is, the farmer planted beets at the rate of four seeds per foot with no blocking done. The weed control material was Pyramin+ TCA. Then in many of the cases, they had labor removing the weeds with long· handled hoes. This is a very common practice in Michigan, the planting of beets to stand without using labor. The Kaiser Brothers used a John Deere electronic thinner to remove their excess beets. The beets were planted at two inches apart, and then were reduced to approximately one foot apart. This thinning mach­ine can do two acres per hour. The machine covers six rows at a time.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has greatly increased its spray drying capacity {{in response to the}} world market demand for spray dried milk products. Powder specifications are becoming increasingly complex and smaller quantities of each product are required as the number of different products grows. These factors have made it necessary {{to learn more about the}} way processing variables influence the product quality in order to improve product quality control. A computer simulation model providing a complete description of the drier behaviour was developed from a series of experiments on a pilot scale spray drier. This took the form of regression equations relating the quality parameters of skim milk powder to the drier operating variables and the composition and physical properties of the skim milk. The model was then used in the development of a quality control system and also to simulate and evaluate a variety of commercial operating practices. The characteristics of the spray drying process were investigated using the pilot <b>plant</b> <b>evaporator</b> and spray drier at the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute, which had been fully instrumented and interfaced to a process control computer. The drier studies confirmed the importance of low concentrate viscosity in the production of good quality milk powder. This could be achieved by keeping concentrate holding times to a minimum and by using high temperature, short time preheat treatments. The protein content of the skim milk was found to be the major determinant in the seasonal changes observed in concentrate viscosity, high protein contents giving high viscosities. The study of the hydrodynamics of centrifugal pressure nozzle atomisers revealed that the nozzles used in milk powder drying fall into two distinct categories, each with characteristic behaviour in response to variations in fluid viscosity. The magnitude of the viscosity effect depends on the ratio of the swirl chamber and orifice diameters. The large capacity nozzles used in tall-form driers exhibit a marked decrease in pressure drop at constant flowrate as the viscosity of the concentrate fed to them is increased. This was found to play a very important part in determining the overall behaviour of the drier. Five operating variables; the inlet air temperature and the concentrate total solids, feedrate, atomising pressure and temperature, proved to be necessary and sufficient to describe the drier performance and to predict the properties of the powder. Simulation studies of two outlet air temperature control strategies clearly demonstrated the superiority of inlet air temperature manipulation over that of concentrate feedrate, for driers employing large capacity nozzles. The drier model was used in the selection, tuning and evaluation of a quality control system based on the SIMPLEX Evolutionary Operation scheme of Spendley et al. The process of spray drying milk powders presents several control problems. There are a number of quality parameters assessed by laboratory analysis, which means that feedback is multivariable, delayed and subject to error. Furthermore, the processing characteristics of milk change with time. A single measure of the powder quality was obtained from penalty functions based on economic considerations. After selection of the SIMPLEX step sizes with the help of simulation model, a pilot plant trial of the scheme was conducted. The Simplex evolutionary operation method was found to be a simple robust procedure which rapidly improved the product quality and maintained it in the face of disturbances typical of those likely to occur in commercial operation. The method provides two sets of plant conditions in advance, a feature which permits a substantial increase in the speed of attainment of optimum conditions for processes with setpoint response times similar to the time required to analyse the product quality. The Simplex method is therefore particularly suited to the manufacture of spray dried milk powders...|$|R
