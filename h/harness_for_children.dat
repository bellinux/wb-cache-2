50|$|Different {{types of}} {{climbing}} warrant particular features <b>for</b> <b>harnesses.</b> Sport climbers typically use minimalistic harnesses, some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight harnesses, perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body <b>harnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>children,</b> whose pelvises {{may be too}} narrow to support a standard harness safely. These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured <b>for</b> <b>children</b> or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses {{when there is a}} chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness; this combination provides the same advantages as a full body harness. However, test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses can put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, making them slightly more dangerous to use.|$|R
5000|$|The five-point harness is {{also used}} to buckle up {{children}} in forward-facing and rear-facing seats. It is designed with the same concept of tightly holding the passenger to the seat with the use of five different straps but built <b>for</b> the young <b>children.</b> This form of seat <b>harness</b> <b>for</b> young <b>children</b> [...] "should be a default standard" [...] when children are present in a motor vehicle according to Phil Wilson. The reason {{there have been a number}} of injured young children and infants in survivable accidents is due to incorrect use of the Child Safety Seat (CSS).|$|R
