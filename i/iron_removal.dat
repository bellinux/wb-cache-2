40|$|Soluble Fe(II) {{in ground}} water in Denmark is mostly removed {{conventionally}} {{by the simple}} process known as purely physico-chemical (or abiotic). By this process, the raw water is exposed to atmospheric oxygen to oxidise the iron from soluble Fe(II) to insoluble Fe(III) oxides, which is then removed by single or double filtration units, depending on the ground water quality. Ground water containing iron complexed with organic and inorganic materials could be difficult to remove by the purely physico-chemical method.

40|$|The {{principle}} of subsurface <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> for drinking water supply is that aerated water is periodically {{injected into the}} aquifer through a tube well. On {{its way into the}} aquifer, the injected O 2 -rich water oxidizes adsorbed Fe 2 +, creating a subsurface oxidation zone. When groundwater abstraction is resumed, the soluble Fe 2 + is adsorbed and water with reduced Fe concentrations is abstracted for multiple volumes of the injection water. In this article, Fe accumulation deposits in the aquifer near subsurface treatment wells were identified and characterized to assess the sustainability of subsurface <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> regarding clogging of the aquifer and the potential co-accumulation of other groundwater constituents, such as As. Chemical extraction of soil samples, with Acid-Oxalate and HNO 3, showed that Fe had accumulated at specific depths near subsurface <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> wells after 12 years of operation. Whether it was due to preferred flow paths or geochemical mineralogy conditions; subsurface <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> clearly favoured certain soil layers. The total Fe content increased between 11. 5 and 390. 8 mmol/kg ds in the affected soil layers, and the accumulated Fe was found to be 56 - 100 % crystalline. These results suggest that precipitated amorphous Fe hydroxides have transformed to Fe hydroxides of higher crystallinity. These crystalline, compact Fe hydroxides have not noticeably clogged the investigated well and/or aquifer between 1996 and 2008. The subsurface <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> wells even need less frequent rehabilitation, as drawdown increases more slowly than in normal production wells. Other groundwater constituents, such as Mn, As and Sr were found to co-accumulate with Fe. Acid extraction and ESEM-EDX showed that Ca occurred together with Fe and by X-ray Powder Diffraction it was identified as calcite. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviours}} of iron(II) oxidation, iron(III) settling and total <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> from ferruginous circumneutral, {{and to a}} lesser extent, acidic coal mine water discharges from across the globe. Comparisons are drawn between existing iron(II) oxidation and <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> studies and new knowledge is developed in the area of iron(III) settling behaviour, <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> rate-limiting steps and methods to examine the treatability of ferruginous circumneutral mine water. Measured iron(II) oxidation rates are shown to be higher in this study than previous authors’ work, which is likely to be due to higher concentrations of particulate iron(III) present in the mine water that acts to catalyse the oxidation reaction. The iron(III) settling rate constant is shown to be proportional to the initial total iron concentration, however it is also seemingly effected by the concentration of magnesium and calcium present in the mine water. Rates of total <b>iron</b> <b>removal</b> are shown to be in general linearly proportional to the initial total iron concentration due to the acidity of the mine water, and oxidation and settling rate limiting steps, however some data does lie off of the trendline, meaning {{that it would not be}} suitable to be used to predict final total iron concentrations.

The optimum condition for <b>iron</b> (II) <b>removal</b> for commercialized chicken eggshells and hybrid Akar Putra chicken eggshells bio-sorbents reached at 0. 30 g with optimum contact time of 50 minutes and 91. 83 % and 91. 07 % of removal percentage with 0. 60 g at 40 minutes. The final concentration from both bio-sorbents is achieved below than drinking water guideline (0. 30 mg/L), 0. 1635 mg/L and 0. 1785 mg/L, respectively.
