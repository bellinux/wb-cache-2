40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Low Plasticity Burnishing (LPB) to increase the damage tolerance and fatigue strength of a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade that is fatigue life limited by the occurrence of leading edge foreign object damage (FOD) as small as 0. 1 mm (0. 005 in.). The size and location distributions of service generated FOD were documented; no FOD exceeded a depth of 0. 5 mm (0. 020 in.). LPB processing of the fan blade leading edge was therefore designed to provide tolerance of 0. 5 mm deep FOD. A zone of – 100 ksi through-thickness compression was achieved extending back 6. 3 mm chord-wise from the leading edge along {{the lower half of}} the blade from the platform to the mid-span damper. Residual stress distributions were measured as functions of depth and position along the leading edge using x-ray diffraction mapping. HCF testing was with the leading <b>edge</b> <b>cantilever</b> loaded under a sustained mean stress (R= 0. 1). FOD was simulated with 60 -degree “V ” notches machined into the leading edge at the point of maximum applied stress. The 620 MPa (90 ksi) endurance limit of as-received blades was reduced to less than half by 0. 5 mm. FOD. LPB produced an HCF strength of 861 MPa (125 ksi) without FOD, and strengths equal or greater than the as-received blades for FOD up to 1. 3 mm (0. 050 in.) deep- an order of magnitude improvement in damage tolerance. Fatigue life modeling confirmed the HCF strength achieved, and suggests FOD tolerance can be further increased by optimizing the size and shape of the compressive zone...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research has investigated the behaviour of joints and cracks under single and multiple cycles of load. This provides an increased understanding of concrete slab on grade performance, enabling more effective design and monitoring procedures. Examination of the geometry of cracks and joints within concrete slabs on grade has demonstrated that the commonly assumed parallel formation is erroneous. Measurements using embedded strain gauges, coring and surface profile levelling have uncovered that {{a high percentage of}} joints will contain larger crack widths at the surface than at the base, caused by differential shrinkage. The opening itself is relatively linear; however, the top 50 mm of the slab is prone to a higher gradient of movement due to the increased drying effect towards the surface. A series of deflection tests using a Falling Weight Deflectometer and Prima dynamic plate enabled slab response under load to be evaluated. Four sites were examined in total and correlations found between: load transfer, load step, <b>edge</b> <b>cantilever</b> and crack geometry. This produced valuable information regarding the influence of load transfer and crack width on the overall slab behaviour. Foundation voiding and crack face free slip was also shown to influence deflection magnitude. A small-scale test facility was developed for the assessment of deterioration in various 'V' shaped and parallel crack widths under high cycle loading. The data demonstrated that joint/crack failure contains four distinct phases of deterioration, each of which is controlled by a different mechanism. 'V' shaped cracks produced a much greater load transfer than that of a parallel crack with the incorporation of A 142 mesh and steel fibres reducing differential displacement. Load magnitude and aggregate size were also shown to have significant effects. The value of reinforcement was found to assist with serviceability requirements, keeping displacement within acceptable levels and preventing the onset of serious degradation A finite element model was developed to enable the load transfer mechanism results from the laboratory test {{to be used in the}} assessment of full slab response. Simulations of field testing produced a series of lower bounds in respect to deflections and the associated response calculations. Theoretical behaviour of a typical slab was assessed with subbase support, joint stiffness, slab thickness and the incorporation of a subbase, found to be highly influential in reducing slab deflections.

The vibration parameters are calculated from finite element (using ANSYS) and experimental analysis which are used as inputs to the different fuzzy controllers. The different fuzzy controllers are designed by taking several types of membership functions to calculate the crack parameters. The calculated first three modal frequencies and mode shapes are used to generate the number of fuzzy rules with three output crack parameters. Finally, the proposed intelligent techniques are validated by comparing the results obtained from both FEA and experimental analysis.

The cracked beam is modeled as an assembly of two subbeams connected through a massless elastic rotational spring. In the study, the finite element of the beam is constructed by using the total Lagrangian Timoshenko beam element approximation. The nonlinear problem is solved by using incremental displacement-based finite element method in conjunction with Newton-Raphson iteration method. The convergence study is performed for various numbers of finite elements.

50|$|Mechanical {{detection}} in bio-MEMS {{is achieved}} through micro- and nano-scale cantilevers for stress sensing and mass sensing, or micro- and nano-scale plates or membranes. In stress sensing, the biochemical reaction is performed selectively {{on one side}} of the cantilever to cause a change in surface free energy. This results in bending of the cantilever that is measurable either optically (laser reflection into a quadposition detector) or electrically (piezo-resistor at the fixed <b>edge</b> of the <b>cantilever)</b> due to a change in surface stress. In mass sensing, the cantilever vibrates at its resonant frequency as measured electrically or optically. When a biochemical reaction takes place and is captured on the cantilever, the mass of the cantilever changes, as does the resonant frequency. Mass sensing is not as effective in fluids because the minimum detectable mass is much higher in damped mediums, something that is overcome with plates or membranes. The advantage of using cantilever sensors is that there is no need for an optically detectable label on the analyte or bioreceptors.|$|R
30|$|It may be {{necessary}} to arrange railway traffic on the outer <b>edge</b> of the <b>cantilever</b> deck of a box girder bridge for the sake of transportation planning. A continuous box girder bridge was designed in China to carry a single-track urban rail transit traffic on the cantilever deck of the bridge and three-lane highway traffic on {{the other part of the}} deck. In order to investigate the possible resonant responses of the coupled train–bridge system, the resonance condition of the cantilever deck under moving train loads is discussed analytically, and then numerical analyses of the vertical train–bridge dynamic interaction considering local vibration of the cantilever decks are carried out. The degrees of freedom of the bridge modeled by shell elements are so large that mode superposition method is used to reduce the computation efforts. It is found that the resonance speed of the cantilever deck predicted by the analytical method is 305  km/h, which agrees well with the numerical result. The numerically computed results also indicate that the serviceability of the bridge deck and the ride quality of the railway vehicles in the vertical direction are in good condition below the critical speed of 200  km/h.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetal coated micro-cantilevers {{are used}} as {{transducers}} of their electrochemical environment. Using the metallic layer of these cantilevers as a working electrode allows one to modify the electro-chemical state of the cantilever surface. Since the mechanical behavior of micrometer scale objects is significantly surface-driven, this environment modification induces bending of the cantilever. Using a full-field interferometric measurement set-up to monitor the objects then provides an optical phase map, which is found to originate from both electro-chemical and mechanical effects. The scaling of the electro-chemically-induced phase {{with respect to the}} surface charge density is modeled according to Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory, whereas the relationship between the mechanical effect and the surface charge density is analyzed. An identification technique is described to determine a modeling of the electro-elastic coupling and to identify the spatial charge density distribution from full-field phase measurements. Minimizing the least-squares gap between the measured phase and a statically admissible phase field, the mechanical effect is found to be charge-driven. The charge density field is also found to be singular on the <b>cantilever</b> <b>edge,</b> and the shear stress vs. charge density is found to be non-linear...|$|R

FE simulation has been carried out through ANSYS 14. 0, using Brick 8 -node solid 185 layered elements. Shell structures due to curvature effect show thermo-mechanical stress concentration effects not only at the edges but also at various other critical locations in its domain. Appropriate FE mesh size has been adopted to capture these stress concentration effects and has been established through validation with analytical results. Out-of-plane thermo-mechanical interlaminar stresses (σrr, τθr, τɸr) has been assumed to be responsible for damage initiation and hence have been analysed in details in order to reveal the critical ply-interface. In order to study dynamic stability of the shell structure under thermal environment, different lamination schemes have been adopted ([0 /θ] 4, θ 00, 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, and 900).

40|$|Anodic {{oxidation}} can be {{a catastrophic}} failure mechanism for MEMS devices that operate in high humidity environments. Shea and coworkers 1 have shown that positively charged polysilicon traces can fail through a progressive silicon oxidation reaction whose rate depends critically on the surface conductivity over the silicon nitride. We have found a related anodic oxidation-based failure mechanism: progressive delamination of Poly 0 electrodes from silicon nitride layers, which then mechanically interfere with device function well before the electrode is fully oxidized. To explain this effect, we propose that the silicon oxide which initially forms at the electrode edge has insufficient strength to hold the local Poly 0 / silicon nitride interface together. This low-density silicon oxide also creates a bilayer system, which curls {{the edge of the}} 300 nm thick Poly 0 electrode away from the nitride. As delamination progresses more nitride surface is exposed and more of the interface is then attacked. This process continues cyclically until the electrode edge pushes against other device components, catastrophically and irreversibly interfering with normal operation. Additionally, we observe that the delamination only starts at electrode <b>edges</b> directly under <b>cantilevers,</b> suggesting the oxidation rate also depends on the perpendicular electric field strength...|$|R

The numerical analysis of the problem comprise calculations of the global structural safety factor depending on the displacement of the chosen points in the lagging and conducted by means of the φ/c reduction procedure. The adopted graphical method of safety estimation is very conservative {{in the sense that it}} recognizes stability loss quite early, when one could further load the medium or weaken it by further strength reduction.

40|$|Cantilevered elastic {{sheets and}} rods {{immersed}} in a steady uniform flow are known to undergo instabilities {{that give rise to}} complex dynamics, including limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion. Recent work has examined their stability in an inverted configuration where the flow impinges on the free end of the cantilever with its clamped edge downstream: this is commonly referred to as an ‘inverted flag’. Theory has thus far accurately captured the stability of wide inverted flags only, i. e. where the dimension of the clamped <b>edge</b> exceeds the <b>cantilever</b> length; the latter is aligned in the flow direction. Here, we theoretically examine the stability of slender inverted flags and rods under steady uniform flow. In contrast to wide inverted flags, we show that slender inverted flags are never globally unstable. Instead, they exhibit bifurcation from a state that is globally stable to multiple equilibria of varying stability, as flow speed increases. This theory is compared with new and existing measurements on slender inverted flags and rods, where excellent agreement is observed. The findings of this study have significant implications to investigations of biological phenomena such as the motion of leaves and hairs, which can naturally exhibit a slender geometry with an inverted configuration...|$|R

The solutions are computed using the recently developed pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method. The actual triangular plate is first mapped onto a basic square plate, and the deflections and rotations of the plate are approximated by Ritz functions defined as products of two-dimensional polynomials in the basic square plate domain and a basic function. The basic function satisfies the geometric boundary conditions at the outset and is chosen as the boundary expression of the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>edge.</b> Stiffness and mass matrices are integrated numerically over {{the domain of the}} basic square plate using Gaussian quadrature.

Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer {{in order to achieve}} the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel gantry system. Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage systems, bowden style extrusion systems, build plate replacements, and thread ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the <b>cantilever</b> <b>edge</b> of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces.|$|R

For different scratching directions, the tip scratch face, the scratch <b>edge,</b> and the <b>cantilever</b> deformation are all different. The tip scratch face and the scratch edge affect the contact area, and the cantilever deformation affects the actual normal load acting on the sample surface in scratching test, which has been discussed in detail in our previous work [17]. The contact area and the actual normal force will directly affect the contact press, which is the important factor for forming the ripple structures [15]. For the three scratching angle, the contact area is the same due to the scan-scratch trace. So, the tip edge and faces have no effects on the different scratching angles. But, the actual normal load follows the order 0 °[*]<[*] 45 °[*]<[*] 90 °, which means that {{in order to get the}} same contact press, the normal load follows the order 0 °[*]>[*] 45 °[*]>[*] 90 °.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a fabrication process {{to grow a}} single carbon nanotube (CNT) based probe on an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever by direct current plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (DC-PECVD). Electron beam induced deposition (EBID) of carbon dots is utilized for catalyst patterning without using any e-beam resist. Its resist-free characteristic makes EBID {{a good choice for}} fabrication of patterns on the <b>edge</b> of the <b>cantilever.</b> CNT probes with < 10 nm tip radius and desired growth direction were produced by electric-field-guided DC-PECVD growth. This process is also capable of being integrated in batch fabrication. A tunable CNT growth technique was also developed to control the plasma-induced surface stresses on cantilever beams during PECVD process. By introducing hydrogen gas to the (acetylene + ammonia) feed gas during CNT growth and adjusting the ammonia to hydrogen flow ratio, the cantilever surface stress can be altered from compressive to tensile stress, and in doing so controlling the degree of cantilever bending. This technique enables us to solve the serious bending of low stiffness cantilevers after PECVD growth, which makes the CNT probe unsuitable for AFM measurements. High resolution imaging of thin film specimens and deep trenches were demonstrated using these CNT based probes in tapping-mode, as well as in contact-mode. The mechanical durability of CNT probes was examined by continuous scanning on silicon nitride surface. No degradation in imaging performance was observed after 8 hours of operation. Additionally, high coercivity iron-platinum coated CNT probes have been fabricated for magnetic force microscopy (MFM) applications. The FePt-coated CNT probe has much localized magnetic stray field due to the high-aspect-ratio geometry and small radius of the tip. The MFM imaging on magnetic recording media was performed, and images with 20 nm lateral resolution have been demonstrate...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to show that}} plate strips subjected to transverse line loads can be analysed by using the beam on elastic foundation (BEF) approach. It is shown that the elastic behaviour of both the centre line section of a semi infinite plate supported along two edges, and the free <b>edge</b> of a <b>cantilever</b> plate strip can be accurately predicted by calculations based on the two parameter BEF theory. The transverse bending stiffness of the plate strip forms the foundation. The foundation modulus is shown, mathematically and physically, to be the zero order term of the fourth order differential equation governing the behaviour of BEF, whereas the torsion rigidity of the plate acts like pre tension in the second order term. Direct equivalence is obtained for harmonic line loading by comparing the differential equations of Levy's method (a simply supported plate) with the BEF method. By equating the second and zero order terms of the semi infinite BEF model for each harmonic component, two parameters are obtained for a simply supported plate of width B: the characteristic length, 1 / λ, and the normalized sum, n, being the effect of axial loading and stiffening resulting from the torsion stiffness, nlin. This procedure gives the following result for the first mode when a uniaxial stress field was assumed (ν = 0) : 1 /λ = √ 2 B/π and nlin = 1. For constant line loading, which is the superimposition of harmonic components, slightly differing foundation parameters are obtained when the maximum deflection and bending moment values of the theoretical plate, with v = 0, and BEF analysis solutions are equated: 1 /λ= 1. 47 B/π and nlin. = 0. 59 for a simply supported plate; and 1 /λ = 0. 99 B/π and nlin = 0. 25 for a fixed plate. The BEF parameters of the plate strip with a free edge are determined based solely on finite element analysis (FEA) results: 1 /λ = 1. 29 B/π and nlin. = 0. 65, where B is the double width of the cantilever plate strip. The stress biaxial, v > 0, is shown not to affect the values of the BEF parameters significantly the result of the geometric nonlinearity caused by in plane, axial and biaxial loading is studied theoretically by comparing the differential equations of Levy's method with the BEF approach. The BEF model is generalised {{to take into account the}} elastic rotation stiffness of the longitudinal edges. Finally, formulae are presented that take into account the effect of Poisson's ratio, and geometric non linearity, on bending behaviour resulting from axial and transverse inplane loading. It is also shown that the BEF parameters of the semi infinite model are valid for linear elastic analysis of a plate strip of finite length. The BEF model was verified by applying it to the analysis of bending stresses caused by misalignments in a laboratory test panel. In summary, it can be concluded that the advantages of the BEF theory are that it is a simple tool, and that it is accurate enough for specific stress analysis of semi infinite and finite plate bending problems...|$|R
