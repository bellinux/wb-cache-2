5|$|Following Genesis, A.J. Styles and Tomko {{went on to}} join Kurt and Karen Angle to form The Angle Alliance. Due to Angle's {{attack on}} Nash at Genesis, Nash and Scott Hall went on to request a Six Man Tag Team match for TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December 2. Nash and Hall were granted their request, and Samoa Joe later was {{revealed}} as their mystery partner for the encounter. Hall ended up no-showing the event, {{and as a result}} Eric Young <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> place in the bout, which was won by Joe, Nash, and Young.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to Kansas City's starting rotation in 2006 {{when he was}} named the fourth starter during Spring training. However, he was moved up to the third spot before the season began when Runelvys Hernández was demoted to the fifth spot. Affeldt struggled as a starter, going 25 with a 7.80 ERA in nine starts. His final major league start came on May 27 against the New York Yankees. He gave up ten runs on eleven hits in a 154 loss. After the start, {{he was sent to}} the bullpen, and Bobby Keppel <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> place in the starting rotation. Affeldt improved in the bullpen, posting a 2.91 ERA there through July 31.|$|E

5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> {{work with a}} feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E

5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see what they could do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to the United States, testing of the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter was underway. He had made the first flight of the XP-80A in January, and the testing program continued through 1944 and into 1945. In October 1944, Milo Burcham was killed in the crash of a production P-80, and Tony LeVier <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> office as chief engineering test pilot in January 1945.|$|E
25|$|Macha was {{replaced}} by bench coach and former major league catcher Bob Geren. Following the 2006 season, the A's also lost ace Barry Zito to the Giants due to free agency.

The second full-length album, Rise to Dominate, was recorded in April 2007 at Empire Studio, mixed and mastered by Dan Swanö at Unisound Studios and released in September 2007. Fjellström joined Dark Funeral on a tour in October 2007, but rejoined Aeon in February 2008.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, the Wednesday {{after he}} {{returned}} to the Santa Rosa Beach house, he went up to Vortex Spring again. In the middle of the day, he did one dive. Other divers saw him looking closely at the area around the cave entrance, as if, it was later reported, he was planning something. After resurfacing he <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> tanks at the dive shop, a transaction recorded on security cameras (it is not known what he filled those tanks with). He spent {{much of the rest of}} the afternoon by himself alongside the spring, witnesses said, testing equipment and making notes in his dive log.|$|E

25|$|On September 18, 1991, the Latvian {{government}} had also petitioned the U.S government {{to promote the}} Legation to the highest rank of Embassy and to accept Dinbergs as Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador. The U.S. acceded to the request, and so on March 11, 1992, Anatols Dinbergs submitted his credentials of accreditation to U.S. president George H. Bush. Bush expressed his particular happiness to see Dinbergs in this post, who {{for so long and}} so ably <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> duties, and that it was gratifying to work with such an eminent diplomat. Latvian diplomatic representation in U.S. during 1922-1948 had been vested in envoys, since the Latvian government only created the post of ambassador in 1991, Dinbergs thus became Latvia's first ever ambassador to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the {{continuously}} growing {{rift between}} Salazar {{and the other}} two founding members caused Love to leave Fenix TX shortly after the release of the album. Dennis Hill of the Southern Californian pop punk band Lefty temporarily <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> place, while a permanent replacement was found in Pivit's Chris Lewis (unrelated to bassist Adam Lewis), during a tour with P.O.D. in October 2001. However, he never legally became a member, which ultimately allowed DeLaPaz and Adam Lewis to overrule Salazar in a decision to break up the band. This occurred {{in the middle of the}} writing process for what would have become Fenix TX's third album. On September 19, 2002, the disbandment of Fenix TX was officially announced, despite Salazar's wishes to continue the band.|$|E
25|$|Gwynn {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California, to Charles and Vendella Gwynn. He was nine when his parents decided they would move from their {{apartment}} and buy a house in Long Beach, a location they chose because of their schools, parks, and youth sports options throughout the year. He grew up with older brother Charles Jr., who played college baseball and became a teacher, and younger brother Chris, who also became an MLB player. Gwynn's parents were civil servants who were tag-team parents. Gwynn's father worked at a warehouse from 7:30 A.M. until 5:00 P.M., and he also coached Pop Warner football and Little League Baseball; his mother worked {{at the post office}} from 5:30 P.M. until 3:00 A.M. His mother and father instilled in him the value of being prepared. He <b>filled</b> <b>his</b> time playing mostly basketball, which was his favorite sport.|$|E
