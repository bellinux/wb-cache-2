40|$|On {{the example}} of two {{developed}} democratic states, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, gun culture phenomenon is being studied which means the relationship of society and state towards small firearms, expectations and fears of guns, meaning {{of the right to}} obtain, possess and bear guns in a modern democratic society, power and safety aspects of gun culture in both countries. A high explanatory power on gun culture is encompassed in a quantitative indicator of the ratio of injury numbers caused by firearms per capita to the total number of firearms per capita. Britain radically restricted the right to gun with the aim to increase safety, however with not fully convincing results. Switzerland by contrast made this right a key element of its defense strategy, but facilitation effect of <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> has its negative impacts too. From the qualitative perspective, civilians' right to guns can be seen as indicator of state's trust in its citizens, an indicator of distribution of power between citizens and the state. The unanswered question is how to determine an optimal level of gun regulation while preserving one of the key rights of a free individual, the right to defend his/her legitimate interests...|$|E

40|$|The DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) {{program has}} {{acquired}} an incredibly large quantity of data over its period of operation, {{all of which}} must be reviewed in some manner {{in order to ensure}} that the data is of “known and reasonable” quality (<b>ARM</b> Science Plan). <b>To</b> accomplish this, Mission Research Corporation (MRC) coordinates with the ARM Data Quality Office to develop software tools that quality-check data products in a timely and continuous fashion. These tools work with the Data Quality Health and Status (DQ HandS) Explorer (Peppler et al. 2004) by analyzing ARM data streams, providing assessments of data quality in the form of color-coded tables, and generating custom visualizations. Tools for interactively visualizing ARM data sets have also been developed by us for inspecting each of the 600 + data streams that pass through the ARM Data Management Facility (DMF) each day. NCVweb is a Web based application developed for this task, and is designed <b>to</b> allow <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ARM</b> data at the DMF and at the ARM archive. Here we will review some of NCVweb’s key features as well as introduce new tools for viewing the quality of Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) data, its corresponding Value Added Products (VAPs) and Quality Measurement Experiments (QMEs) ...|$|R
30|$|Variables {{encapsulating}} {{the openness}} of the economy are often included in the empirical estimations (inter alia: Nikolaidou 2008; Dunne et al. 2003). The sum of exports and imports {{of goods and services}} measured as a share of GDP is the variable most preferred to quantify openness. The effect of openness on military spending is ambiguous. For example, Rosh (1988) postulates that countries highly integrated in the global economy probably find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>arms</b> markets and finance for arms procurement. On the other hand, however, {{it has been shown that}} international trade has a peace promoting influence both between belligerent countries as well as within countries (Seitz et al. 2015; Huang and Throsby 2011; Kollias and Paleologou 2017). The openness of the economy and increased access and participation of countries in international trade is a factor that reduces the probability of conflict (Huang and Throsby 2011) whereas the benefits from increased peacefulness also take the form of reductions in defence spending with the concomitant welfare effects (Seitz et al. 2015).|$|R
