50|$|After the {{rotation}} is complete, a retractor pushes the protruding bars back into place. A set of <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> advances the key wheels by one position, and a locking arm latches into the drum {{to prevent a}} second encoding until the indicator disk is adjusted for the next letter.|$|R
5000|$|... "The engine exerts {{its power}} {{with an air}} so modest as to be deceptive" [...] {{declared}} Autocar in its report timed to match {{the release of the}} Pilot [...] Gear changing, said Autocar, is easy, it takes carelessness to make any noise. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> are [...] "unexpectedly quiet".|$|R
5000|$|Rowing is the {{technique}} of downshifting more than one gear along with the heel-and-toe technique to provide engine braking and smoother deceleration/braking while in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> [...] This provides for maximum braking when going from a top gear to a much lower gear, and optimal engine RPM for exiting the corner.|$|R
50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> rolls without {{slipping}} on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an idler gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler gear.|$|E
5000|$|Two manual transmissions, a three-speed and three-speed with {{overdrive}} were available, {{as well as}} three-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission. Starting in 1958, Cruise-O-Matic was added, {{which provided}} a second [...] "drive" [...] range ("D2"), allowing for an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> start.|$|E
50|$|In a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only {{on the number of}} teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. However, the addition of each <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|E
30|$|Linear motor {{is a kind}} of {{electrical}} equipment which can directly convert the electrical energy to linear movement. Compared with traditional rotating machine, the drive system of linear motor works without the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gearing,</b> which simplifies the driver system, and makes its linear velocity unlimited and moving process without mechanical touch. In addition, the noise level of linear motor is very low. For all these characteristics, linear motor is widely applied to high-speed ground transportation [1, 2, 3, 4].|$|R
5000|$|The {{rear axle}} of the TT had a worm drive and crown wheel, unlike the Model T's crown wheel and pinion. The worm was {{located at the}} end of the drive shaft and above the crown wheel. The {{wheelbase}} of the Model TT was 125 in, compared to 100 in for the Model T. It was often equipped with an accessory gearbox, such as the Ruxtell or Jumbo gearboxes, which allowed the truck to have <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> between low and high, useful for hill climbing.|$|R
50|$|Under test by The Times its {{correspondent}} {{wrote that}} the 1577 cc car's great charm lay in its quietness at all times, furthermore the engine was silky and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> produced no hum. Pick-up was good {{in view of the}} size of the engine and the weight of the car. The suspension permitted wheel bounce. The clutch pedal was too close to the steering column. Twelve months later a subsequent road test reported that fresh modifications allowed the engine a more spontaneous response. Wheel bounce remained a problem.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> {{which does}} not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an [...] gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be {{referred}} to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears.|$|E
50|$|Various {{suspension}} modifications {{had been}} carried out. Servo-assisted 12 in Girling disc brakes were now installed on the front wheels and Burman recirculating ball power steering was standardised with a turning circle reduced by 4'6". A BorgWarner type DG automatic gearbox was fitted which incorporated a lever on the facia to hold <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> at 35, 45, 55, and 65 m.p.h.|$|E

50|$|Train of ten {{cascading}} gears at {{front of}} the engine operate the camshafts, magnetos, oil and water pumps. The crankshaft gear drives the two magneto gears at crank speed. The two to one speed reduction to the camshafts {{takes place at the}} first stage of the gear train; all the remaining gears between the first <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> and the gears at the camshafts are idlers.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine block}} is {{constructed}} of aluminum with fiber-reinforced metal sleeve. A timing chain drives an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear,</b> which drives the cams. The pistons are forged aluminum. The intake plenum was designed with minimal volume for fast engine response, and a 14 lb flywheel was fitted until 2004. A high-flow catalyst is supplied {{along with an}} exhaust air-injection system, which greatly decrease catalyst light-off time and cold emissions.|$|E
50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|E
50|$|The Times {{reported}} the 90 was fast, it could reach 80 mph, (it was independently timed at 76.6 mph), it was well-sprung {{and there was}} no wind-roar when cruising at 60 mph to 70 mph. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> were remarkably quiet. The steering column gear lever was light to operate but it required several tries to engage reverse. The springing was not up to the standard provided by Independent front suspension. The test sports saloon leaked into the interior in several places. The tester liked the variable driving position, the seat height can also be adjusted. This is one of the prettiest cars made today anywhere.|$|R
25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional {{to the difference between}} the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears)</b> to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinders}} of the adhesion and cogwheel drives {{have the}} same diameters (Ø 560 mm). The difference in volume (after expulsion from the adhesion system, the steam doubles its volume) is compensated for because the cogwheel drive turns twice as fast. The driving cogwheel is housed in a special frame, that lies above {{the second and third}} axle. The higher cogwheel drive and the lower cogwheel are coupled via an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> with a transmission ratio of 1:2.43.|$|E
50|$|Motors of {{this type}} {{can also be found}} on {{overhead}} cranes and hoists. The micro speed unit combines two motors and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> reducer. These are used for applications where extreme mechanical positioning accuracy and high cycling capability are needed. The micro speed unit combines a “main” conical rotor brake motor for rapid speed and a “micro” conical rotor brake motor for slow or positioning speed. The intermediate gearbox allows a range of ratios, and motors of different speeds can be combined to produce high ratios between high and low speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the heel-toe-double-clutch is to {{downshift}} more than one gear to use engine braking in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear.</b> This provides maximum braking and optimal engine speed for exiting the corner while causing the least wear of the entire drive train. While this is not double clutching in the conventional sense, the term is used to describe this technique since the clutch pedal is pressed more than once. Note that racers will sometimes skip gears during downshifts depending on the vehicle speed {{as there is no}} need to shift through every gear when significant speed has been lost.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{problem of}} {{changing}} from first to second gear is that two bands must actuate in synchronism: the planet {{support of the}} second gearset must release {{at the same time}} as the sun band is actuated. As a result, this is a gear change that tends to be rougher than the others, where just one band is released or actuated. This also means more wear in auto box parts. This is solved by the use of one-way overrun clutches which allow one or more components to [...] "free wheel" [...] when the transmission shifts into a higher gear. GM's Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 and 400 transmissions utilized overrun clutches in both the low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears,</b> allowing for fully progressive shifting with no [...] "overlap".|$|R
50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These <b>intermediate</b> <b>gears</b> allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle and gear train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R

5000|$|The Wilson gearbox {{relied on}} a number of {{epicyclic}} gears, coupled in an ingenious manner that was also Wilson's invention. A separate epicyclic was required for each <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear,</b> with a cone clutch for the straight-through top gear and a further epicyclic for reverse. Four gears were provided, {{at a time when many}} cars (especially American ones) usually only had a three speed gearbox. This was owing to the sporting, or indeed racing, market for the Wilson gearbox, so that the ratios could be more closely spaced. Although this same arrangement of epicyclics would become the precursor for the post-war automatic transmission, the automatic transmission's use of a torque converter, together with the broad power band and excess power of US V8 engines, meant that wider-spaced, thus fewer, ratios were acceptable. Unlike the [...] "crash" [...] gearboxes of the first half of the 20th century, the gearwheels in a preselector box are permanently in mesh in an epicyclic layout.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear</b> {{which does}} not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be {{referred}} to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear [...] "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear [...] "C" [...] will be spinning the same direction as [...] "A". A typical transmission is designed with [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the opposite direction, which drives the vehicle forward. A reverse idler gear setup is actually typically an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "C" [...] gear, which are not in contact with each other until a [...] "B" [...] gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car forwards when the output is spinning in the opposite direction from the input shaft, when added to the [...] "B" [...] idler gear, it forces the [...] "C" [...] gear to spin {{in the same direction as}} the [...] "A" [...] gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.|$|E

After explaining chain gear basics the polygon effect and chain lengthening are investigated. The polygon effect could be measured by a heliostat with chain rim gear and the chain lengthening with an accordant test set up. Two gear stages are scope of this work: a rim gear and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>gear.</b> Dimensioning, pretensioning and designing for both stages are explained...|$|E
