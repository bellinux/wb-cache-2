The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E

5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was {{a decline in the}} number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.|$|E
