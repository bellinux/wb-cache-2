25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, <b>I</b> <b>invite</b> you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{took to the}} Senate floor {{after the}} election, giving a speech well {{received}} in the North, [...] "I will not give up this government... No; I intend to stand by it... and <b>I</b> <b>invite</b> every man who is a patriot to... rally around the altar of our common country... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved." [...] As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon {{be the president of}} the Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.|$|E

Unlike the previous films, J. Jonah Jameson does not appear. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films. At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle.

5000|$|Amharic is a pro-drop language: neutral {{sentences}} {{in which no}} element is emphasized normally omit independent pronouns: [...] hes Ethiopian, [...] <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> her. The Amharic words that translate he, I, and her do not appear in these sentences as independent words. However, in such cases, the person, number, and (second- or third-person singular) gender of the subject and object are marked on the verb. When the subject or object in such sentences is emphasized, an independent pronoun is used: [...] hes Ethiopian, [...] <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> her, [...] <b>I</b> <b>invited</b> her.|$|R

2500|$|Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 {{national}} TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). [...] In 2002, Luciano Violante, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} Left, {{said in a speech}} in Parliament: [...] "Honourable Anedda, <b>I</b> <b>invite</b> you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed— that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it." [...] The authors of the book Inciucio cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.|$|E

[...] Colbert makes {{no secret of}} his spoofing O'Reilly: upon hearing the news that O'Reilly approved of The Colbert Report, he declared on-air that [...] "I like you too.
