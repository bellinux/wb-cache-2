While {{on the label}} Cook took his 1999 project, In The Middle of <b>it</b> <b>All,</b> <b>up</b> the charts garnering several #1 singles, a Dove Award nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time. He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a children's television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, Crabbottom USA, taped at local television station, WHTV TV-39, a Nashville Tennessee based station.|$|E

25|$|The semi-final match {{presented}} {{the first major}} challenge in the short reign of the then reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions, Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero as they faced former champions Negro Casas and the returning Hijo del Santo, the clear crowd favorites. The crowd favorites got the fans on their feet during the first fall, especially when Hijo del Santo forced Rey Bucanero to submit to his trademark submission hold called La de a Caballo (Camel clutch). Moments later Último Guerrero was unable {{to return to the}} ring before the referee counted to twenty, costing his team the first fall. The tag team champions fought their way back in control of the ring and won the second fall to tie <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up.</b> The third fall saw Casas and Hijo del Santo almost win the championship on several occasions, but in the end Bucanero pinned Negro Casas while Guerrero pinned El Hijo del Santo to retain their titles. The emotions behind the main event was evident from before the bell even rang, with both veteran competitors attacking each. The match was more of a brutal fight than a wrestling exhibition as the two fought {{both inside and outside the}} ring. The match was relatively short, three falls in the span of just eight minutes and twenty six seconds, but it was action filled from start to finish. In the end Aguayo defeated his longtime enemy to take the match. Following the match Cien Caras had all his hair shaved off while sitting in the middle of the ring, honoring the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 1998 film, {{the show}} began to receive {{increasingly}} critical reviews. Some longtime fans became alienated during the show's sixth season, {{due to the}} different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles.

Cambone's notes quoted Rumsfeld as saying, [...] "Need to move swiftly – Near term target needs – go massive – sweep <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up.</b> Things related and not." [...] In a meeting at Camp David on September 15 the Bush administration rejected the idea of attacking Iraq in response to 9/11.

500|$|Despite their {{commercial}} popularity, {{the group}} were dissatisfied creatively; lead vocalist Bono {{believed they were}} musically unprepared for their success, while drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "We were the biggest, but we weren't the best." [...] By the band's 1989 Lovetown Tour, they had become bored with playing their greatest hits. U2 believe that audiences misunderstood the group's collaboration with blues musician B.B. King on Rattle and Hum and the Lovetown Tour, and they described it as [...] "an excursion down a dead-end street". Bono said that, in retrospect, listening to black music enabled the group to create a work such as Achtung Baby, while their experiences with folk music helped him to develop as a lyricist. Towards {{the end of the}} Lovetown Tour, Bono announced on-stage that it was [...] "the end of something for U2", and that [...] "we have to go away and... dream <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> again". Following the tour, the group began, what was at the time, their longest break from public performances and album releases.|$|E

Coulter and Babbington married at a secret {{location}} in Canungra, Queensland on 7 September 2007. Coulter took her husband's last name and became Ricki-Lee Babbington. The couple had their honeymoon in the Maldives for five weeks. The following year, on 18 October 2008, Coulter's publicist issued a statement that they had separated due to [...] "distance and time apart". In an interview with Herald Suns Jonathan Moran, {{three years after the}} marriage ended, Coulter revealed that she had experienced depression during her relationship with Babbington. [...] "I was living my dream but behind closed doors my personal life was a mess. [...] I felt alone, I bottled <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and it made things worse.

500|$|Singer-songwriter David Gray {{commented that}} the great {{achievement}} of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found {{a way out of}} the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: [...] "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up,</b> they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal." ...|$|E
500|$|U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the {{supporting}} Joshua Tree Tour {{brought them to}} a new level of commercial and critical success, particularly in the United States. Like their previous tours, the Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and they used this outlet for addressing political and social concerns. As a result, the band earned a reputation for being earnest and serious, an image that became a target for derision after their much-maligned 1988 motion picture and companion album Rattle and Hum, which documented their exploration of American roots music. The project was criticised as being [...] "pretentious", and [...] "misguided and bombastic", and U2 were accused of being grandiose and self-righteous. Their 1989 Lovetown Tour did not visit the United States, {{and at the end of}} the tour, lead vocalist Bono announced on-stage that it was [...] "the end of something for U2" [...] and that [...] "we have to go away and ... just dream <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> again", foreshadowing changes for the group.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{penchant for}} {{addressing}} {{political and social}} issues, {{as well as their}} staid depiction in Corbijn's black-and-white sleeve photographs, contributed to the group's earnest and serious image as [...] "stone-faced pilgrim". This image became a target for derision after the band's critically maligned Rattle and Hum project in 1988. Various critics called them [...] "po-faced", [...] "pompous bores", and [...] "humourless". The group's continued exploration of American music for the project was labelled [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "misguided and bombastic". After Bono told fans on the 1989 Lovetown Tour that U2 would [...] "dream <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> again", the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s. They incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the [...] "rock star" [...] identity they struggled with in the 1980s. Bono referred to their 1991 album Achtung Baby as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree". Author Bill Flanagan summarised the impact of The Joshua Tree on the group's career in his liner notes for the album's 20th anniversary release: [...] "The Joshua Tree made U2 into international rock stars and established both a standard they would always have to live up to and an image they would forever try to live down." ...|$|E

500|$|The Tenjho Tenge manga is {{described}} by Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD as an [...] "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times". Its creator, Oh! great, is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence. Oh! great uses sex as {{an important aspect of}} the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively. He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength. This conscious deliberation of subjective reasoning and objective truth between characters is the most imperative aspect of story and is considered to be rare in manga. Dani Moure of AnimeOnDVD said readers may find that Oh! great's narrative is occasionally hard to follow and at times the plot moves slowly. Oh! great is known for his characters to have unrealistic body proportions, and Tenjho Tenge is no different. The majority of the female characters have [...] "...ultra large breasts..." [...] and the males characters are extraordinarily muscular, but this facilitates the characters personalities to come through in their distinctive features. Overall, the Tenjho Tenge manga is well received having sold over 10.7 million copies, and its volumes regularly being in the top twenty best-selling manga for Japanese Tohan charts and North American Diamond Comic Distributors charts.|$|E
500|$|In October 1988, {{the group}} {{released}} Rattle and Hum, a double album and theatrically released documentary film that captured the band's experiences with American roots {{music on the}} Joshua Tree Tour. The record featured nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances, including recordings at Sun Studios in Memphis and performances with Dylan and B. B. King. Intended {{as a tribute to}} American music, the project received mixed reviews from both film and music critics; one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album's [...] "excitement", another described it as [...] "misguided and bombastic". The film's director, Phil Joanou, described it as [...] "an overly pretentious look at U2". Despite the criticism, the album sold 14million copies and reached number one worldwide. Lead single [...] "Desire" [...] became the band's first UK number-one song while reaching number three in the US. Most of the album's new material was played on 1989–1990's Lovetown Tour, which only visited Australasia, Japan, and Europe, so as to avoid the critical backlash the group faced in the US. In addition, they had grown dissatisfied with their live performances; Mullen recalled, [...] "We were the biggest, but we weren't the best". With a sense of musical stagnation, Bono said to fans on one of the last dates of the tour that it was [...] "the end of something for U2" [...] and that they had to [...] "go away and... just dream <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> again".|$|E
