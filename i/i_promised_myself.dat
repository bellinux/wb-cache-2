25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> when I finished The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was down}} in the {{bottomless}} pit of humiliation. <b>I</b> had <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> an easy and zenith-scouring triumph, {{and this was the}} outcome! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bravo, bravo!" [...] exclaimed I, with irrepressible enthusiasm; [...] "this {{shows the}} liberality of the age; this proves, if {{anything}} can, that all musty prejudices {{are in a}} fair way to be obliterated. And how will Christian rejoice to hear of this happy transformation of his old antagonist! <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> great pleasure in informing him of it when we reach the Celestial City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah your journalist, your journalist, mademoiselle!" [...] said Maxime de Cliche. [...] "I'm {{very sorry}} {{to have to say}} {{anything}} in regard to any friend of yours that can give you so little pleasure; but <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> the satisfaction of administering him with these hands a dressing he won't forget, if I may trouble you so far as to ask you to let him know it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps they beant at home,' sighed the driver. 'And <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> {{a bit of}} supper in Pa'son Swancourt's kitchen. Sich lovely mate-pize and figged keakes, and cider, {{and drops}} o' cordial that they do keep here!' ...|$|E
60|$|Save to {{keep the}} canoe in mid-stream, Kenton {{made no effort to}} direct her movements, and we floated down the river in silence, keeping sharp watch on either bank while <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> never again to be guilty of giving way to fear.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MISS FERRIER,--They say Walter is gone. You, {{who know}} how I have {{neglected}} him, will conceive my remorse. I had another letter written; when I heard he was worse, <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> to wake up for the last time. Alas, too late! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} of it," [...] he answered. [...] "The worst {{of it is that}} nothing in the world would induce me to forego the {{pleasure}} <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself,</b> before very long, too, of giving to the whole world the story of your infamy. I am not tractable to-night. You had better go away, both of you. I am more likely to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Accepting the tract offered him, the {{cosmopolitan}} {{glanced over}} it, and, seeming {{to see just}} what it was, closed it, {{put it in his}} pocket, eyed the man a moment, then, leaning over and presenting him with a shilling, said to him, in tones kind and considerate: [...] "I am sorry, my friend, that I happen to be engaged just now; but, having purchased your work, <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> much satisfaction in its perusal at my earliest leisure." ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{the middle}} of the day prove warm and pleasant, <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> to take a walk. [...] . I have taken one walk with Mr. Farley; and I could not have {{believed}} that there was such seclusion at so short a distance from a great city. Many spots seem hardly to have been visited for ages,--not since John Eliot preached to the Indians here. If we were to travel a thousand miles, we could not escape the world more completely than we can here.|$|R
60|$|Sorely did I blame Jacob {{for having}} forced us {{into such a}} {{position}} of danger, when there was little hope any good could be effected by our coming, and more than once <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that, if by any fortunate chance I succeeded in arriving at Cherry Valley again, no one could tempt me to leave it.|$|E
6000|$|A stone whizzed by my head. I {{flattened}} {{myself out}} in the dust like a postage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little he would probably hear another noise. In my heart, now, I execrated secret expeditions. <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that this should be my last, though the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins. Then {{one of the men}} said: ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot express {{how much}} I was {{delighted with the}} sallies of my new acquaintance. He {{told me that he}} often frequented the castle, and would be glad to know more of me; and <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> many a {{pleasant}} afternoon with him, when I should read him my poem, as it proceeded, and benefit by his remarks; for it was evident he had the true poetical feeling.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> not to {{look out}} in the {{direction}} where the unhappy captives were to be seen; {{but it was as}} if their helplessness fascinated me {{to such a degree that}} I could not keep my eyes from them.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Hark ye!' cried Jonas, {{stamping}} {{his foot}} upon the ground. 'You made me bear your pretty humours once, and ecod I'll make you bear mine now. <b>I</b> always <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> would. I married you that I might. I'll know who's master, and who's slave!' ...|$|R
60|$|But, on {{the other}} hand, as we did not resolve to fall upon the European traders, who were {{generally}} ships of force and well manned, and where blows must be looked for; so I had another prospect, which <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> would yield equal profit, or perhaps greater, {{without any of the}} hazard and difficulty of the former; and this was the Gulf of Mocha, or the Red Sea.|$|E
60|$|To England, therefore, I was bound, {{and it was}} {{understood}} that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> from my detested toils--one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.|$|E
60|$|A holyday {{afternoon}} presented, when I {{could be}} {{absent from the}} school from noon until evening. A wagon was going from the village to the fair. I could not resist the temptation, nor the eloquence of Tom Dribble, who was a truant to the very heart's core. We hired seats, and set off full of boyish expectation. <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that I would but take a peep at the land of promise, and hasten back again before my absence should be noticed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, for that," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "I count {{it not a}} fly; for <b>I</b> had <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> a good hour ago that I should go with thee, since the life {{seems to be a}} goodly and proper one. Yet I would fain have had the feather-bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. FURSTENWALDE, 22d AUGUST. [...] "Yesterday I {{wrote to}} you to come; but to-day I forbid it. Daun is at Kotbus; he is marching on Luben and Berlin [nothing like so rash!].--Fly these unhappy Countries!--This news obliges me again to attack the Russians between here and Frankfurt. You may imagine {{if this is a}} desperate resolution. It is the sole hope that remains to me, of not being cut off from Berlin on the one side or the other. I will give the {{discouraged}} troops some brandy"--alas!--"but <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> nothing of success. My one consolation is, that I shall die sword in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shall never}} know it! He thinks me cold and capricious! Let him! It is my purpose {{to make him}} suffer, and he shall suffer! In that I will be true to my oath; I will make of this {{weakness}} a scourge! No one will know what it costs me! No one will know how sweet to me are the words which I train my lips to answer with scorn! Never a tender look or word shall he gain from me; yet this much can <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself.</b> No one else shall ever be dear to me! No other lover will I have save his memory! He thinks that I dislike him! He shall think so to the end! He shall never know--never! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure," [...] I replied; and I felt {{a thrill}} of artist-delight {{at the idea}} of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only {{ornament}} was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another day.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a young gentleman {{after my}} own heart," [...] Prince Charles said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> on {{shipboard}} {{that we should}} be great friends; but I have been so busy since I landed, and you have been so occupied in my service, that I have seen but little of you. On your return I hope that I shall be able to have you near my person. I am half jealous of you, for while you are younger than I am you have seen good service and taken part in great battles, but hitherto I have led a life almost of idleness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are a {{good boy}} at bottom, Felix, and mean well, and I am only sorry {{not to be able}} to hinder you from {{throwing}} yourself away for life by trying to do what is morally impossible, in a foolish spirit of independence. Do not interrupt. I warn you that I am not to be appealed to for getting you out of the difficulties you are plunging into; but of course your brother and sister will be mine as before; and as <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> to do the same by your mother as by your father--my near cousins both--here is to cover necessary expenses.' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, seignior, says he, we {{will not}} be in haste, or view it by halves; for, if wild and uncouth places be a {{diversion}} to you, <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> your curiosity shall be fully gratified; but as to extraordinary things, rarities in nature, and surprising incidents, which foreigners expect, I cannot say much to those. However, what think you, seignior, says he, if we should take a tour a little way into the entrance of the hills which I showed you the other day, and look upon the gate of this gulf? Perhaps your curiosity may be satisfied with the first day's prospect, which I assure you will be none of the most pleasant, and you may find yourself sick of the enterprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "The crudeness of your ferocity is {{positively}} gross, Martin," [...] Mr. Jones said disdainfully. [...] "You don't even understand my purpose. I mean {{to have some}} sport out of him. Just try to imagine {{the atmosphere of the}} game--the fellow handling the cards--the agonizing mockery of it! Oh, I shall appreciate this greatly. Yes, let him lose his money instead of being forced to hand it over. You, of course, would shoot him at once, but I shall enjoy the refinement and the jest of it. He's a man of the best society. I've been hounded out of my sphere by people very much like that fellow. How enraged and humiliated he will be! <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> some exquisite moments while watching his play." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> {{to report}} <b>myself</b> {{to you from}} {{this side of the}} Atlantic, and as I have some leisure this morning, I am going to lighten my {{conscience}} by keeping my word.|$|R
60|$|After {{our early}} dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing {{to finish off}} the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime {{compassion}} for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds. <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> that I would do something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village.|$|E
6000|$|When we {{got home}} I sent the horse away {{with one of my}} grooms to a farmer's house, to break him {{thoroughly}} in, and told Bryan, who was all anxiety to see his little horse, that he would arrive by his birthday, when he should hunt him along with my hounds; and <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> no small pleasure in presenting the dear fellow to the field that day: which I hoped to see him lead some time or other in place of his fond father. Ah me! never was that gallant boy to ride a fox-chase, or to take the place amongst the gentry of his country which his birth and genius had pointed out for him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed I do, Count Bernard. I {{know you}} meant kindly by me, and that I {{ought to have}} thanked you, and not been angry, when you reproved me. Wait one moment, Sir Count; {{there is one thing}} that <b>I</b> <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> to say if ever I came safe to my own dear home. Walter--Maurice--Jeannot--all you of my household, and of Sir Eric's--I know, before I went away, I was often no good Lord to you; I was passionate, and proud, and overbearing; but God has punished me for it, when I was far away among my enemies, and sick and lonely. I am very sorry for it, and I hope you will pardon me; for I will strive, and I hope God will help me, never to be proud and passionate again." ...|$|E
60|$|MAN. For the desires, pleasures, and {{gains of}} this world; in the {{enjoyment}} of which <b>I</b> did then <b>promise</b> <b>myself</b> much delight; but now {{every one of those}} things also bite me, and gnaw me, like a burning worm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not speak}} idly, my dear Roderick. I weighed the matter before <b>I</b> spoke, and <b>promised</b> <b>myself</b> {{to let you know}} {{immediately}} afterwards. It seemed to me that Miss Light had better know that your affections are pledged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{got back}} from the Continent last night," [...] he began. [...] "And I come here, as <b>I</b> <b>promised,</b> to report <b>myself</b> on my return. How does your ladyship do? How is Miss Roseberry?" ...|$|R
