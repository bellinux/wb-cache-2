5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to, but Đính dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero {{should be able to}} identify the national enemy, and asked him to call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E
25|$|Jesus preached mainly {{about the}} Kingdom of God. Scholars are divided over whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to an {{imminent}} apocalyptic event or {{the transformation of}} everyday life.|$|E
25|$|In a speech, Bush {{said his}} brother, former President George W. Bush, was his main adviser on policy with the Middle East. Bush later {{clarified}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to policy on Israel, {{rather than on}} the Middle East as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Although Boas did {{not name}} the spies in question, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> {{to a group}} led by Sylvanus G.

While conducting research in Mexico, Morley and his colleagues looked for evidence of German submarine bases, and collected intelligence on Mexican political figures and German immigrants in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Agrava Fact-Finding Board convened on November 3, 1983. Before {{it could}} start its work President Marcos accused the Communists {{of the killing}} of Senator Aquino: The {{decision}} to eliminate the former Senator, Marcos claimed, was made {{by none other than}} the general-secretary of the Philippine Communist Party, Rodolfo Salas. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to his earlier claim that Aquino had befriended and subsequently betrayed his Communist comrades.|$|E
25|$|At Japan Expo 2017, {{producer}} Masao Maruyama of Studio M2 {{expressed an}} unofficial wish {{to produce an}} anime adaptation of the manga with his studio. Susumu Hirasawa, a composer who frequently worked on Kon's films, stated on Twitter in October 2017 that {{he was asked to}} work on a theme song for the series. However, it was not clear whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to Maruyama's desired project, as no announcements have been made for an anime adaptation of Opus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ghost of}} Hamlet's late {{father is a}} {{character}} from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. In the stage directions <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>referred</b> to as [...] "Ghost."

25|$|Writers, {{including}} Moro's brother, underlined how the BR's communication lacked {{any reference}} to the possible role of the Communist Party in the Italian government. This was {{in spite of the}} day chosen for the kidnapping being that in which PCI, {{for the first time since}} the early republican years, was going to obtain an active government role in Italy. A letter by Moro to Zaccagnini, in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to this argument, had to be rewritten by the politician.|$|E
25|$|The word Finn {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the form fenni in the 1st century AD by Tacitus, the Roman historian. However {{it is possible that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to the people of northern Europe in general, particularly the Lappic or Sami people. After that the name finni is used by Claudius Ptolemaeus (around 150) and the Eastern Roman writer Jordanes in his Getica (551). References to Finnic tribes become much more numerous from the Viking era (800-1050). It was not until about 1171 that the word Finni was employed to mean the Finns.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to {{the ship}} Polaris's return voyage southward down the Kennedy channel. This does not answer when it was named. However, the ship's doctor {{and leader of the}} {{scientific}} part of the expedition, Emil Bessels, wrote of it in his own book, Die amerikanische Nordpol-Expedition (1879). On page 124 he tells that on August 29, 1871, on the voyage north through Kennedy Channel, the Polaris sailed between Grinnell-land (Ellesmere Island) and a small unknown island which they later named Hans Island, after his native Greenlandic helper, Hans Hendrik.|$|E

25|$|In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) {{that the}} USA would support Britain’s “strategic, {{political}} and economic position in the Middle East”. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that “the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than we thought wise” (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to the Schuman Plan {{to set up the}} European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was “different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them”.|$|E
25|$|Western {{presence}} in the region started with the Portuguese, who captured Malacca in 1511. As they began trading for the sandalwood at Timor, their {{presence in}} the region increased. Solor was described by Tomé Pires in his Suma Oriental, although some scholars believe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to nearby larger Flores, mentioning abundance of exported sulphur and foodstuffs. By 1515, there was trade between both Flores and Solor with the foreigners, and by 1520 a small Portuguese settlement has been constructed in Lifau, at Solor. The trade in sandalwood also attracted Chinese and Dutch along with nearer Makassarese, creating competition. The Makassarese attacked and captured Larantuka in 1541 to extend their control over the sandalwood trade and in 1613, the Dutch destroyed the Portuguese base at Solor before establishing themselves at modern Kupang.|$|E
25|$|According to the OFAC, this {{sanction}} {{was part}} of a joint effort with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles to work with the Mexican government. The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally with drug money invested in the economy. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a wire tap phone conversation Abigael had with Diana María Sánchez Carlón, one of his financial assistants. In that conversation, Abigael asked her how his hotel was doing, prompting the U.S. government to investigate what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to exactly. Sánchez Carlón was introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho Cázares, a close friend of hers and wife of Abigael. Both Sánchez Carlón and Camacho Cázares were sanctioned through the Kingpin Act for their alleged role in money laundering.|$|E

5000|$|Barney (voiced by Rob Tinkler) - A {{very rich}} billionaire who owns {{multiple}} businesses around Peaceville. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> always {{addressed by the}} name of the business in front of his real name: such as while he works at the salad restaurant <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>referred</b> to as [...] "Salad Barney", or at the coffee house <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>referred</b> to as [...] "Bean Barney".|$|R
25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that the {{instrument}} panel readings he was seeing {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> {{to the fact that the}} plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of [...] "Thule", first mentioned by Pytheas of Massilia {{when he visited}} Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC is not known for certain. When Tacitus mentioned it in AD 98 it is clear <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to Shetland.|$|E

500|$|The late 4th-century {{writer on}} {{military}} affairs Vegetius complains of contemporary young men joining the [...] "auxilia" [...] in preference to the [...] "legions" [...] {{to avoid the}} latter's tougher training and duties. But {{it is unclear what}} types of units <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to. It is possible that those older terms were still popularly used (misleadingly) to mean limitanei and comitatenses respectively. In any event, his quote in no way describes accurately the Principate auxilia, many of which were of very high quality.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Old English word ċēo (pronounced with initial ch) gave modern English [...] "chough"; Chaucer {{sometimes used}} this word {{to refer to}} the western jackdaw, as did Shakespeare in Hamlet although there has been debate about which species <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> to. This onomatopoeic name, based on the western jackdaw's call, now refers to corvids of the genus Pyrrhocorax; the red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as the [...] "Cornish chough" [...] and then just the [...] "chough", the name transferring from one species to the other.|$|E
500|$|At 4:30 p.m., Hood {{stood in}} his {{stirrups}} {{at the front of}} the Texas Brigade and shouted, [...] "Fix bayonets, my brave Texans! Forward and take those heights!" [...] It is unclear to which heights <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring.</b> His orders were to cross the Emmitsburg Road and wheel left, moving north with his left flank guiding on the road. This discrepancy became a serious problem when, minutes later on Slyder's Lane, Hood was felled by an artillery shell bursting overhead, severely wounding his left arm and putting him out of action. His division moved ahead to the east, no longer under central control.|$|E
