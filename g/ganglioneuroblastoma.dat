40|$|The ligand {{specificity}} of the integrin cell adhesion receptors probably determines {{the ability of}} specific integrins to promote tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Therefore, we compared the expression of integrin alphaVbeta 3, a promiscuous receptor that binds with high affinity to numerous cell matrix proteins, with the expression of integrin alphaVbeta 5 and the integrin beta 1 subunit (which pairs with multiple alpha subunits) in neuroblastic tumors at various stages of differentiation. Undifferentiated neuroblastoma tumors rapidly invade and metastasize, whereas <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> rarely metastasize. Differentiating neuroblastomas are associated with an intermediate prognosis. Paraffin sections of neuroblastic tumors at various stages of differentiation obtained at biopsy from 17 patients were hybridized with antisense integrin subunit-specific alphaV, beta 3, beta 1, and beta 5 riboprobes. All neuroblastic tumors and seven adrenal glands obtained at autopsy were analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies directed toward the alphaV, beta 3, beta 1, and beta 5 subunits. The alphaV subunit was expressed in neuroblastic tumors independent of the stage of differentiation, although mRNA and protein expression were generally weak in <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> and was also detected in adrenal gland medullae. The beta 1 subunit was detected in most neuroblastic tumors independent of the stage of differentiation {{as well as in}} adrenal gland medullae. In contrast, the beta 3 subunit, which was not expressed in adrenal gland medullae, was expressed at the protein and mRNA levels in undifferentiated neuroblastomas (six of seven and seven of seven, respectively) but was not expressed in neuroblasts or ganglion cells in <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> (one case weakly positive out of five). The beta 5 subunit was expressed at the protein (five of five) and mRNA (four of five) levels in the ganglion cells of <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> and, although mRNA for this subunit was detectable in undifferentiated tumors, the protein was not detectable. The expression of integrin alphaVbeta 3 in undifferentiated neuroblastomas may contribute to the rapid growth of these tumors and their tendency to metastasize...|$|R
40|$|The metastatic {{potential}} of undifferentiated neuroblastomas is typically lost when differentiation into <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> occurs spontaneously or is induced. Cell adhesion {{may play a}} role in metastasis, and we have shown recently that expression of integrin alpha v beta 5 protein and mRNA is up-regulated in <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> in vivo. To investigate whether interactions of alpha v beta 5 with matrix components play a role in the loss of metastatic potential, we used immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization to analyze neuroblastic tumors at various stages of differentiation for expression of the alpha v beta 5 ligands, vitronectin and osteopontin, and determined the ability of vitronectin to promote attachment and neurite outgrowth in vitro in a retinoic-acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cell model. We found that vitronectin, but not osteopontin, was expressed in 5 of 5 <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> but was absent or weakly expressed in 6 of 6 undifferentiated neuroblastomas. Neuronal cell vitronectin was detected in 7 of 9 ganglioneuromas, 5 of 8 peripheral ganglia, and 14 of 21 adrenal gland medullae, confirming expression of vitronectin in mature peripheral neurons. In vitro, vitronectin promoted attachment of both undifferentiated and retinoic-acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cells, which was inhibited 20 and 60 %, respectively, by monoclonal antibody anti-integrin alpha v beta 5. Vitronectin-promoted neurite outgrowth of retinoic-acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cells was not inhibited by monoclonal antibody anti-alpha v beta 5. These data suggest that the synthesis of vitronectin and the ability of integrin alpha v beta 5 to mediate vitronectin adhesion on retinoic-acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cells may promote differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vivo...|$|R

40|$|During {{a six-year}} period (1973 - 9) 52 {{patients}} with pancreatic tumours and 10 with <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> {{were found to}} have raised plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) concentrations. All the patients had severe secretory diarrhoea, weight loss, dehydration, hypokalaemic acidosis, and a raised plasma urea concentration. Reduced gastric acid secretion was seen in 72 % of patients. Plasma VIP concentrations were not raised in patients with diarrhoea due to other types of tumour or disease or in hormone-secreting tumours not associated with diarrhoea. Plasma VIP measurement may therefore give clinical guidance in a patient with persistent watery diarrhoea and hypokalaemic acidosis.

30|$|<b>Ganglioneuroblastomas</b> (GNBs) {{are derived}} from neural crest cells and {{comprised}} a mixture of neuroblasts and ganglion cells [1]. Some GNBs produce catecholamines [2], {{making it difficult to}} distinguish them from paragangliomas by using catecholamine dynamics, such as the 24 -h urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites, or by 123 I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123 I-MIBG) scintigraphy. Surgical resection is the primary choice for both types of tumor; however, intraoperative blood pressure fluctuations present a high risk of complications, particularly in patients with abnormal hypertension. If the patient has a cerebral aneurysm, an even more careful strategy is needed. Here, we report an interesting surgical case of an adult patient with a catecholamine-producing GNB in her adrenal gland, leading us to suspect it to be a pheochromocytoma, as well as a cerebral aneurysm.|$|R

50|$|Neuroblastoma is an {{aggressive}} cancer of immature neuroblastic cells (precursors of neurons), {{and is one}} of the most common pediatric cancers, with a median age at diagnosis of two years. Adrenal neuroblastoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. Although the tumor has often spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, this cancer is unusual in that many cases are highly curable when the spread is limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (stage IVS). Related, but less aggressive tumors composed of more mature neural cells include <b>ganglioneuroblastoma</b> and ganglioneuroma. Neuroblastic tumors often produce elevated levels of catecholamine hormone precursors, such as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, and may produce severe watery diarrhea through production of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Treatment of neuroblastoma includes surgery and radiation therapy for localized disease, and chemotherapy for metastatic disease.|$|E

The presence of DLK has been studied by standard immunohistochemistry in 31 hepatoblastomas and in several differential diagnostically related tumours: hepatocellular carcinomas and in undifferentiated childhood neoplasms. All the hepatoblastomas were positive for DLK; the surrounding liver tissue remained negative. The reaction was present in the epithelial component of the tumours. The staining pattern was mostly membranous, occasionally cytoplasmic. The other studied tumours were negative for DLK, except one hepatocellular carcinoma and the differentiating cells of two <b>ganglioneuroblastomas.</b> Therefore, DLK seems to be a highly sensitive and specific marker for hepatoblastomas...|$|R
40|$|The human trkA cDNA was {{transfected}} into {{a malignant}} human neuroblastoma (NB) cell line (HTLA 230) to investigate {{its role in}} NB growth and differentiation. This cell line lacks expression of both endogenous trkA and gp 75 NGFR genes. Transfectants expressing the trkA mRNA and surface-bound receptors transcriptionally activate immediate-early genes (c-fos, c-jun, and jun-B) following nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation. NGF treatment induces growth arrest as well as down-regulation of the amplified N-myc oncogene. Genes selectively expressed in mature neurons (SCG- 10, ret proto-oncogene, GAP- 43, etc.) are transcriptionally activated, and neurite outgrowth further demonstrates differentiation of transfectants following NGF stimulation. trkA-expressing NB cells remain tumorigenic in nude mice; however, subcutaneous treatment of tumor-bearing mice with NGF induces Schwannian and neuronal cell differentiation similar to the induction seen in human <b>ganglioneuroblastomas.</b> Thus, trkA expression in HTLA 230 cells is sufficient to generate a functional NGF receptor complex that leads to growth-arrested and differentiated NB cells in vitro and in vivo {{in the presence of}} NGF. Hence, NGF may {{play a crucial role in}} NB cell differentiation and regression in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Retroperitoneal and {{posterior}} thoracic neurogenic {{tumors are}} rare tumors {{and may have}} different origins: ganglion cell (ganglioneuromas, <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> neuroblastomas), paraganglionic system (paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas) and nerve sheath (schwannomas, neurofibromas, malignant nerve sheath tumors). Nerve sheath tumors are mostly benign tumors. These tumors usually present late and cause symptoms or become palpable once they have reached a significant size. Good quality cross-sectional imaging is necessary to evaluate these types of tumors and the diagnosis may be suggested by the imaging appearance of the lesion, including its location, shape, and internal structure. Distinguish between benign and malignant tumors is difficult to make preoperatively unless distant metastases are present. A core needle biopsy may be helpful but tumor location and its frequently encountered close relations with vascular structures preclude it. Surgery remains the mainstay of curative therapy for these tumors.

All 8 paragangliomas contained cells that were positive for the 68 -kd component, but only 5 of them had cells positive for the 150 -kd and 200 -kd components. All 4 ganglioneuromas and 11 <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> contained cells that reacted with antibodies to all three components. All 7 neuroblastomas had cells reacting with antibody to 68 kd, but only 3 of them had cells that reacted with antibodies to 150 kd and 200 kd.

40|$|Somatostatin {{receptor}} (SSTR) expressions in neuroblastomas (NBs) {{have been}} confirmed employing various methods. High SSTR- 2 expression was suggested to be a favorable prognostic marker, though {{little is known about}} the relationships between the expressions of SSTR subtypes, other than SSTR- 2, and prognosis. We investigated the expressions of all five known SSTR subtypes in 63 neuroblastic tumors (NTs), employing immunohistochemistry, and also conducted quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 37 of these tumors. We evaluated correlations between the expressions of SSTR subtypes and prognosis, based on the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification and patient outcomes. More than 90 % of cases expressed, at a minimum, SSTR- 1 and/or 2. Ganglioneuromas and <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> expressed more than two SSTR subtypes. Among NBs, the favorable histology group showed higher SSTR subtype expressions than the unfavorable histology group. The same tendency was observed when surviving and deceased cases were compared, though SSTR- 2 expression was well preserved in some of the deceased cases. In conclusion, NTs highly expressed SSTR- 1 and/or 2, and expressions of SSTR generally indicate a good prognosis. However, even those in the unfavorable histology group with NBs expressing SSTR are good candidates for molecular targeting therapy using somatostatin analogues...|$|R
40|$|To {{establish}} the neuroendocrine and neural features of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, a prospectively collected group of 12 neuroblastomas (NB), 2 <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> (GNB), and 4 ganglioneuromas (GN) was probed with {{a panel of}} monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to neuroendocrine and neural antigens. All tumors expressed the pan-neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A. They also showed extensive expression of neuronal antigens, ie, {{of each of the}} neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins and of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP 2 and tau-protein. However, only in the GNBs and GNs was the pattern of NF phosphoisoforms relatively mature. In the latter tumors glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) could be demonstrated as well, suggesting the presence of nonmyelinating and myelinating Schwann cells, respectively. The glial markers did not colocalize with the neural markers. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that all peripheral neuroblastic tumors manifest molecular characteristics of neuroendocrine cells and of neurons. The latter were most developed in GNBs and GNs, in which they were accompanied by Schwann cell differentiation in a separate population of cells. The above-outlined neuronal profile of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, including NBs, distinguishes this group of tumors from the much-less neuronally differentiated primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system...|$|R

40|$|The adrenal scintiscan with 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a {{reliable}} morphofunctional technique to evaluate catecholamine turnover in adrenal tumors, {{can be a}} useful method to investigate adrenal incidentalomas with arterial hypertension. A male patient, 44 yr old with diabetes, unstable arterial hypertension, and sudden paroxysms of tachycardia is described. The presence of a disomogeneous right juxta-adrenal neoplasm with calcifications was evidenced with ultrasound tomography and confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) scan. Adrenal 123 I-MIBG scintiscan revealed a unilateral uptake at level of the right juxta-adrenal region, sized similarly to the neoplasm previously evidence by CT scan. Histological findings of the surgically removed neoplasm were consistent with an ancient schwannoma. Apart from pheochromocytomas, the MIBG uptake is commonly reported in neuroblastomas. In neuroblastoma, a bidirectional process of transdifferentiation has been previously reported in vitro between two coexistent cells: cells with specific uptake system for norepinephrine, with 123 I-MIBG uptake capability, and cells oriented toward schwann/melanocytic line. The evidence of in vivo MIBG uptake in our schwannoma {{may be caused by}} the same possible phenotypic interconversion of above mentioned cell types. In conclusion, the presence of adrenal tumors with MIBG uptake capability, apart from pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas, <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> and ganglioneuromas, must be considered in the diagnosis of adrenal tumors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Neuroblastic tumors {{include the}} neuroblastomas, <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> and ganglioneuromas. Clinical {{behavior}} of these developmental malignancies varies from regression to aggressive growth with metastatic dissemination. Several clinical, histological, genetic, and biological features {{are associated with}} this diversity of clinical presentations. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein coupled receptor with {{a key role in}} calcium homeostasis. We have previously reported that it is expressed in benign, differentiated neuroblastic tumors, but silenced by genetic and epigenetic events in unfavorable neuroblastomas. We have now analyzed three functionally relevant polymorphisms clustered at the signal transduction region of the CaSR (rs 1801725, rs 1042636 and rs 1801726) to assess if genetic variants producing a less active receptor are associated with more aggressive disease course. Methods: Polymorphisms were analyzed in DNA samples from 65 patients using specific Taqman Genotyping Assays. Results: Mildly inactivating variant rs 1801725 was associated with clinical stage 4 (P = 0. 002) and the histological subgroup of undifferentiated neuroblastomas (P = 0. 046). Patients harboring this polymorphism had significantly lower overall (P = 0. 022) and event-free survival (P = 0. 01) rates than those who were homozygous for the most common allele among Caucasians. However, this single locus genotype was not independently associated with outcome in multivariate analyses.

40|$|Neuroblastoma, {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring extracranial solid tumor of childhood, arises from neural crest-derived cells that are arrested {{at an early stage}} of differentiation in the developing sympathetic nervous system. There is an urgent need to identify clinically relevant biomarkers for better prognosis and treatment of this aggressive malignancy. Eyes Absent 1 (EYA 1) is an essential transcriptional coactivator for neuronal developmental programs during organogenesis. Whether or not EYA 1 is implicated in neuroblastoma and subcellular localization of EYA 1 is relevant to clinical behaviour of neuroblastoma is not known. We studied EYA 1 expression and subcellular localization by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing tumor specimens from 98 patients, 66 of which were characterized by known clinical prognostic markers of neuroblastoma. Immunostaining results were evaluated and statistically correlated with the degree of histologic differentiation and with neuroblastoma risk stratification group characteristics, including stage of disease, patient age, tumor histology and mitosis–karyorrhexis index (MKI), respectively. We found that EYA 1 levels were significantly higher in neuroblastomas than in ganglioneuromas and <b>ganglioneuroblastomas.</b> EYA 1 was more highly expressed in stage 1, 2, 3 or 4 S tumors as compared to stage 4 tumors (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} (TGF) -betas are a highly conserved group of potent multifunctional cell regulatory proteins with variable effects on cell growth and differentiation. Most {{of the small}} round cell group of childhood tumors are thought to arise from either primitive mesenchyme or neuroectoderm and show evidence of skeletal muscle or neural differentiation, and rarely both. To investigate {{the possibility that the}} TGF-betas have a role in the growth or differentiation of these neoplasms, we used antibodies specific for peptide sequences of the three known mammalian TGF-beta isoforms (TGF-betas 1, 2, and 3) to probe for TGF-beta protein expression in a total of 49 cases. TGF-beta 1 immunoreactivity was present in 16 / 17 (94 %) of rhabdomyosarcomas, and the staining intensity was usually strong. TGF-beta 1 was also present in three of three ectomesenchymomas. In contrast, TGF-beta 1 was absent in all but one out of nine poorly differentiated neuroblastomas. Differentiating neuronal cells of <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> however, were strongly positive for TGF-beta 1. Ewing's sarcomas and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors had a less consistent, but usually positive, staining pattern. TGF-beta 3 staining patterns were very similar to those of TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 2 immunoreactivity was only rarely detected in this group of tumors. The results suggest different roles for TGF-betas 1 and 3 in neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Expression of TGF-betas 1 and 3 is associated with neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma.

At least five of them recognize different epitopes of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). It was found that all of 12 neuroblastomas, 2 <b>ganglioneuroblastomas</b> and 4 ganglioneuromas as well as 23 central primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 13 astrocytomas and 4 ependymomas share "neural/neuroendocrine" antigens (as defined by the anti-N-CAM antibodies Moc- 1, - 21, - 32, - 52 and - 191) with SCLC. The "neural/neuroendocrine" antigen defined by Moc- 171 was also found in all peripheral tumors, but only in further differentiated central tumors. Non-N-CAM related "neural" antigens (as defined by Moc- 51 and - 172) were found only in better-differentiated peripheral and central tumors, but they could be demonstrated in all three medulloblastoma cell lines studied.

We also examined 46 adrenal lesions (3 hyperplasias, 3 adenomas and 35 adrenocortical carcinomas, 2 pheochromocytomas, 2 <b>ganglioneuroblastomas,</b> and 1 lymphoma) and 24 breast cancers (6 noninvasive, 16 infiltrating ductal, and 2 invasive lobular tumors). The PCR product of 5 tumors suspected to present band shifts by SSCP was cloned. Direct sense and antisense sequencing did not identify mutations. These results suggest that the MEN 1 gene is not important in breast, thyroid or adrenal sporadic tumorigenesis. Because the frequency of mutations varies significantly among tumor subgroups and allelic deletions are frequently observed at 11 q 13 in thyroid and adrenal cancers, another tumor suppressor gene residing in this region is likely {{to be involved in the}} tumorigenesis of these neoplasms...|$|R
