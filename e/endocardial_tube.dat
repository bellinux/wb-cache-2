5000|$|Haeckel {{argues that}} certain {{features}} in embryonic development are conserved and palingenetic, {{while others are}} caenogenetic. Caenogenesis represents “the blurring of ancestral resemblances in development,” which {{are said to be}} the result of certain adaptations to embryonic life due to environmental changes. [...] In his drawings, Haeckel cites the notochord, pharyngeal arches and clefts, pronephros and neural tube as palingenetic features. However, the yolk sac, extra-embryonic membranes, egg membranes and <b>endocardial</b> <b>tube</b> are considered caenogenetic features. [...] The addition of terminal adult stages and the telescoping, or driving back, of such stages to descendant’s embryonic stages are likewise representative of Haeckelian embryonic development. In addressing his embryo drawings to a general audience, Haeckel does not cite any sources, which gives his opponents the freedom to make assumptions regarding the originality of his work.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{development}} is a dynamic process during which progressive specification and differentiation of cardiovascular progenitor cells are intrinsically linked to complex morphogenetic events conferring function to the forming heart. 1, 2 Cardiogenesis initiates in the meso-derm of the anterior lateral region of the early embryo in response to inductive signals from surrounding tissues. Differentiation of the first cardiomyocytes surrounding an <b>endocardial</b> <b>tube</b> is rapidly fol-lowed by formation of a linear heart tube that subsequently elongates, loops {{to the right and}} undergoes ballooning morphogenesis to gener-ate distinct atrial and ventricular chambers. Cardiac valve develop-ment, septation, and establishment of the coronary vasculature and conduction system follow as the heart acquires its definitive form. Defects in these processes result {{in a wide range of}} congenital heart anomalies, including major life-threatening defects such as cardiac arrhythmias and failure to separate systemic and pulmonar...|$|E
50|$|The <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> are paired {{regions in}} the embryo that appear in its ventral pole {{by the middle of}} the third week of {{gestation}} and consist of precursor cells for the development of the embryonic heart. The <b>endocardial</b> heart <b>tubes</b> derive from the visceral mesoderm and initially are formed by a confluence of angioblastic blood vessels on either side of the embryonic midline. The <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> have an intimate proximity to the foregut or pharyngeal endoderm.|$|R
25|$|From splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, the {{cardiogenic}} region develops cranially and laterally to {{the neural}} plate. In this area, two separate angiogenic cell clusters form {{on either side}} and coalesce to form the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes.</b> As embryonic folding continues, the two <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days.|$|R

40|$|SummaryCardiovascular {{function}} {{depends on}} patent blood vessel formation by endothelial cells (ECs). However, the mechanisms underlying vascular “tubulogenesis” are {{only beginning to}} be unraveled. We show that endothelial tubulogenesis requires the Ras interacting protein 1, Rasip 1, and its binding partner, the RhoGAP Arhgap 29. Mice lacking Rasip 1 fail to form patent lumens in all blood vessels, including the early <b>endocardial</b> <b>tube.</b> Rasipl null angioblasts fail to properly localize the polarity determinant Par 3 and display defective cell polarity, resulting in mislocalized junctional complexes and loss of adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Similarly, depletion of either Rasip 1 or Arhgap 29 in cultured ECs blocks in vitro lumen formation, fundamentally alters the cytoskeleton, and reduces integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM. These defects result from increased RhoA/ROCK/myosin II activity and blockade of Cdc 42 and Rac 1 signaling. This study identifies Rasip 1 as a unique, endothelial-specific regulator of Rho GTPase signaling, which is essential for blood vessel morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Sox 7, - 17 and - 18 {{constitute}} the Sox subgroup F (SoxF) of HMG box transcription factor genes, which all are co-expressed in developing vascular endothelial cells in mice. Here we characterized cardiovascular phenotypes of Sox 17 /Sox 18 -double and Sox 17 -single null embryos during early-somite stages. Whole-mount PECAM staining demonstrated the aberrant heart looping, enlarged cardinal vein and mild defects in anterior dorsal aorta formation in Sox, 17 single-null embryos. The Sox 17 /Sox 18 double-null embryos showed more severe defects in formation of anterior dorsal aorta and head/cervical microvasculature, {{and in some}} cases, aberrant differentiation of endocardial cells and defective fusion of the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tube.</b> However, the posterior dorsal aorta and allantoic micro vasculature was properly formed {{in all of the}} Sox 17 /Sox 18 double-null embryos. The anomalies in both anterior dorsal aorta and head/cervical vasculature corresponded with the weak Sox 7 expression sites. This suggests the region-specific redundant activities of three SoxF members along the anteroposterior axis of embryonic vascular network. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe endocardium {{forms the}} inner {{lining of the}} heart tube, where it enables blood flow and also interacts with the {{myocardium}} during the formation of valves and trabeculae. Although {{a number of studies}} have identified regulators in the morphogenesis of the myocardium, relatively little is known about the molecules that control endocardial morphogenesis. Prior work has implicated the bHLH transcription factor Tal 1 in <b>endocardial</b> <b>tube</b> formation: in zebrafish embryos lacking Tal 1, endocardial cells form a disorganized mass within the ventricle and do not populate the atrium. Through blastomere transplantation, we find that tal 1 plays a cell-autonomous role in regulating endocardial extension, suggesting that Tal 1 activity influences the behavior of individual endocardial cells. The defects in endocardial behavior in tal 1 -deficient embryos originate during the earliest steps of endocardial morphogenesis: tal 1 -deficient endocardial cells fail to generate a cohesive monolayer at the midline and instead pack tightly together into a multi-layered aggregate. Moreover, the tight junction protein ZO- 1 is mislocalized in the tal 1 -deficient endocardium, indicating a defect in intercellular junction formation. In addition, we find that the tal 1 -deficient endocardium fails to maintain its identity; over time, a progressively increasing number of tal 1 -deficient endocardial cells initiate myocardial gene expression. However, the onset of defects in intercellular junction formation precedes the onset of ectopic myocardial gene expression in the tal 1 -deficient endocardium. We therefore propose a model in which Tal 1 has distinct roles in regulating the formation of endocardial intercellular junctions and maintaining endocardial identity...|$|E
50|$|As folding of {{the embryo}} in the {{horizontal}} plane initiates in the 4th week of gestation, the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> {{meet in the}} midline to form the primitive heart tube, which will eventually develop into the histologically definitive endocardium. The myocardium forms from mesoderm cells surrounding the heart tube, while the epicardium develops from other cells, most likely from neural crest cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{differentiation}} {{of the heart}} was examined in mouse embryos, isolated between the afternoons of the eighth and ninth day of gestation, by means of scanning electron microscopy {{as well as by}} light microscopy of standard histological material and thin plastic sections. Cavitation within the presumptive pericardial mesoderm commences during the late presomite stage (afternoon of eighth day) and myocardial rudiments are established by thickening of the pericardial lining adjacent to the endoderm near the base of the foregut pocket. At first the thickening lies on the ventral aspect of the pericardial cavity but, as the foregut pocket deepens and the trunk region of the embryo moves en masse caudally and ventrally, it comes to lie on the dorsal wall. A separate layer of cells comprising the primitive endocardium differentiates deep to the myocardial thickening, between the latter and the endoderm. Cavitation of the endocardial tissue occurs bilaterally about the 1 - 2 somite stage so as to establish bilateral <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes.</b> These <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> become enclosed within the myocardial mantle which bulges into the pericardial cavity. A layer of acellular material (the cardiac jelly) appears between the endocardium and myocardium at about this time. At about the 4 -somite stage, the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> coalesce across the mid-line to establish a single median cardiac tube, and the entire heart rudiment is suspended in the mid-line by a wide dorsal mesocardium. Our observations indicate that, contrary to previous views, at no time during cardiogenesis in the mouse are two distinct heart primordia present which subsequently fuse to form a single median entity. The principal similarities and differences between cardiogenesis in the mouse, and mammals in general, and avians are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Heart {{development}} {{refers to}} the prenatal development of the human heart. This begins {{with the formation of}} two <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube, that loops and septates into the four chambers and paired arterial trunks that form the adult heart. The heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.|$|R
25|$|The rhythmic {{electrical}} depolarization {{waves that}} trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, {{which means that}} they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. Myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a syncytium. Myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes.</b> The heartbeat begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of myocardium.|$|R
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the third}} week of development, the <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> have {{developed}} a swelling in the part closest to the heart. The swelling is known as the bulbus cordis and the upper part of this swelling develops into the truncus arteriosus [...] The structure is ultimately mesodermal in origin. During development of the heart, the heart tissues undergo folding, and the truncus arteriosus is exposed to what will eventually be both the left and right ventricles. As a septum develops between the two ventricles of the heart, two bulges form {{on either side of the}} truncus arteriosus. These progressively enlarge until the trunk splits into the aorta and pulmonary arteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{heart is}} the first {{functional}} organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around 21 or 22 days. Cardiac myoblasts and blood islands in the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme {{on each side of}} the neural plate, give rise to the cardiogenic region.This is a horseshoe-shaped area near to the head of the embryo. By day 19, following cell signalling, two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them. These two <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the thoracic cavity.|$|R
2500|$|At around 18 to 19 {{days after}} fertilisation, the heart begins to form. This early {{development}} {{is critical for}} subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 21 or 22. The heart begins to develop near {{the head of the}} embryo in the cardiogenic area. Following cell signalling, two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic [...] region As these form, a lumen develops within them, at which point, they are referred to as <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes.</b> At {{the same time that the}} tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed. The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. The truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venous will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.|$|R
40|$|Basement {{membranes}} (BMs) {{constitute a}} distinct compartment of the extracellular matrix (ECM). All BMs show a similar structural appearance but differ in molecular composition. These variations have critical functional implications. The {{aim of this}} study is to establish the pattern of the tomato lectin (Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin [...] LEA) binding sites in the BMs of the developing chick embryo (stages 4 - 21, Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951) in order to achieve a better understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of BMs. The study was performed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) histochemistry, and confocal laser microscopy. TEM showed that LEA bound to the lamina densa and to the lamina fibroreticularis of the BMs. Through the period studied, most of the LEA binding appeared in the ectodermal BM and its derivatives. In the limb bud, LEA binding to the ectoderm BM was more intense in the ventral half than in the dorsal half. Furthermore, LEA allowed the early (HH 16) detection of the transverse fibrillar tracts. In the lens and in the inner ear primordium, the BMs were LEA positive through the placode and cup stages. The binding was progressively reduced through the vesicle stage. The BMs of the olfactory primordium, and of the Rathke's pouch were positive. In contrast, the BMs of the developing central nervous system were negative. The BMs of both the paraxial and the lateral plates of the mesoderm were negative, whereas the notochord and the BM of the Wolffian duct were positive. The endodermal BM and its derivatives were negative. The ECM located between the fusing <b>endocardial</b> <b>tubes,</b> and the BM of the fusion zone of the paired aortae, were positive. This suggested an active role of the LEA-positive glycoproteins in the fusion of endothelia. Our results show the heterogeneity of the chick embryo BMs during development. In addition, LEA constitutes an excellent marker for the primordial germ cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart is}} a complex multichambered organ consisting of two ventricles, two atria, outflow tract and inflow tract, conduction system, valves, endocardi-um, and epicardium. The proper function of the whole heart requires a highly coordinated process of differentia-tion and integration {{of all of the}} cellular components (Olson 2006; Srivastava 2006). One of the central ques-tions in cardiovascular biology relates to how these vari-ous components are assembled from early mesodermal precursors located in the heart field in the early mam-malian embryo. The cardiac precursor cells are specified in the anterior part of the primitive streak shortly after gastrulation. These precursor cells migrate toward the anterior lateral plate mesoderm and form a pair of cardiac crescents, the first visible and morphologically distinguishable structure of the cardiac primordia. <b>Endocardial</b> <b>tubes</b> are already formed in each of cardiac crescents at this stage. As the neuroectoderm develops rapidly at this stage, the heart-forming region is pushed ventrally and fuses to form a single linear heart tube. It has been long thought that the identity of each heart chamber is already specified at an early stage within each segment of the linear heart tube— outflow tract, right ventricle, left ventricle, atria, and sinus venosus, from the cranial to caudal direction. The discovery of the second progenitor source has begun to challenge this classical segmental prespecification view of cardiogenesis and is reshaping our view of congenital heart abnormalities (Buckingham et al. 2005). This second source of cardiac progenitors is formed in the dorsomedial part of the anterior lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to the cardiac crescent (Fig. 1). Recently, this extra-crescent heart field (second heart field; SHF) was revisited and character-ized by several different techniques: dye labeling, detection of specific molecular markers, and retrospective single-cell-fate tracing experiments (Kelly et al. 2001; Mjaatved...|$|R
