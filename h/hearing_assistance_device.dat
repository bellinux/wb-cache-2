40|$|The {{application}} {{relates to}} a bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> system comprising {{first and second}} <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>devices,</b> {{each of the first}} and second <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>devices</b> being adapted for being located at or in an ear of the user or to be partially or fully implanted in the head at an ear of the user, comprising a processing unit, which in a NORMAL mode of operation is adapted to process an input audio signal based on configurable processing parameters and to provide a processed electric stimulation signal, and comprising an output unit operationally connected to said processing unit in said NORMAL mode of operation and adapted to present an electric stimulation signal input to said user in a form allowing it to be perceived by the user as an auditory signal, the bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> system further comprising one or more stimulation units for - in a TEST mode of operation of the <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> system - delivering first and second electric TEST stimulation signals to said output units of said first and second <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>devices,</b> respectively. The application further relates to a method of fitting a bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> system to a particular user. The object of the present application is to provide a measure allowing an improved fitting of bilaterally implanted Cochlear Implant users. The problem is solved in that the bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> system further comprises an evaluation unit configured to analyze the recorded physiological response of the user and to provide an objective measure of the user's perception of said TEST stimulation signals. This has the advantage of providing an improved speech intelligibility and preservation of spatial cues.

5000|$|Sound World Solutions was {{established}} in 2007 by Dr. Stavros Basseas, an engineer and hearing aid technologist, and David Green, a specialist in public health projects for developing markets, to develop low-cost <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>devices.</b> These devices can be adjusted using a tablet or laptop computer program or a smartphone application, instead of conventional clinical instruments, such as an audiometer, Hi-Pro box and anechoic chamber. As a result, these devices - classified as personal sound amplifiers in the U.S. - {{can be used as}} hearing aids in developing markets where such instrumentation does not commonly exist.This design platform was intended {{to address the needs of}} the approximately 1 billion people that The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates have some degree of hearing loss, including 328 million who experience disabling hearing loss.

40|$|Listening effort {{helps explain}} why people who are hard of hearing are prone to fatigue and social withdrawal. However, a one-factor model that cites only effort due to {{hardness}} of hearing is insufficient as {{there are many who}} lead happy lives despite their disability. This paper explores other contributory factors, in particular motivational arousal and pleasure. The theory of rational motivational arousal predicts that some people forego listening comprehension because they believe it to be impossible and hence worth no effort at all. This is problematic. Why should the listening task be rated this way, given the availability of aids that reduce its difficulty? Two additional factors narrow the explanatory gap. First, we separate the listening task from the benefit derived as a consequence. The latter is temporally more distant, and is discounted as a result. The second factor is displeasure attributed to the listening task, which increases listening cost. Many who are hard of hearing enjoy social interaction. In such cases, the actual activity of listening is a benefit, not a cost. These people also reap the benefits of listening, but do not have to balance these against the displeasure of the task. It is suggested that if motivational harmony can be induced by training in somebody who is hard of hearing, then the obstacle to motivational arousal would be removed. This suggests a modified goal for health care professionals. Don’t just teach those who are hard of hearing how to use <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>devices.</b> Teach them how to do so with pleasure and enjoymen...|$|R

50|$|VADs are {{distinct}} from artificial hearts, which {{are designed to}} assume cardiac function, and generally require {{the removal of the}} patient's heart. Moreover, VADs are designed to assist either the right ventricle (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular <b>assistance</b> <b>device</b> applied depends upon the type of underlying heart disease, and upon the pulmonary arterial-resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left-ventricle <b>assistance</b> <b>device</b> (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (as it is sufficient in most cases -the right side of the heart is then often already able {{to make use of the}} heavily increased blood flow-), but when the pulmonary arterial-resistance is high, then an (additional) right-ventricle <b>assistance</b> <b>device</b> (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate long-term results and outcome after heart transplantation performed in patients with ventricular <b>assistance</b> <b>device</b> (VAD) versus no mechanical circulatory support. MethodsAll the patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2005 and 2012 were included in this monocentric retrospective study.

ResultsMean age was 46 ± 11 years in the VAD group vs 51 ± 13 years in the standard group (p= 0. 01) and 17 % of the VAD patients were women vs 25 % (p= 0. 21).

40|$|Dealing {{with pain}} is a {{significant}} challenge for owners of companion animals and the provider of their medical care. Managing pain goes far beyond the administration of medications. It includes developing a strategy that will increase patient strength and fitness, optimize the pet’s body weight, implement a home exercise program, make appropriate use of safe and effective ambulation <b>assistance</b> <b>devices,</b> and optimize the home environment. However, to allow an effective rehabilitation program to be implemented and to achieve optimum results, logical, safe, and effective use of analgesics is required. This therapy must be tailored to the individual animal, should be multi-modal, and needs constant reevaluation for efficacy and toxicity.

30|$|IABP is {{the most}} common {{mechanical}} circulatory <b>assistance</b> <b>device</b> for a variety of clinical conditions with cardiovascular disease. Since the introduction of the counterpulsation concept in the 1960 s, the indications for its use have expanded [7] and include acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, high-risk coronary intervention, and surgery for high-risk cardiovascular patients [8]. IABP improves myocardial perfusion and reduces afterload. Balloon inflation during diastole increases diastolic pressure, which improves myocardial perfusion, because coronary perfusion occurs mainly during diastole. In addition, balloon deflation during systole decreases systolic blood pressure, reducing the afterload and therefore the myocardial oxygen demand [8, 9].|$|R
