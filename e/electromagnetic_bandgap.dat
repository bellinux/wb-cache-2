The state of the prototype circuit, consisting of 24 unit cells, is changed by closing or opening gaps in selected unit cells.

To achieve common-mode suppression {{in a wide}} band, the common-mode impedance is modulated following a sinusoidal chirping, whereas the differential-mode impedance is kept unaltered, thus ensuring that the line is transparent for that mode. The result is a differential line exhibiting common-mode suppression in a band from 2. 45 GHz up to 7. 37 GHz centered at 5 GHz (98. 4 % bandwidth). As compared to previous works, based on single tuned or double tuned EBGs, the proposed technique is useful to achieve wider rejection bands for the common mode. Nevertheless, the authors also propose an alternative based on multi-tuned EBGs, {{in order to obtain}} a comparable fractional bandwidth.
