2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's <b>information</b> <b>strategy</b> for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E

40|$|Current vehicle {{navigation}} systems usually rely {{on global}} real-time traffic information. They suggest the best paths to travelers through {{an independent and}} selfish-routing mechanism. Existing studies show that such systems have a great potential to cause traffic congestions oscillating among several alternative corridors, i. e., iteratively leading exceeding traffic into light traffic corridors and making congestion on one and then another {{within a short time}} period. To address this issue, this research proposes a local <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy,</b> given travelers are still guided by an independent and selfish-routing mechanism. The coverage of the real-time information provision is identified by the minimum bounding rectangle, and the ellipse method respectively. The benefits of the proposed strategy in system level are investigated by the simulation studies built upon the Borman expressway network. The simulation results indicate that as the local travel time <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy</b> is used, it may save 10 – 25 % of the system travel time resulting from global <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy</b> under medium or high network traffic loads. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses indicate that the merits of the local travel time <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy</b> are more significant as the penetration of smart vehicles increases over the network. Thus, the proposed local <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy</b> outperforms global <b>information</b> provision <b>strategy</b> in system level network performance...|$|R
