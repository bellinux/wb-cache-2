It is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} three schools mentioned, this approach, {{associated}} with Joseph Maréchal (1878–1944), Karl Rahner (1904–84), and Bernard Lonergan (1904–84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a Cartesian subjectivist approach to knowledge in general, and Kantian epistemology in particular. It seems <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.|$|E

500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it is <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."

[...] "Over There" [...] marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe, a longer and [...] "much more involv" [...] shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, [...] "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." [...] Wyman elaborated that [...] "I think it's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you have not experienced the last of William Bell".

"It seems <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if the {{influence}} of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived," [...] wrote Miklós Rédei in John von Neumann: Selected Letters. James Glimm wrote: [...] "he is {{regarded as one of the}} giants of modern mathematics". The mathematician Jean Dieudonné said that von Neumann [...] "may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions", while Peter Lax described him as possessing the [...] "most scintillating intellect of this century". In the foreword of Miklós Rédei's Selected Letters, Peter Lax wrote, [...] "To gain a measure of von Neumann's achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Noble laureate or, possibly, a -fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics".|$|E

This particular collapse {{was not the first}} major interstate highway bridge failure attributed to scour of foundations.

500|$|Ponsford {{travelled}} to England for {{a second}} time, with the 1930 Australian team. In a wet summer, Australia won the series two Tests to one, recovering The Ashes. For {{the second time in}} as many trips to England, Ponsford fell ill—gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium. Despite this setback, Ponsford scored 330runs in the Tests at an average of 55.00. Wisden wrote, [...] "Ponsford had a much better season—especially in the Test matches—than four years previously.... In helping his captain to wear down England's bowling he accomplished great work and, even if he was seldom really attractive to watch, there could be no question about his skill and how difficult he was to get out." [...] The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman, who scored 974runs in the Test matches—this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series. Ponsford played a part in Bradman's success; Wisden stated that [...] "it is only <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{on more than one occasion}} [...] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford, by batting of different description, had taken the sting out of the England bowling." ...|$|E

[...] Those disputes, and a perceived slowness to complete his works (especially the Waterloo Medal) have been sources of the criticism by later writers. Howard Linecar, in his book on British coin designs and designers, wrote, [...] "there {{is little doubt that}} Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies as a bargaining counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint... On balance it is perhaps <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Pistrucci, having probably been promised that which he could not have... squeezed the last drop of blood out of the situation." [...] According to Clancy, [...] "With great talent can often come controversy and throughout his career Pistrucci was acclaimed and reviled in equal measure, maintaining a series of tense relationships with his colleagues, the most pointed of which [...] with his fellow engraver William Wyon." [...] Craig concluded, [...] "Apart from the George and Dragon design, which was less esteemed then than now... this artist's Mint works, unlike his private commissions, were failures".|$|E

[...] His review both criticised and praised the episode: he summarised the episode as [...] "bursting with a breathless ambition that papered over its occasional cracks"; but lamented that the plot detail felt [...] "muddled" [...] because of how many plot devices were compressed into the episode. Brew thought the ensemble of companions [...] "separated the great actors from the good": he complimented Sladen's and Cribbins's portrayal of fear; and he criticised UNIT, Torchwood, and the Doctor for uncharacteristically admitting defeat.

Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|R
