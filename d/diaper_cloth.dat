6000|$|The long narrow table {{under the}} big sycamores {{between the house and}} the adapted barn that Mr. Direck learnt was used for [...] "dancing and all that sort of thing," [...] was covered with a blue linen <b>diaper</b> <b>cloth,</b> and that too {{surprised}} him. This was his first meal in a private household in England, and for obscure reasons he had expected something very stiff and formal with [...] "spotless napery." [...] He had also expected a very stiff and capable service by implacable parlourmaids, and the whole thing indeed highly genteel. But two cheerful women servants appeared from what was presumably the kitchen direction, wheeling a curious wicker erection, which his small guide informed him was called Aunt Clatter--manifestly deservedly--and which bore on its shelves the substance of the meal. And while the maids at this migratory sideboard carved and opened bottles and so forth, the small boy and a slightly larger brother, assisted a little by two young men of no very defined position and relationship, served the company. Mrs. Britling sat {{at the head of the}} table, and conversed with Mr. Direck by means of hostess questions and imperfectly accepted answers while she kept a watchful eye on the proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} when choosing between disposable <b>diapers</b> and <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> is cost. [...] It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained. [...] In contrast, <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> while initially more expensive than disposables, cost as low as $300 for a basic set of <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> although costs can rise with more expensive options. [...] The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered. [...] The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.|$|R

5000|$|... 2012 saw {{explosion}} of <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> [...] "co-ops" [...] {{on the website}} Facebook where groups of people would purchase <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> in bulk from the manufacturer and distribute them to the members.In May 2012 Lalabye Baby launched as a modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapering</b> company. Desiring to combine a love for <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> and a passion for design, Lalabye Baby was created to provide a high quality, safe, eco-friendly diaper at an affordable price. Along with their diapers, they hope to bring an awareness to the alarming amount of waste being produced by disposable diapers.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> {{consisted}} of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with safety pins. Today, most <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> are fastened with hook and loop tape (velcro) or snaps.|$|R
50|$|Also, in 2004 and 2005, {{designer}} diapers {{were the}} rage. Some more sought after brands {{can be sold}} at auction for $200-300.00, with some charity auctions bringing in over $500.00 for <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b> Online forums exploded with <b>cloth</b> <b>diapering</b> communities (MDC taking the lead) and many new web sites dedicated to <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> information. Diaper sewing is a hot pastime and many online resources, patterns, and diaper fabric stores were opened.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> users re-emerged with {{environmental}} issues concerning {{the use of}} disposables. By the late 1990s {{and the beginning of}} the next decade, many large <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> manufacturing companies were well established.|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 and 2005 {{were also}} the host to an {{explosion}} {{of growth in the}} <b>cloth</b> <b>diapering</b> community. Many new <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> sewing and retail businesses were started. The presence of WAHM congos also saw a tremendous amount of growth.|$|R

Many design features of modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, {{such as the use of}} the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> brands use variations of Procter & Gamble's original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in Pampers.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, the {{disposable}} diaper rapidly {{took hold}} and <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> use {{fell out of}} favor. The [...] "Safe Diaper Clip," [...] an alternative to traditional safety pins, was invented and patented in 1961 by Edward Moonan of Boonville, NY. but never took off, due to drop in use of <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... gDiapers {{can also}} be used with a <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> insert, instead of the {{disposable}} insert. The company offers their own reusable cloth insert, though many other options from various sources (including standard infant size prefold diapers) can be used. gDiapers also offers flushable liners called Cloth Liners to lay on top of <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> inserts, facilitating feces disposal.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{variations}} {{in the care of}} <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> that can account for different measures of environmental impact. For example, using a <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries. Yet such a service uses less water per diaper in the laundering process. [...] Some people who launder <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a [...] "prewash", and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering. <b>Cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> are most commonly made of cotton, which is generally considered an environmentally wasteful crop to grow. [...] "Conventional cotton {{is one of the most}} chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of insecticides on 3% of our arable land; that's more than any other crop per unit." [...] This effect can be mitigated by using other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{detectable}} {{difference in}} rates of diaper rash in conventional disposable diaper wearers and reusable <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> wearers. [...] "Babies wearing superabsorbent disposable diapers {{with a central}} gelling material have fewer episodes of diaper dermatitis compared with their counterparts wearing <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b> However, {{keep in mind that}} superabsorbent diapers contain dyes that were suspected to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)." [...] Whether wearing <b>cloth</b> or disposable <b>diapers</b> they should be changed frequently to prevent diaper rash, even if they don't feel wet. To reduce the incidence of diaper rash, disposable diapers have been engineered to pull moisture away from the baby's skin using synthetic non-biodegradable gel. Today, <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> use newly available superabsorbent microfiber cloth placed in a pocket with a layer of light permeable material that contacts the skin. This design serves to pull moisture away from the skin in to the microfiber cloth. This technology is used in most major pocket <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> brands today.|$|R
50|$|Diaper flannel is a stout {{cotton fabric}} napped on both sides, {{and used for}} making <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rags or washcloths are {{sometimes}} used. They are then washed similarly to <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> and used again.|$|R
50|$|This {{laminated}} fabric is {{useful as a}} wind and/or water barrier {{in the construction of}} fluid-splash protecting garments, shower curtains, outerwear clothing, however it is primarily used for making <b>cloth</b> nappies / <b>diapers</b> and <b>cloth</b> menstrual pads. It can be machine-washed and dried.|$|R
25|$|Diapers {{are made}} of cloth or {{synthetic}} disposable materials. <b>Cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA, and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use. Plastic pants can be worn over diapers to avoid leaks, but with modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> {{this is no longer}} necessary.|$|R
50|$|Lanolin {{can also}} be {{restored}} to woolen garments to make them water and dirt repellent, such as for <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> covers.|$|R
5000|$|... 2002 and 2003 {{are also}} known by many {{experienced}} <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> WAHMS as the diaper war years. Larger <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> companies began threatening smaller ones with legal action and accusations of pattern or patent infringement. Motherease threatened legal action {{as they tried}} to protect their pattern for the one size diaper, and Fuzzi Bunz threatened legal action to protect their patent on pocket diapers. Many small WAHM diaper makers closed, deciding that the industry was too cutthroat.|$|R
40|$|In my thesis, I {{have covered}} {{interviews}} with ten women - mothers who {{have decided to}} use for their babies a changing system of modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b> For the topic I have used a qualitative sociological research strategy. The purpose of the received data from the interviews was {{to answer questions about}} motivations and reasons for the usage of this type of nappies and decide what benefits they see in them. As our society is used to disposable baby diapers and looks at them as a norm, I was interested in people's reactions, which these mothers have faced and how they have coped with. Finally, I have tried to find out the role of the internet and the social media in this matter. The theoretical part is devoted to the history of <b>cloth</b> and disposable <b>diapers.</b> There I have put into the context the issue of <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> with the principles of sustainable development and responsible consumption. In the practical part I have carried out an analysis of ten semi-structured interviews with mothers who have been using <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> for babies, along with examples of expressions of activities associated with <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> in social media on the internet...|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, Poochies and HoneyBoy! diapers were {{developed}} and became quite popular, some selling for over $200.00 per <b>diaper.</b> Cuddlebuns <b>Cloth</b> <b>Diapers</b> {{were introduced to}} the diapering community in 1999 and were a one-size diaper that could fit babies from infancy to potty training. All three of these diapers brands eventually became available for the general public to sew through cottage licensing, and are now owned by BabyByYou! Also in 1999, Kissaluvs started an online business to sell fitted and contour diapers. These years also saw a tremendous amount of growth in the amount of moms who begin sewing their own diapers, referred to as [...] "Work at Home Moms" [...] or WAHMs.|$|R
50|$|Touch {{fasteners}} {{held together}} a human heart {{during the first}} artificial heart surgery, and it is used in nuclear power plants and army tanks to hold flashlights to walls. Cars use it to bond headliners, floor mats and speaker covers. It {{is used in the}} home when pleating draperies, holding carpets in place and attaching upholstery. It closes backpacks, briefcases and notebooks, secures pockets, and holds disposable diapers, and <b>diaper</b> covers for <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> on babies. It {{is an integral part of}} the game tag rugby, and is used in surfboard leashes and orthopaedic braces.|$|R
50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers.</b> Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the GroVia Hybrid Diaper was {{introduced}} by The Natural Baby Company. A major component of this modern <b>cloth</b> <b>diapering</b> system, the BioSoaker, was awarded US patent 8115050.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> are {{reusable}} {{and can be}} {{made from}} natural fibers, man-made materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> as a [...] "stay-dry" [...] wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.|$|R
50|$|According to The Diaper-Free Baby by Christine Gross-Loh, EC {{offers a}} wide range of advantages. Because EC lessens families' {{reliance}} on diapers, this helps reduce the environmental impact of discarding disposable <b>diapers</b> and/or washing <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> and saves families hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in disposable diapers. EC babies are free from the problems of conventional diapering such as diaper rash, diaper change battles, not being able to explore diapered parts of their bodies, vulnerability to urinary tract infections, and potentially delayed or difficult potty training. Gross-Loh also reports that EC promotes a unique and wonderful bond between babies and caregivers.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> is a {{reusable}} diaper {{made from}} natural fibers, man-made materials, {{or a combination}} of both.

5000|$|Some sources {{claim that}} diaper rash {{is more common}} with <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers,</b> yet others claim {{that the type of}} diaper makes no difference, but that <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> can speed up the healing process. [...] Others claim the {{material}} of the diaper is relevant insofar as it can wick and keep moisture away from the baby's skin. Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use, barrier creams, mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.|$|R
50|$|Microfiber is {{also used}} for other {{applications}} such as making menstrual pads, <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> inserts, body scrubbers, face mitts, whiteboard cleaners, and various goods that need to absorb water and/or attract small particles.|$|R
50|$|Diaper drives are {{organized}} by diaper banks, other organizations, and individuals to collect diaper donations. Diaper banks also raise funds to purchase diapers and distribute free disposable and <b>cloth</b> <b>diapers</b> to families experiencing diaper need.|$|R
25|$|Another {{factor in}} {{reusable}} <b>cloth</b> <b>diaper</b> impact {{is the ability}} to re-use the diapers for subsequent children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new reusable diapers.|$|R
