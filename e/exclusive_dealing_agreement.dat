[...] "Conditioned rebates essentially buy something the manufacturer wants and the buyer is prepared to give if the price is right." [...] The effect, he says, is equivalent to an <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>agreement,</b> and therefore the same analysis should be used (essentially, the rule of reason).

[...] That outcome (exclusivity) can be achieved without selling below cost. All that a below-cost requirement accomplishes is to show that [...] "the rebates could not be matched by an equally efficient firm," [...] but that should not be decisive.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters in Industrial Economics. Chapter 1 {{is the product of}} joint work with Filippo Balestrieri. In chapter 1 we examine the use of lotteries among horizontal differentiated goods as a mechanism to price discriminate consumers. We use the linear city model to represent a market with two differentiated goods. We show that the optimal selling strategy for a multi product monopolist implies offering at least one lottery with probability 1 / 2. This result is in stark contrast with the the optimal selling strategy of a single product monopolist that attempts to price discriminate consumers based on the probability of delivering the good. Riley and Zeckhauser (1983) show that the single good monopolist does not offer lotteries. We then examine the use of lotteries among the differentiated goods {{in the case of a}} market with two competing firms, each one producing one good. We define two different cases depending on whether the market is fully covered. We call fully covered market the case in which the equilibrium prices of the two firms are such that all consumers buy one good. We show that if the market is fully covered, no lotteries are offered in equilibrium. However, when the market is not fully covered the optimal selling strategy may include offering lotteries. With more than two firms selling differentiated goods, even in a fully covered market, lotteries can be used in equilibrium. In this case, firms might be worse off than in the case where no lotteries are provided. Chapter 2 examines firms optimal pricing policy when they sell a storable good of repeated consumption to time-inconsistent consumers. Consumers with time-inconsistent preferences might struggle to make optimal consumption decisions over time. Sophisticate consumers, aware of their time-inconsistent preferences, often try to limit their consumption of certain goods by strategically rationing the quantities they purchase. (cont.) On the other hand, naive consumers, unaware of their time-inconsistent preferences, may stockpile tempting goods at "home" not realizing that the higher availability of the good might lead them to overconsume the good. It is shown that if consumers are time-consistent, quantity discounts don't increase the firms' profit. In contrast, if firms face naive time-inconsistent consumers, the optimal pricing policy is to use small quantity discounts as a device to increase sales. These consumers take advantage of quantity discount with the intention of saving on future purchases. However, after buying the good they can not resist and overconsume it. We also show that even if consumers are sophisticated, firms still use quantity discounts. Sophisticated time-inconsistent consumers realize that increasing the quantity purchased often leads them to overconsume the good. Hence, they require a significant quantity discount to increase the quantity purchased. Offering a quantity discount leads them to stockpile the good "at home" and hence promotes overconsumption. Chapter 3 analyzes the use of exclusive dealing agreements to prevent the entry of rival firms. An <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>agreement</b> is a contract between a buyer and a seller where the buyer commits to buy a good exclusively from the seller. Exclusive dealing agreements are one of the most common vertical restraints used by firms. Aghion and Bolton (1987) were the first to show that an incumbent seller may want to use <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>agreement</b> that prevents the entry of a rival seller. They argue that an incumbent seller and a buyer sign an exclusive dealing contract in order to extract surplus from a more efficient entrant seller. (cont.) We propose an alternative explanation for the use of exclusive dealing agreements to prevent entry when the buyer is a downstream distributor that also faces the threat of entry. The idea is that the entry of more efficient upstream seller, by decreasing the market power of the upstream firms, makes entry in the downstream market more attractive. This can lead to further entry in the downstream market and to an increase in the competition faced by the downstream firms. Since part of the bigger surplus created by the entry of a more efficient seller is captured by the downstream entrant firms, entry in the upstream market does not necessarily benefits the incumbent downstream firms. by Joao Leao.

5000|$|Section 1 of the Sherman Act {{declared}} illegal [...] "every contract, in {{the form}} of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." [...] Section 2 prohibits monopolies, or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize. Following the enactment in 1890 US court applies these principles to business and markets. Courts applied the Act without consistent economic analysis until 1914, when it was complemented by the Clayton Act which specifically prohibited <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>agreements,</b> particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates, and mergers achieved by purchasing stock. From 1915 onwards the rule of reason analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases. However, the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement. From 1936 to 1972 courts' application of anti-trust law was dominated by the structure-conduct-performance paradigm of the Harvard School. From 1973 to 1991, the enforcement of anti-trust law was based on efficiency explanations as the Chicago School became dominant, and through legal writings such as Judge Robert Bork's book The Antitrust Paradox. Since 1992 game theory has frequently been used in anti-trust cases.|$|R

The main goal of the study is to discover how the transformation from forms-based approach into effects-based approach has reflected on Turkish Competition Authority decisions about predatory pricing, rebates, refusal to supply, margin squeeze and <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>agreements.</b> In the name of these effects, relevant Turkish Competition Authority decisions on the abuse of dominant position in exclusionary practices between 2009 and 2013 have been evaluated under the light of European Union decisions and the Guidance. Consequently, {{it has been argued that}} after 2009, European Union is more consistent to adopt an effect-based approach. On the other hand, Turkish Competition Authority decisions do not show a consistent and clear tendency towards effects-based approach. However, Turkey takes European Union Competition Policy as a model to itself and the publication of The Draft for Guidance on the Assessment of Abusive Exclusionary Conduct by Dominant Undertakings may show Turkey will follow more effects-based approach in the future. In such a case Turkish Competition Authority may be required to evaluate positive and negative sides of the guidance and whether Turkey really needs it...|$|R
5000|$|For {{several decades}} courts drew {{the line between}} {{efficient}} and inefficient exclusion by asking whether the conduct under scrutiny was [...] "competition on the merits." [...] Courts equated such competition on the merits with unilateral conduct such as product improvement, the realization of economies of scale, innovation, and the like. Such conduct was lawful per se, since it constituted the normal operation of economic forces that a free economy should encourage. At the same time, courts condemned as [...] "unlawful exclusion" [...] tying contracts, <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> and other <b>agreements</b> that disadvantaged rivals.

40|$|We {{consider}} the incentives for oligopolistic manufacturers to adopt <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> Manufacturers producing differentiated brands {{can choose to}} distribute through exclusive retail dealerships or nonexclusive dealerships. With nonexclusive dealing, manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> <b>Exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive dealing is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> Moreover, even if adoption of <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{market share}} {{exclusion}} contract between a seller and a buyer prevents rival sellers from competing for {{a share of}} the buyer's purchases. For non-discriminatory contracting we show that, unlike exclusion through <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> market share exclusion can be profitable even when buyers coordinate on the best equilibrium in the contract-acceptance subgame. The condition for the profitability of market share exclusion is characterized in terms of straightforward economic concepts. With discriminatory contracting market share exclusion contracts are generally less profitable than <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> contracts. The motive for employing market share exclusion contracts, which welfare impacts have not been well understood, instead of <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> contracts, which have been the focus of both theory and policy, may thus often be the avoidance of scrutiny by competition authorities rather than some more direct economic advantage of market share exclusion over <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing.</b> However, we also show that market share exclusion decreases both buyer and total surplus. Hence, competition authorities should not view exclusion through <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> as a pre-requisite for the possibility of anti-competitive effects from exclusionary contracting. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. I {{reconcile}} {{a disagreement}} {{in the literature}} regarding the impact of downstream price competition on anticompetitive <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing,</b> and then extend the <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealing</b> literature to accommodate adverse selection. Adverse selection expands the scope of inefficient exclusion, and may also explain policies of partial exclusion, in which an incumbent profits by locking up select retailers even though the entrant’s product is still competitively supplied in equilibrium. I relate my results to recent antitrust cases against Intel. Consider a market entrant facing two key challenges: gaining access to consumers and con-vincing them that it sells a good product. These challenges are particularly dire because the incumbent may curtail the entrant’s access to consumers by offering retailers exclusive contracts, and because the market is afflicted by adverse selection regarding the entrant. I investigate the prospects for this entrant {{and the health of}} the overall market.
