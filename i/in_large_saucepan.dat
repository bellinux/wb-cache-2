40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Disability and Rehabilitation [© Informa Healthcare]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] The aim of the pilot study was to provide information about the design and use of saucepan handles to enable clinicians and designers to specify and provide products that are more appropriate for use by people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objectives were: to evaluate aspects of new handle design for saucepans in terms of their ease of use for people with RA; document hand grip strength and configuration (grip patterns); record relevant anthropometric data to aid the development of new designs and perform an assessment of lifting techniques used in conjunction with perceived optimum handle configuration. Method/Results: Observation and video footage show that subjects continued to use familiar, but damaging, ways of lifting the saucepan even after extensive joint protection training by occupational therapists. Grip strengths recorded using a sphygmomanometer were similar to those found by other studies. The anthropometric measurements taken from the sample group were found to be within available anthropometric surveys of able-bodied people. However, hand length within the sample group with RA was longer than the equivalent in surveys of able-bodied subjects. Conclusions: Subjects preferred the narrower handles with some surface texture to the larger and more rounded tapered handles. <b>Large</b> handled <b>saucepans</b> were found not to be viable due to the constraints of UK cooking hob sizes and existing British Standards relating to saucepan specification...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of {{syndicated}} loan markets in financial market development in 24 European countries. We find credit spreads to be negatively related to market size in small markets and positively related <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets. Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> <b>large</b> versus small financial systems. In small markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. In small markets, they transfer external finance across borders and <b>in</b> <b>large</b> markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks <b>in</b> small versus <b>large</b> markets differ considerably...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of stone collection and stone theft by breeding Chinstrap penguins was measured, and estimations {{made of the}} number of stones per nest <b>in</b> <b>large</b> (> 400 nests) and small subcolonies (< 50 nests) <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> Vapour Col colony on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. Stone availability was significantly higher both inside and outside small subcolonies. Penguins carried stones to the nest at the same rate <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, but stole more intensively <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies. Stones obtained by theft were significantly larger than those collected elsewhere. When stone availability was increased experimentally, individuals of large subcolonies collected more intensively than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, and stole significantly less than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies, and as much as individuals in small subcolonies. The greater theft pressure <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies was accompanied by more aggressive defence by nest owners and by reduced succession stealing. However, the reduced availability of stones on the ground near large subcolonies led to a significantly lower number of stones per nest than in small subcolonies. These results are interpreted {{in the light of the}} geometric effects of breeding group size (perimeter to surface ratio) on stone accessibility. © 1995 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

30|$|The {{location}} also positively moderates {{the relation}} between EO and venture performance. Firms located <b>in</b> the <b>larger</b> city are more innovative, proactive, competitive and autonomous than firms established in regional towns. These are because of high competition <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> city, which encourage firms to innovate {{a new way of}} doing things and technology that helps to produce new products, and to search for new markets. A risk is associated with activities that have good promise to return. As a result, firms <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities are more autonomous and risk takers. In general, firms involved with the manufacturing sector and adopting strong EO tend to perform more than their relatives. Besides, firms located <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities that adopt EO grow much better than enterprises established in regional towns. More specifically, the performance of ventures <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities is better than the ventures in regional towns because of the better practice of EO <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> cities.|$|R
