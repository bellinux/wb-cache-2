5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1920s, the ANAK Society {{involved}} itself {{in a number of}} civil rights activities. In 1921, ANAK spearheaded an effort to prevent the white supremacist <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan from setting up a chapter at Georgia Tech. The effort was successful.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Perry Nussbaum, Beth Israel's rabbi from 1954 to 1973, {{was active}} in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1967 the {{congregation}} moved to a new synagogue building, (its current one), and both the new building and Nussbaum's house were bombed by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan that year.|$|E
5|$|Frankhouser {{had been}} an {{informant}} for the ATF and other law enforcement agencies, {{in addition to being}} a neo-Nazi and a former Pennsylvania <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan grand dragon. Frankhouser became a security consultant for LaRouche after convincing him that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} on 19 November 2014 that Anonymous had declared cyber {{war on the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK) the previous week, after the KKK had made death threats following the Ferguson riots. They hacked the KKK's Twitter account, attacked servers hosting KKK sites, and started to release the personal details of members.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the {{education}} {{building of the}} new complex was bombed {{by members of the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Pieces of glass were salvaged from the destruction and are now incorporated into the front windows of the current synagogue building. The congregation owns and maintains a historic cemetery at 19th Street and 15th Avenue which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Non-war related {{free speech}} rights were also {{advanced}} during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision Brandenburg v. Ohio, which held that only speech which advocated imminent violence could be outlawed.|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in his career, Jackson made a second music video for a single. This second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates; in the video Jackson is seen handcuffed. It also {{contains}} real footage of police attacking African Americans, the military crackdown of the protest in the Tiananmen Square, the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, war crimes, genocide, execution, martial law, and other human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a mixed {{group of}} black and white men play {{baseball}} in Roswell, New Mexico. Suddenly, a group of <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK) members arrive on horseback, seeking one of the players: Josh Exley (Jesse L. Martin), a talented black baseball player. Men from the team fight back against the KKK, and when the mask of the clan's leader is taken off, the leader is revealed to actually be an alien.|$|E
5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began {{to adopt a}} more {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. Charley was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was {{also a member of the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that Charley was a Klansman.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition. During the Reconstruction era, his home was burned to the ground by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield. In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Wesley Evans (September 26, 1881– September 14, 1966) was Imperial Wizard of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan, an American white {{supremacist}} group, from 1922 to 1939. A native of Alabama, Evans attended Vanderbilt University {{and became a}} dentist. He operated a small, moderately successful practice in Texas until 1920, {{when he joined the}} Klan's Dallas chapter. He quickly rose through the ranks and was part of a group that ousted William Joseph Simmons from the position of Imperial Wizard, the national leader, in November 1922. Evans succeeded him and sought to transform the group into a political power.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Price (1965), {{eighteen}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan {{members were}} charged with murder and conspiracy {{for the deaths of}} James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but the charges were dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A. Rainey, were found not guilty; and three of them, including Edgar Ray Killen, had their cases end in a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Alan Parker, and written by Chris Gerolmo. It is {{loosely based on}} the FBI's investigation into the 1964 Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner murder case in Mississippi. The film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents assigned to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi. The investigation is met with hostility and backlash by the town's residents, local police and the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK).|$|E
5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted {{activities of the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. During {{his first year in}} office, he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also {{an active member of the}} Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.|$|E
5|$|TISM {{have used}} a variety of methods to conceal their identities. They have never officially {{revealed}} their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, all the while concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle, fat 'businessman' suits, and eight-foot-high inflatable headpieces among others.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other vices that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was never far from the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with the Klan and its ideals.|$|E
5|$|The {{society has}} been {{influential}} {{in the history of}} Georgia Tech. ANAK {{played a major role in}} establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active student organizations – including its yearbook, the Blueprint; its student newspaper, the Technique; and its Student Government Association – as well as several lasting Georgia Tech traditions. The society also claims involvement in a number of civil rights projects, most notably in peacefully integrating Georgia Tech's first African American students and preventing the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech. These claims have yet to be substantiated by independent sources.|$|E
5|$|After {{tracking}} the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation {{of the wealthy}} Spencer Bennett and killing them, the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz and becomes his apprentice. Later that evening, the duo are hunted by Spencer Bennett and a large gang of white supremacists (a reference to the early <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan), but Dr. Schultz deceives and kills most of Bennett's gang with an explosive and Django kills Bennett. Dr. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and feels morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the flyer for good luck.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan).|$|E
5|$|Grant won the {{election}} by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, {{at the age of}} 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. Grant was the first president to be elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan violence against African American voters.|$|E
5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and one black) who {{organize}} a voter registry for African Americans in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they had become so notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in one incident the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the white caps showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats from members of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section of The Dallas Morning News, as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, the {{production}} moved to LaFayette, Alabama {{for the remainder}} of filming. From April 28 to April 29, Parker and his crew filmed scenes set in Mrs. Pell's home. On May 5, {{the production}} shot one of the film's final scenes, in which Anderson discovers Mrs. Pell's home trashed. On May 13, the crew filmed scenes in a former LaFayette movie theatre, which had now become a tractor tire store. The art department restored the theatre's interiors to reflect the time period. Filming concluded on May 14, 1988 after the production filmed a <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan speech that is overseen by the FBI.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna {{as a witness}} to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time. When Datebook, a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests {{broke out in the}} Southern United States. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan.|$|E
