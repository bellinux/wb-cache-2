5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, {{was taking}} her daughters to the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} to board a train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm</b> from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E

5000|$|The court held, further, {{that the}} concept of a non-delegable or [...] "personal" [...] duty had been {{designed}} to enable a plaintiff to outflank the general rule as stated above. The problem was that the classification in any particular circumstances of a duty as non-delegable amounted to an assertion without rational backing. The correct approach to the liability of a principal for the negligence of an independent contractor was to apply the fundamental rule that obliged everyone to exercise that degree of care that the circumstances demanded. That meant that, given that the first appellant's duty was to take care that the premises were safe, it was obliged to take no more than reasonable steps to guard against <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm</b> to the public.|$|E
50|$|In reintroducing {{the need}} for {{proximity}} as a central control device, it has been stated that these three stages are 'ingredients' of liability, rather than tests in their own right. For example, liability can arise between complete strangers, where positive acts involving <b>foreseeable</b> physical <b>harm</b> occur; where negligent omissions and misstatements occur however, {{it is necessary to}} show a proximate relationship, as well as a foreseeability of harm.|$|R
25|$|Intentional torts are any {{intentional}} {{acts that}} are reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> to cause <b>harm</b> to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property torts involve any intentional {{interference with the}} property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels, and conversion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} judgment {{has been}} critically received by most academics. [...] The minority followed {{the decision of}} the Court of Appeal, finding that in all cases of psychiatric injury the test in establishing a duty of care was whether the kind of damage (psychiatric damage) was foreseeable and not just {{whether or not it was}} <b>foreseeable</b> that <b>harm</b> (of any type) might come to the plaintiff. [...] This is to be judged ex post facto, taking into account what actually happened. When establishing a duty, the plaintiff's unusual susceptibility is of relevance to the question of duty - once it is established that the type of damage (nervous shock) is foreseeable, then the 'eggshell personality' rule comes into operation, and the exact nature and extent of that damage need not have been foreseeable.|$|R
5000|$|Paisley {{was also}} {{the site of an}} {{incident}} that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman allegedly found a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. However, after Donoghue v Stevenson wound through the courts, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other [...] "neighbours" [...] or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm</b> to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern tort law. The case is often called the [...] "Paisley snail." ...|$|E
5000|$|In California, {{the duty}} inquiry {{focuses on the}} general {{category}} of conduct at issue {{and the range of}} <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm</b> it creates, rather than the specific actions or injuries in each case. Appellate lawyer Jeffrey Ehrlich persuaded the California Supreme Court to clarify the central importance of this distinction with its 2011 decision in Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co. which requires [...] "no duty" [...] rulings to be based on categorical public-policy rules that can be applied to a range of cases, without reference to detailed facts. [...] By requiring courts to apply the Rowland factors at this high level of factual generality, the Cabral decision preserved the role of juries in determining whether the defendant breached its duty of care based on the unique circumstances of each case.|$|E
50|$|RACK {{can also}} be {{described}} as a mindset which pays more attention to perhaps unexpected consequences of BDSM play. Its theory revolves around reasoned, ex-ante commitment, including the possible consequences of riskier play. In contrast, SSC revolves around the end results of play, or the ex-post. It tries to minimize any potential harm despite the risks BDSM players might be willing to partake in. Both philosophies aim to minimize <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm,</b> but RACK puts more emphasis on individual commitment to possible risk, beforehand, while SSC tries to minimize total harm foreseeable over the longer term. Thus, RACK adherents stress the value of individual prior consent to even risky fun, while the SSC contingent counters that people often do not choose as freely as they seem, they might behave irrationally at times, and so the consequences of rash individual choice perhaps ought to be mitigated from the start.|$|E

500|$|Peter Kutner, a {{professor}} of law at the University of Oklahoma, argues that there is a significant ambiguity in Goff's judgment. Cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher now have a requirement that the <b>harm</b> was <b>foreseeable,</b> but it was not defined whether or not it was sufficient that it be <b>foreseeable</b> that <b>harm</b> could occur, or that it be foreseeable that the use of land is [...] "non-natural", that the substance be capable of doing [...] "mischief", and all the other requirements of Rylands. He also states that the decision did not explain precisely whether Rylands should be treated as a development within the law of nuisance, or something which sprung from nuisance and retains a separate existence. He interpreted the Cambridge Water Company decision as not being sufficient to completely write out Rylands as a distinct doctrine; this was later done by the House of Lords in Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|R
5000|$|The statute {{has been}} applied by federal {{prosecutors}} in cases of public corruption {{as well as in}} cases in which private individuals breached a fiduciary duty to another. In the former, the courts have been divided {{on the question of whether}} a state law violation is necessary for honest services fraud to have occurred. In the latter, the courts have taken differing approaches to determining whether a private individual has committed honest services fraud—a test based on reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> economic <b>harm</b> and a test based on materiality. The statute, which has been a target of criticism, was given a narrow construction by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Skilling v. United States (2010). In order to avoid finding the statute to be unconstitutionally vague, the Court interpreted the statute to only cover [...] "fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who has not been deceived".|$|R

5000|$|In 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit {{recognized}} {{that there were}} two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed; in United States v. Vinyard, it concluded that the [...] "reasonably foreseeable economic harm" [...] test was superior (because it was based on employee intent and not employer response) and applied that test to the case at hand. The defendant in the case, Michael Vinyard, had been convicted in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering. His brother, James Vinyard, was an employee of the Sunoco Products Corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled resins for their manufacture of plastic bags. The brothers instead created their own brokerage, [...] "Charles Stewart Enterprises," [...] incorporated in the state of Iowa, and misrepresented it to Sunoco as an legitimate, independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at the lowest possible price. They purchased recycled resins from plastic vendors and, marking up the price, sold them to Sunoco, which eventually yielded $2.8 million in profits. The brothers funneled these profits from CSE to themselves through another entity in order to conceal their involvement with CSE on their tax returns. When the brothers were eventually indicted for mail fraud and money laundering, James Vinyard pleaded guilty and testified against his brother. Michael Vinyard appealed, arguing that his conviction of honest services fraud (defrauding Sunoco of the honest services of his brother, their employee) was wrongful because he did not cause harm nor did he intend to cause economic harm to the victim, Sunoco. Upholding his conviction, the court rejected this argument:The reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm</b> test is met whenever, {{at the time of the}} fraud scheme, the employee could foresee that the scheme potentially might be detrimental to the employer's economic well-being. Furthermore, the concept of [...] "economic risk" [...] embraces the idea of risk to future opportunities for savings or profit; the focus on the employer's wellbeing encompasses both the long-term and the short-term health of the business. Whether the risk materializes or not is irrelevant; the point is that the employee has no right to endanger the employer's financial health or jeopardize the employer's long-term prospects through self-dealing. Therefore, so long as the employee could have reasonably foreseen the risk to which he was exposing the employer, the requirements of § 1346 will have been met.|$|E

50|$|The {{method of}} {{determining}} negligence {{is whether the}} defendant could have foreseen harm through his/her actions.

Once the defendant acts in negligence, he/she must take responsibility for all damages that the negligent act incurs.

5000|$|In 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{adopted a}} similar {{interpretation}} in United States v. deVegter.

The district court dismissed the honest services charges for lack of evidence before the trial began; the government appealed. The court agreed with the government that there was sufficient evidence alleged in the indictment for the defendants {{to be charged with}} honest services fraud, because the allegations showed a breach of fiduciary duty and an intent to defraud in such a manner that [...] "reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> economic <b>harm</b> to Fulton County" [...] was a consequence of the scheme.|$|R

40|$|Although {{harassment}} and bullying have always existed, when such behavior is conducted online, the consequences can be uniquely devastating.

Furthermore, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provides Web site sponsors with immunity for content posted by others and no incentive to remove offending content.

40|$|Debates {{concerning}} {{the degree to}} which reproductive technology (and, within this, assisted conception) should be subjected to control generally focus on the appropriate balance to be struck between the views of the majority in a democratic state, the need to ensure adequate protection of those directly involved, the need to ensure public acceptance of specific procedures and research and the freedom of individuals to organize their life as they see fit. While different countries espouse similar commitments to basic human values {{concerning the}} protection of life, human dignity, autonomy, and prevention of discrimination, these have not provided a means by which consensus regarding assisted conception has been achieved. Such differences facilitate ‘reproductive tourism’. This paper discusses the relationship between ‘reproductive tourism’, ‘reproductive autonomy’ and efforts to regulate assisted conception. It concludes that reproductive tourism will continue to thrive but that discussion must take place nationally and internationally to promote assisted conception procedures that avoid <b>foreseeable</b> <b>harm...</b>|$|E

Child maltreatment is also often defined as <b>foreseeable</b> or probable <b>harm</b> or injury to a child's physical, social, emotional, or developmental well-being.
