5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E

When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the forewings to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> the flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, it beats only its forewings while keeping the hindwings completely steady.|$|E
500|$|The novels leave {{open the}} nature and extent of Widmerpool's sexuality, an aspect on which critics have often speculated. Stephen McGregor of the Spectator {{describes}} him as [...] "impotent"; another commentator used the words [...] "sexual incompetent". At school he gets Akworth a fellow-pupil, expelled for sending a presumably compromising note to Peter Templer; afterwards, Jenkins and Stringham discuss Templer's belief that Widmerpool was motivated by sexual jealousy. A few years later, Jenkins recalls how Widmerpool recoiled when touched <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> the arm by Berthe, a French girl encountered during the pair's summer sojourn at La Grenadière, shortly after leaving school.|$|E

500|$|The stylistic device most {{commonly}} found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate [...] "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples {{can be seen in}} Joy in the Morning, Chapter 29: [...] "There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or Psmith, Chapter 7: [...] "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily {{in the middle of a}} thunderstorm interrupted his meditation." [...] Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.|$|E
500|$|... "Underneath It All" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Rolling Stone found its ska sound and Stefani's questioning {{whether or not}} Rossdale is her soulmate tired. LAUNCHcast agreed the beat was one [...] "that Sly & Robbie can do in their sleep" [...] but added that the song [...] "keeps its modern edge thanks to Lady Saw's cooling rap." [...] Kitty Empire writing in NME also gave Lady Saw's toast a positive review, stating that it [...] "does {{an excellent job of}} sexing up all the sugar." [...] Stylus Magazine was pleased with Stefani's performance on the song, stating that [...] "she lets her voice ride <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> top of the melody, pushed along by the gentle steel drums in the background." [...] PopMatters commented that [...] "No Doubt isn't afraid of working with new ideas" [...] but that the dancehall of [...] "Underneath It All" [...] was unsuccessful and sloppy. In its review of The Singles 1992-2003, OMH Media described the song as [...] "an embarrassingly self-conscious reggae pastiche, unimproved by a guest rap from Jamaican dancehall queen Lady Saw." ...|$|E
500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E

500|$|NPR's Ken Tucker {{described}} the album as a [...] "glossy but heartfelt work" [...] and approvingly compared its contrasting philosophy to Nick Lowe's Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection for All the Family, {{both of which}} he described as [...] "will {{put you in a}} holiday mood". Matt Casarino of PopMatters gave the album a generally favorable review, claiming that [...] "Clarkson plays it safe and spends too much time showing off her upper register, but Wrapped in Red is a warm and romantic addition to the Christmas pop Zeitgeist," [...] adding: [...] "Wrapped in Red doesn’t need edge; it’s just dynamic and varied enough to be satisfying, and it’s light-years better than any of the whitewashed Christmas crap Simon Cowell has inflicted on the world". [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave a favorable review, particularly lauding [...] "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering of the Christmas standards as [...] "fairly straight". She added: [...] "She starts <b>gently</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] before belting out the money notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] and hangs by the piano for a torchy “White Christmas." [...] Newsdays music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that [...] "Clarkson handles it all expertly — hitting remarkably high notes on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and swinging jazzily on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Dunn. The new songs make Wrapped in Red a real gift, as the title track and [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and [...] "4 Carats" [...] somehow blends [...] "Stronger" [...] and [...] "Santa Baby". Reviewing for HitFix, Melinda Newman gave the album an [...] "A" [...] rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Greg Kurstin [...] "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore—most notably Spector's A Christmas Gift For You and Andy Williams' Merry Christmas—to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets." [...] Chris Klimek of Slate declared Wrapped in Red as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting it for its vintage sound. He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] and [...] "Underneath the Tree", [...] "have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Jon [...] Caramanica wrote that [...] "Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are [...] "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be." ...|$|E
