5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, but it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any {{substantial amount of}} deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than {{to that of a}} modern warship.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} {{on her first}} headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries. However, the final schedule <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the idea. In the end several more US dates were added and moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{deals with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied {{that the two men}} were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the views of the London bid.|$|E
5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that her parents have stopped {{speaking}} to her because of her career choice. In a statement, her parents disassociated themselves from her actions, saying that her decision to enter the porn industry was born of her residence {{in a foreign country}} which had a different culture than theirs, and that her actions <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> her upbringing. They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E
5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E

5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of the}} composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the order of composition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E

5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
5|$|Historian Robert Poole {{has called}} the Peterloo Massacre one of the {{defining}} moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government {{to crack down on}} reform, with the passing of {{what became known as the}} Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of The Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as being inadequate as it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the scale of the massacre.|$|E

5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
