The second section presents the turning point of the legal framework applicable to CRMOs on the European level, a move initiated by two of the Commission's DGs (Directorates General) : Internal Market and Services (<b>DG</b> Market) and <b>Competition</b> (<b>DG</b> Comp). The third section will examine the current state of collective rights management in the music and visual domains. The chapter ends with the conclusion that the collective rights management system is currently adapting to digitization notwithstanding the interventions by DG Market, especially in the music sector. In fact, the availability of copyrighted works will heavily rely on collective rights management in the future as well - if not more than ever...|$|R

Minutes from the policy and regulation taskforce meeting of April 19, 2007 show that the platform delivered joint platform positions to a range of EC bodies on issues such as the inclusion of CCS in the EU ETS carbon market to the Environment DG, and that it gave input on financial incentives to the DG for Transport and Energy and on state aid to the <b>DG</b> for <b>Competition.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{argue that}} the European {{financial}} market integration cannot be understood without the European Commission's gradual enforcement of supranational competition law for financial services. The conflict over the liberalization of public banks in Germany demonstrates how the Directorate General for <b>Competition</b> (<b>DG</b> COMP) deepened financial market integration through legal proceedings without {{the participation of the}} Council of Ministers. How could DG COMP prevail over the fierce resistance of Germany even though member states never intended for European law to have enough leverage to alter core elements of national financial systems? The article focuses on DG COMP's capacities for strategic action. DG COMP was able to enforce European competition rules for financial services, skilfully combining its legal competences with political strategies. The case illustrates that the regulatory integration of financial services in the EU is much more driven by supranational institutions than assumed by the bulk of the literature...|$|R

40|$|European Union policymakers have in {{principle}} put innovation {{at the heart}} of competitiveness, in particular in the Europe 2020 strategy. But in merger control, assessments of the innovation effects of mergers are inadequate, even though mergers and acquisitions can {{have a significant impact on}} the development of the structure of an industry, and on its capability to innovate. EU merger control rules include scope for assessing the innovation effects of mergers, but in practice, the European Commission's directorate-general for <b>competition</b> (<b>DG</b> COMP) is not ‘walking the talk’. Innovation effects are only assessed when claimed by parties to a merger, and this happens rarely. Where innovation effects have been claimed, they have not been decisive in any case, meaning DG COMP has not considered them important enough to influence its decision. A framework should be put in place that makes the reporting of efficiency-related information by the merging parties mandatory, so that innovation effects can be properly assessed for all mergers. In addition, models can be used to make an assessment of the longer-term innovation effects of a merger, and to help inform decision-making...|$|R

50|$|To {{all these}} challenges, the Commission has {{responded with a}} {{strategy}} to decentralise {{the implementation of the}} Competition rules through the so-called Modernisation Regulation. EU Council Regulation 1/2003 places National Competition Authorities and Member State national courts {{at the heart of the}} enforcement of Arts 101 & 102. Decentralised enforcement has for long been the usual way for other EC rules, Reg 1/2003 finally extended this to Competition Law as well. The Commission still retained an important role in the enforcement mechanism, as the co-ordinating force in the newly created European Competition Network (ECN). This Network, made up of the national bodies plus the Commission, manages the flow of information between NCAs and maintains the coherence and integrity of the system. At the time, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hailed this regulation as one that will 'revolutionise' the enforcement of Arts 101 & 102. Since May 2004, all NCAs and national courts are empowered to fully apply the Competition provisions of the EC Treaty. In its 2005 report, the OECD lauded the modernisation effort as promising, and noted that decentralisation helps to redirect resources so the <b>DG</b> <b>Competition</b> can concentrate on complex, Community-wide investigations. Yet most recent developments shed doubt on the efficacy of the new arrangements. For instance, on 20 December 2006, the Commission publicly backed down from 'unbundling' French (EdF) and German (E.ON) energy giants, facing tough opposition from Member State governments. Another legal battle is currently ongoing over the E.ON-Endesa merger, where the Commission has been trying to enforce the free movement of capital, while Spain firmly protects its perceived national interests. It remains to be seen whether NCAs will be willing to challenge their own national 'champion companies' under EC Competition Law, or whether patriotic feelings prevail.|$|E

40|$|C 3 glomerulopathies (C 3 G) are a {{group of}} severe renal {{diseases}} with distinct patterns of glomerular inflammation and C 3 deposition caused by complement dysregulation. Here we report the identification of a familial C 3 G-associated genomic mutation in the gene complement factor H–related 1 (CFHR 1), which encodes FHR 1. The mutation resulted in the duplication of the N-terminal short consensus repeats (SCRs) that are conserved in FHR 2 and FHR 5. We determined that native FHR 1, FHR 2, and FHR 5 circulate in plasma as homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes, the formation of which is likely mediated by the conserved N-terminal domain. In mutant FHR 1, duplication of the N-terminal domain resulted {{in the formation of}} unusually large multimeric FHR complexes that exhibited increased avidity for the FHR 1 ligands C 3 b, iC 3 b, and C 3 <b>dg</b> and enhanced <b>competition</b> with complement factor H (FH) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies and hemolytic assays.

40|$|Distributed Generation (DG) {{units are}} {{increasingly}} {{installed in the}} power systems. Distribution Companies (DisCo) can opt to purchase the electricity from DG in an energy purchase contract to supply the customer demand and reduce energy loss. This paper proposes a framework for optimal contract pricing of independent dispatchable <b>DG</b> units considering <b>competition</b> among them. While DG units tend to increase their profit from the energy purchase contract, DisCo minimizes the demand supply cost. Multi-leader follower game theory concept is {{used to analyze the}} situation in which competing DG units offer the energy price to DisCo and DisCo determines the DG generation. A bi-level approach is used to formulate the competition in which each DG problem is the upper-level problem and the DisCo problem is considered as the lower-level one. Combining the optimality conditions ofall upper-level problems with the lower level problem results in a multi-DG equilibrium problem formulated as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Using a nonlinear approach, the EPEC problem is reformulated as a single nonlinear optimization model which is simultaneously solved for all independent DG units. The proposed framework was applied to the Modified IEEE 34 -Bus Distribution Test System. Performance and robustness of the proposed framework in determining econo-technically fare DG contract price has been demonstrated through a series of analyses...|$|R
