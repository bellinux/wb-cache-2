It introduces out-of-plane <b>knife-gate</b> microvalves as a novel design concept and a proportional microvalve concept for pressure control applications. The design {{of three different}} actuator-gate configurations and first prototypes are presented. The first valve prototypes feature thermal silicon-aluminum bimorph actuators and the pressure-flow performance per chip area of the demonstrator valve presented is greatly increased using out-of-plane actuation and an out-of-plane orifice. The characterization of the actuators and of the pressure-flow performance is presented. The prototype valve allows for a flow change of Delta Q = 3. 4 standard liters per minute (SLPM) at a pressure change of Delta P = 95 kPa (P-in = 196. 3 kPa, P-out = 101. 3 kPa) on an active chip area of only 2. 3 x 3. 7 mm(2).
