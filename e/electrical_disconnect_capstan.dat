50|$|It {{involves}} three- or four-wheeled electric vehicles, {{somewhat similar}} in overall appearance to a Go-Kart with an aerodynamic body, but powered by {{an electric motor}} and batteries. Electrathon class vehicles are principally defined and constrained by length and width (12 feet long and 4 feet wide or 3.6 m × 1.2 m maximum) and by battery weight and chemistry (73 lb, sealed lead acid). Discharged for one hour, this amounts to just under one kilowatt (1.3 hp). Driver's weight is ballasted to 180 lb for fairness, and the vehicles themselves may weigh from 80 to 150 lb.

50|$|Atlas D {{tests on}} the West Coast hit a series of snags in the {{following}} months as well. Atlas 25D had flown successfully on April 22 from 576B-1, a coffin silo. The next attempt, 23D (May 6) began experiencing abnormal pitch gyrations within 10 seconds of launch. After about 20 seconds, the missile started tumbling out of control upon which the RSO sent the destruct command. This failure was attributed to wiring in the pitch gyro contacting the casing and shorting out the gyro motor. Atlas 74D (July 22) broke up 70 seconds into launch due to {{a failure of the}} pitch gyro either due to an improper motor speed setting or torquing signals. Missile 47D (September 12) lost sustainer thrust due to a leak in the vernier helium supply system. Missile 33D (September 29) failed to stage its booster section when the staging <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnect</b> plug pulled out at T+125 seconds. 81D (October 13) failed when the LOX quick disconnect pressure sensor malfunctioned due to the loss of a heat shield at liftoff, causing the pneumatic system to overpressurize the LOX tank with helium until it ruptured the intermediate bulkhead and destroyed the missile at T+72 seconds.|$|R

5000|$|The plant's {{final years}} under Horsehead {{were marked by}} several major accidents, {{including}} the failure of both units' main turbine-generator bearings during a loss of auxiliary power, the explosion {{of one of the}} plant's two 138,000 volt substations, the rupture of a high pressure auxiliary steam line, several coal pulverizer explosions, and a large electrical explosion resulting from a no-load <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnect</b> mistakenly being opened under full load. Generating capacity of the plant had been reduced to approximately 50% by 2011, due to the company's lack of funding for routine plant outages and maintenance, as well as the low-BTU, high moisture coal which had been used at the facility since 2010. On June 30, 2011, Horsehead announced that operations at the George F. Weaton station would be idled indefinitely, citing the rising costs of producing power at the facility and a new deal to purchase power for its zinc smelting operation from FirstEnergy. [...] Unit 1 and Unit 2 were shut down on September 10, 2011 and September 11, 2011 respectively, and most of the hourly workforce was laid off or transferred on September 14, 2011.

40|$|Twenty LiCoO 2 /Graphite {{cells with}} ages between 0 and 12 years having {{different}} cycling histories but identical chemistry and construction {{were obtained from}} Medtronic Inc. These cells presented {{a unique opportunity to}} learn about aging mechanisms in Li-ion cells. The cells were studied using the ultra-high precision chargers (UHPC) at Dalhousie University, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and differential voltage versus capacity (dV/dQ vs Q) measurements. Even after 12 years of operation at 37 ◦C, the cells still retained 80 % of their initial capacity and their coulombic efficiency was 0. 99985 when measured at C/ 20 and 40 ◦C. The capacity loss of the aged cells could be explained by loss of lithium inventory through growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the negative electrode which led to impedance increase. There is no evidence of any active material loss due to <b>electrical</b> <b>disconnect</b> in these cells suggesting the cells have excellent electrodes. A low upper cutoff voltage (4. 075 V) is crucial to the long lifetime of these cells due to electrolyte oxidation reactions at the positive electrode, revealed by the UHPC experiments. Comparing similar cells that were cycled to either 4. 075 or 4. 175 V showed that those cycled to higher voltages under the same conditions failed significantly sooner. These results suggest that electrolyte additives that reduce electrolyte oxidation at the positive electrode, will prolong the cycle and calendar life of these Li-ion cells...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of Chip on Board (COB) {{structures}} with LSI chips mounted on the substrate has attracted much attention. One of the main technical problems is that the internal <b>electrical</b> wires may <b>disconnect</b> during the heat cycle process due to {{the differences in the}} thermal expansion coefficients between component materials. In order to prevent thermal expansion deformation the wires are encased in resin. Until now, the relationship between the physical properties of the resin and the thermal residual stress in the wires has been seldom reported. In this work, the influence of resin physical properties on the thermal residual stress generated during the heat cycle process was theoretically analyzed via finite element analysis. The results show that the thermal residual stress generated in the wire during the heating process is larger than that during the cooling process. During heating the thermal residual stress was influenced by the storage modulus of the rubbery state (ER) ...|$|R

40|$|An Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) is an <b>electrical</b> {{device that}} <b>disconnects</b> {{protected}} circuit whenever it detects unbalance current between the phase conductor and the neutral conductor. Such an unbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage {{through the body}} of a person who is grounded when accidentally touching the energized part of the circuit. A lethal shock can result from these conditions. ELCB are designed to disconnect this fault fast enough to mitigate the harm caused by such shocks. Currently, there is no Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) with auto re-closer features in the market. The current ELCB that available in the market is a manual type and cannot differentiate between temporary disturbances and permanent faults. It’s means that, if a disturbance or fault occurs on the protected area (house or shop), the protection system will force ELCB to trip. One of the drawbacks of the common ELCB is that, it’s can’t turn on the power supply back to the normal operation condition although only a short disturbance occurs. Such disturbance is lightning strike on the transmission line in the distribution site near to the protected area. To turn the power back to normal operation, consumers need to do that manually. To overcome this problem, Auto Re-closer Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (AR-ELCB) has been developed. This thesis presents the development of AR-ELCB. This device was designed to differentiate between permanent fault and short disturbances (lightning) ...|$|R
40|$|The Orion CSM {{umbilical}} {{retention and}} release mechanism supports and protects {{all of the}} cross-module commodities between the spacecrafts crew and service modules. These commodities include explosive transfer lines, wiring for power and data, and flexible hoses for ground purge and life support systems. The mechanism employs a single separation interface which is retained with pyrotechnically actuated separation bolts and supports roughly two dozen electrical and fluid connectors. When module separation is commanded, either for nominal on-orbit CONOPS or {{in the event of}} an abort, the mechanism must release the separation interface and sever all commodity connections within milliseconds of command receipt. There are a number of unique and novel aspects of the design solution developed by the Orion mechanisms team. The design is highly modular and can easily be adapted to other vehiclesmodules and alternate commodity sets. It will be flight tested during Orions Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT- 1) in 2014, and the Orion team anticipates reuse of the design for all future missions. The design packages fluid, <b>electrical,</b> and ordnance <b>disconnects</b> in a single separation interface. It supports abort separations even in cases where aerodynamic loading prevents the deployment of the umbilical arm. Unlike the Apollo CSM umbilical which was a destructive separation device, the Orion design is resettable and flight units can be tested for separation performance prior to flight. Initial development testing of the mechanisms separation interface resulted in binding failures due to connector misalignments. The separation interface was redesigned with a robust linear guide system, and the connector separation and boom deployment were separated into two discretely sequenced events. These changes addressed the root cause of the binding failure by providing better control of connector alignment. The new design was tuned and validated analytically via Monte Carlo simulation. The analytical validation was followed by a repeat of the initial test suite plus test cases at thermal extremes and test cases with imposed mechanical failures demonstrating fault tolerance. The mechanism was then exposed to the qualification vibration environment. Finally, separation testing was performed at full speed with live ordnance. All tests of the redesigned mechanism resulted in successful separation of the umbilical interface with adequate force margins and timing. The test data showed good agreement with the predictions of the Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation proved invaluable due to the number of variables affecting the separation and the uncertainty associated with each. The simulation allowed for rapid assessment of numerous trades and contingency scenarios, and can be easily reconfigured for varying commodity sets and connector layouts...|$|R
