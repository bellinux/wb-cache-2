5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> indeterministic natural law only, or c) <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> anything, we are not free.|$|E
