30|$|The {{impregnation}} {{of various}} simple phenolic and natural polycyclic compounds into wood was investigated from the viewpoints of vibrational property and <b>dimensional</b> <b>stabilizing</b> effect. When simple phenolic compounds were impregnated, the loss tangent (tan δ) in the longitudinal direction increased linearly with increasing weight gain. Meanwhile, among the natural polycyclic compounds hematoxylin decreased the tan δ drastically by impregnation. It was {{suggested that the}} five hydroxyl groups and the pyran ring oxygen in the hematoxylin molecule contribute to formation of the crosslinkage-type hydrogen bonds between wood components. The rigidity of hematoxylin molecules may also be important. By impregnation of about 10 % catechol, resorcinol, and saligenin, a 40 % level of antiswelling efficiency (ASE) was attained, although a significant <b>dimensional</b> <b>stabilizing</b> effect was not observed after impregnation of natural polycyclic compounds.|$|E

More precisely, given a linear model for age-structured populations with spatial diffusion, we assume the initial distribution to be unknown {{and that we}} have at our disposal an observation locally distributed in both age and space. Using Luenberger observers, we solve the inverse problem of recovering asymp-totically in time the distribution of population. The observer is designed using a finite <b>dimensional</b> <b>stabilizing</b> output injection operator, yielding an effective reconstruction method. Numerical experiments are provided showing the feasibility of the proposed reconstruction method...|$|E

We confirm the earlier prediction that hexagonal phases, both 2 and 3 <b>dimensional,</b> are <b>stabilized</b> by a field, but we significantly refine the phase boundaries, which were previously estimated {{by means of a}} semi-analytical approximation. In particular, our simulations show that the blue phase I [...] blue phase II transition at fixed chirality is largely unaffected by electric field, as observed experimentally.

When the modulus {{of the s}} -wave scattering lengths are comparable to the mixture thickness, two-dimensional scattering events introduce a logarithmic dependence on density in the coupling constants, greatly modifying the density profiles themselves.

So, after fixing a sampling period h> 0, {{and in order to}} take into account the intersampling behaviour of the plant, we apply the lifting technique developed in Bamieh, Dahleh, Pearson: Minimization of the L_∞-Induced Norm for Sampled Data Systems.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between wood, Pinus sylvestris, (60 % RH) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) of different molecular weights (PEG 200 and PEG 1500), pentaerythritol and glycerol, impregnated into the wood, {{has been investigated}} using Scanning Electron Microscopy, EDS-analysis, dynamical mechanical techniques (DMTA), X-ray diffraction (WAXS) and macroscopic dimensional measurement. Reduced dimensional changes after impregnation when exposed to environments with changing moisture content, showed that the stabilization effect of glycerol and PEG 200 impregnation is very good. The other chemicals used, especially pentaerythritol, were not as effective as glycerol and PEG 200. Cell wall measurements using SEM show that an increase in cell wall thickness gives a corresponding increase in stabilization effect. DMTA-measurements showed that {{interaction between}} wood molecules and the chemicals used differs. In general, {{a higher degree of}} cell wall penetration of the chemicals gives a better stabilization effect. WAXS- investigations showed free crystalline pentaerythritol, PEG 1500, glycerol and PEG 200. Examination using SEM/EDS-linescan of potassium stained chemicals confirmed the results from the cell wall thickness measurements. However, the better resolution obtained in the STEM/EDS-linescan showed an inhomogenous distribution of the chemical in the cell wall. High temperature dried and green wood of Swedish pine was impregnated with glycerate and silver nitrate. Silver was precipitated in the cell wall by a new method. A significant difference in the distribution, size and location of the silver was observed. The silver particles are small and dispersed in the green wood samples but clustered and irregulary spaced in the dried specimens. The inhomogenous distribution in the dried specimens {{is believed to be the}} result of damage inside the wood cell walls due to drying stresses, which in turn will negatively affect the <b>dimensional</b> <b>stabilizing</b> result. The strength and energy to fracture is increased by a factor of two if wood not is allowed to be dried before cell wall bulking. This is because the impregnating chemical (glycerol in the present case) in the cell wall substitutes some of the moisture and therefore limits drying stresses. The glycerol is believed to be soluble inbetween the hemicellulose. The average distance between the silver particles in the impregnated green wood indicates that the impregnant is distributed in the cell wall at the microfibrilar level. Experimental results showed that the fastest diffusion path into the cell wall is from the lumen over the pit membrane through the compound middle lamell and not from the lumen through the secondary wall layer S 3. The darker compound middle lamella seen in TEM is believed to be an artefact, as it is possible that the ML is thicker than the other layers in the wood cell wall after microtoming.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the equilibrium properties of boson-fermion mixtures {{consisting of a}} Bose condensate and spin-polarized Fermi gas confined in a harmonic two-dimensional (2 D) trap using mean-field theory. Boson-boson and boson-fermion coupling constants have a logarithmic dependence on the density because of the two-dimensional scattering events when the s-wave scattering lengths are {{on the order of}} mixture thickness.

We find that films thicker than 5 quintuple-layer (QL) exhibit the usual anomalous Hall effect for magnetic TIs. When the thickness {{is reduced to}} 4 QL, however, characteristic features associated with the topological Hall effect (THE) emerge. More surprisingly, the THE vanishes again when the film thickness is further reduced to 3 QL.

40|$|Abstract- In {{manufacturing}} engineering education, {{there is a}} need for problem-solving projects that reflect real issues to supplement or replace drill and practice problems. Authentic activities offer an opportunity to apply new knowledge and skills to {{manufacturing engineering}} problems, test theories, and draw conclusions in a safe environment with the help of peers and mentors. Case studies add relevance and real world context to manufacturing engineering education. At Greenfield Coalition, two case studies were developed on the basis of real issues faced by the Focus:HOPE Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT), a tier-one supplier to the automotive industry. The first involves superficial irregularity-determining why some, but not all, batches of aluminum manifold castings discolor during machining. The second study involves <b>dimensional</b> irregularities- <b>stabilizing</b> bore dimensions for a pulley used in the manufacture of diesel engines. Both studies require student teams to brainstorm potential causes, generate solutions and select the best method for elimination of the problems. The final deliverable for each case is a report similar to one that might be presented to management of a given organization. By employing case studies in manufacturing engineering education, students learn to apply skills and techniques to new situations just as they would have to perform on the job.

This formulation utilizes the stabilized conforming nodal integration, where {{for the purpose}} of stability and efficiency a Lagrangian smoothing strain at nodal point is constructed and thereafter the internal energy is evaluated nodally. This formulation ensures the linear exactness, efficiency and spatial stability in a unified manner and it makes the conventional Galerkin meshfree method affordable for three dimensional simulation. The three <b>dimensional</b> implementation of <b>stabilized</b> conforming nodal integration is discussed in details. To model the failure evolution in soil medium a coupled elasto-plastic damage model is used and an objective stress integration algorithm in combination of elasto-damage predictor and plastic corrector method is employed for stress update.

40|$|Recently we {{proposed}} a TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the gauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in the MSSM, and occurs in the TeV range. One of the key ingredients of this model {{is the presence of}} new states neutral under SU(3) _c⊗ SU(2) _w but charged under U(1) _Y whose mass scale is around that of the electroweak Higgs doublets. In this paper we show that introduction of these states allows to gauge novel anomaly free discrete (as well as continuous) symmetries (similar to "lepton" and "baryon" numbers) which suppress dangerous higher <b>dimensional</b> operators and <b>stabilize</b> proton. Moreover, we argue that these gauge symmetries are essential for successfully generating small neutrino masses via a recently proposed higher dimensional mechanism. Furthermore, the mass hierarchy between the up and down quarks (e. g., t vs. b) can be explained without appealing to large tanβ, and the μ-term for the electroweak Higgs doublets (as well as for the new states) can be generated. We also discuss various phenomenological implications of our model which lead to predictions testable in the present or near future collider experiments. In particular, we point out that signatures of scenarios with high vs. low unification (string) scale might be rather different. This suggest a possibility that the collider experiments may distinguish between these scenarios even without a direct production of heavy Kaluza-Klein or string states.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} the {{increasing}} demand for energy are important challenges of this century. Associated issues such as urban pollution due to automotive applications are also a major concern. To mitigate the impacts of our energy usage, a new mix based on renewable energies, including a substantial contribution from biomass, is required. Biofuels can be produced from biomass via biochemical and thermochemical processes. Valerate esters are synthetized from lignocellulose through hydrolysis, hydrogenation and esterification reactions. These biofuels present similar properties with the traditional fuels such as gasoline and diesel. They can be blended with them or fully substituted. Among these esters, methyl and ethyl valerates {{can be used in}} spark ignition engines thanks to their physicochemical properties. However, the formation of pollutants such as aldehydes (acetaldehyde and formaldehyde) is a disadvantage for its automotive applications. In this work, ethyl valerate, also called “ethyl pentanoate”, is studied. The understanding of its detailed combustion chemistry is crucial to control the pollutant formation. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the flame structure of ethyl valerate at low pressure and for three equivalence ratios. Three premixed, laminar and one <b>dimensional</b> flames are <b>stabilized</b> on a Spalding-Botha burner. Gas chromatography is used to separate and to identify the reactants, the products and the intermediate species produced during this ester combustion. A new kinetic model named “Katshiatshia mechanism” is elaborated, tested and validated using the experimental data. This new detailed kinetic model is also assessed using experimental data of ethyl valerate laminar burning velocities (from Lund University) and using jet-stirred reactor experiments at high pressure (from the Université d’Orléans). The simulation results agree well with the jet-stirred reactor experimental results. For the laminar burning velocities, the kinetic model slightly overestimates the experimental data. The mechanism has to be further improved to extend its reliability at atmospheric and high pressures. (FSA - Sciences de l'ingénieur) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
