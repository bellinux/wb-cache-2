Service on the Central Link light rail line began on July 18, 2009, operating from Westlake station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to Tukwila International Boulevard station near the airport. Light rail service was extended north from Westlake to University of Washington station (via Capitol Hill station) on March 19, 2016, coinciding with the moving of several bus routes {{out of the tunnel}} to accommodate increased train frequencies.|$|E

The Office of Compliance (OOC), {{which is responsible for}} advancing safety, health, and workplace rights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislative branch, and <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> workers had raised concerns about health and safety issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b> As a result of these concerns, in January 2006, OOC issued citations for and asked AOC to address a potential asbestos hazard and heat stress conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b> <b>In</b> addition, in February 2006, OOC filed a complaint against AOC concerning hazards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> including falling concrete, an inadequate communication system for these confined spaces, and inadequate escape exits (egresses). According to OOC officials, these conditions had been brought to AOC's attention by OOC inspectors as early as 1999, but AOC had not made sufficient progress in addressing them, and conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> had deteriorated further. In June 2007, AOC reached a settlement agreement with OOC to resolve both the citations and the complaint.

5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} test whether graft healing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>tunnel</b> was {{inferior}} to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> femoral <b>tunnel</b> after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in rabbits. METHODS: Surgical reconstruction by use of the digital extensor tendon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone <b>tunnel</b> was performed <b>in</b> 18 rabbits. <b>The</b> rabbits were killed at weeks 2, 6, and 12 postoperatively, with 6 at each time point, for histologic examination. RESULTS: The transiently formed cartilaginous interface was gradually mineralized during re-establishment of direct tendon-to-bone integration, which was observed significantly less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>tunnel</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> femoral <b>tunnel</b> (P <. 05). The cell density of the graft was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>tunnel</b> than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> femoral <b>tunnel</b> at weeks 2 and 6 postoperatively (P <. 05 for both). An increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immature type III collagen content {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in graft collagen fiber organization, with healing over time <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> femoral and tibial <b>tunnels.</b> <b>The</b> collagen fiber organization of the graft was significantly poorer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>tunnel</b> than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> femoral <b>tunnel</b> at week 12 after surgery (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Grafted tendon healing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>tunnel</b> was inferior to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> femoral <b>tunnel</b> at <b>the</b> tendon-to-bone interface and with regard to the grafted tendon within <b>the</b> bone <b>tunnel</b> after ACL reconstruction in rabbits. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Future biopsy study is desirable {{to test whether}} this observation was valid clinically, which might provide a scientific basis for therapeutic targets to improve the outcome of ACL surgery. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E

The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout {{and loss of}} ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains.

Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E

5|$|Metro {{awarded a}} $44.1 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Atkinson and Dillingham companies to build the tunnel's 3rd Avenue segment as well as Pioneer Square station. Excavation of the station from street level began in March 1987, and the project's twin tunnel boring machines reached James Street from Union Station in September. In June 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham and Metro were fined $80,000 after drilling at the station severed three electric power transmission lines, causing a day-long power outage in downtown Seattle, affecting the City Hall and Public Safety Building.

5|$|The loop itself still exists, {{although}} it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. Fortunately, the loop had been sealed off years before. In September 1938, during the Sudeten Crisis, when war appeared imminent, the Bakerloo and Northern line tunnels at Embankment were temporarily sealed with concrete to protect against flooding through bombing. The blockage was removed after {{little more than a}} week once the crisis had passed. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the tunnels were blocked again until electrically powered emergency doors could be installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> mouths.
