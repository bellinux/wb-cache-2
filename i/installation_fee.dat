In 1999 Electrolux piloted an use-oriented sustainable “pay-per-wash” {{service in}} Sweden, failing to succeed because of a myopic marketing approach. New energy and water efficient washing machines were distributed by Electrolux among consumers. Electrolux supplied customers with maintenance services through a central database via the Internet and took care of the disposal and upgrading of the machines. Consumers did not pay for the machines themselves; they were only charged with a small <b>installation</b> <b>fee</b> at the beginning, and through a pay-per-wash charging system (10 Swedish kronor (about 1 $) per wash). However, an excessive emphasis on the green component in the marketing of this service, achieved at the expenses of other consumer benefits and values, failed to convince the consumers. According to A. Ottmann et al. not only environmental but also other inherent consumer values should have been better marketed by Electrolux: convenience of pay-per-wash, including easy trade-ins for upgrades, free service and saved money of a new washing machine. In addition, the sustainable service might have been successful if pay-per-wash convenience would have been bundled with more desirable features.|$|E

40|$|Block rate pricing of {{piped water}} in Indonesian cities has a {{progressive}} structure: the marginal price paid increases with {{the volume of}} demand. This paper estimates household water demand in Salatiga city using the Burtless and Hausman model, and finds that its distribution is not unimodal—that data cluster around kinks. The main estimation results are a price elasticity of approximately – 1. 2 and an income elasticity of 0. 05. These elasticities are mutually dependent. The estimated model is used to investigate the social welfare consequences of a shift to uniform pricing. The principal beneficiaries would be large households, which are not necessarily wealthy. While replacing the complex rate structure by a uniform marginal price would have positive effects on average welfare, the equity consequences would be small. To improve equity, water companies could reduce <b>installation</b> <b>fees,</b> giving low-income households access to water connections, or reinvest profits in network expansion to unserviced areas...|$|R
50|$|Stealth {{inflation}} {{is a type}} of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers. The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract. The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional. Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue. A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing <b>fees</b> and <b>installation</b> <b>fees.</b> Another form of stealth {{inflation is}} devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency. The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to share multimedia contents included in existing digital devices and to solve the problems of an increase in <b>installation</b> <b>fees</b> and non-environmentally friendly interiors. This study designed a new digital signal transmitter and receiver using power line transmission and HDMI in order to solve the problems in the existing systems. The transmitter and receiver designed in this study used an AD 9867 BCPZ PLC chip in which the transmission came from digital signals originating in a PC, and the system architecture was configured so that the outputs signals were connected to a TV from the receiver. The experiment was implemented by adding a Video Test Generator, a USBPre external sound card, and Smaart Live 6 for analyzing the characteristics of the configured system. In the video test results, it was verified that communication was actively implemented, and the image quality showed a constant level from the measurement of the captured video. In the case of the sound, it was verified that more than 90 % of the sound signals were normally transmitted and received from the examination of their phases and magnitudes. Thus, the performance of the system designed in this study was verified, which leads to the resolution of some of the problems found in current digital devices.

40|$|Goossen, Keith W. The {{approach}} {{proposed in}} this paper relates {{to the concept of}} solar cell cooling. By tilting the solar cell at an angle to the sun, the heating of the solar cell decreases due to reduced solar irradiance, while the cooling of the solar cell by thermal radiation and convection remains the same, and thus the solar cell will be cooler and more efficient. Of course, with such a tilted deployment, more solar cells have to be used for the same deployment area. Thus, this thesis concerns itself with how to gain the maximum energy from certain amount of deployment area by optimizing the geometry of the PV installation. Changing the incident light angle could possibly increase the electricity created by a certain area of incident light but will increase the number of solar cells required. Crystalline silicon solar cell price has fallen dramatically in the past decades and at the same time, the one-time <b>installation</b> <b>fee</b> of a PV system remains very high. Therefore, as the solar panel price becomes minimal compared to the installation cost, and as most households have limited space for solar installation, it is worth looking into the solar cells deployment that result in the largest electricity generation from a fixed size area used for solar cells placement during one installation. The behavior of solar cells at different tilt angles between the incident light has been theoretically and experimentally studied. Experimental results and simulations suggested a power output gain of at most 3 % can be achieved by deploying the solar cell at a certain angle away from sun light for the modules tested under normal weather condition. In summary, this project has explored an alternative passive cooling method that could possibly increase the PV power output from a fixed area of solar panels placed on a limited space, but is proved to be not very practical.
