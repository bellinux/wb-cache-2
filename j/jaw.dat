5|$|<b>Jaw</b> joint - The dentary (the lower <b>jaw</b> bone, {{which carries}} the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of}} the lower <b>jaw)</b> and quadrate (a small bone {{at the back of the}} upper <b>jaw).</b>|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The <b>jaw</b> in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The <b>jaw</b> of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the <b>jaw</b> freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the <b>jaw</b> opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper <b>jaw,</b> and adductor muscles close the lower <b>jaw.</b> This ability to open and close the <b>jaw</b> allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper <b>jaw)</b> were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper <b>jaw)</b> which had a straight posterior edge. The upper <b>jaw</b> bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower <b>jaw</b> held 22 teeth.|$|E
5000|$|Pharyngeal <b>jaws</b> are a [...] "second set" [...] of <b>jaws</b> {{contained}} within an animal's throat, or pharynx, {{distinct from the}} primary or oral <b>jaws.</b> They {{are believed to have}} originated as modified gill arches, {{in much the same way}} as oral <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pharyngeal <b>jaws</b> are a [...] "second set" [...] of <b>jaws</b> {{contained}} within the pharynx of many species of fish, distinct from the primary (oral) <b>jaws.</b> Pharyngeal <b>jaws</b> have been studied in moray eels where their specific action is noted. When the moray bites prey, it first bites normally with its oral <b>jaws,</b> capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal <b>jaws</b> are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the eel's esophagus, allowing it to be swallowed.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, a low-budget direct-to-video {{movie called}} <b>Jaws</b> in Japan (also called Psycho Shark) was {{released}}. However, only <b>Jaws</b> 2, <b>Jaws</b> 3-D and Jaws: The Revenge were ever officially released by Universal Pictures as sequels to the 1975 Steven Spielberg movie <b>Jaws.</b> <b>Jaws</b> in Japan even reused the same found footage multiple times, and shark footage {{used in the}} film (made in CGI) are mangled versions from other killer shark films.|$|R
5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet <b>jaw</b> attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker <b>jaw</b> muscles being a trade-off {{to allow for the}} widened gape.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the <b>jaw</b> called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the <b>jaw</b> joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the <b>jaw</b> joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|Both Abrictosaurus and Heterodontosaurus {{had very}} large eyes. Underneath the eyes, the jugal bone {{projected}} sideways, a feature {{also present in}} ceratopsians. As in the jaws of most ornithischians, the anterior edge of the premaxilla (a bone {{at the tip of}} the upper <b>jaw)</b> was toothless and probably supported a keratinous beak (rhamphotheca), although heterodontosaurids did have teeth in the posterior section of the premaxilla. A large gap, called a diastema, separated these premaxillary teeth from those of the maxilla (the main upper <b>jaw</b> bone) in many ornithischians, but this diastema was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids. The mandible (lower <b>jaw)</b> was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischians. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower <b>jaw</b> were found on the dentary bone.|$|E
5|$|Gary is {{the only}} {{principal}} cast member from the original film who returned, although Lee Fierro made a brief cameo as Mrs. Kintner (the mother of a boy killed in <b>Jaws),</b> as did Fritzi Jane Courtney, who played Mrs. Taft, one of the Amity town council members in both <b>Jaws</b> and <b>Jaws</b> 2. Cyprian R.

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} have 18 to 28 conical {{teeth on}} each side of each <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their <b>jaw</b> line. The teeth on the lower <b>jaw</b> of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper <b>jaw,</b> so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower <b>jaw</b> of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top <b>jaw</b> making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a <b>jaw</b> joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the <b>jaw</b> for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
50|$|Most {{bony fishes}} have {{two sets of}} <b>jaws</b> made mainly of bone. The primary oral <b>jaws</b> open and close the mouth, and {{a second set of}} {{pharyngeal}} <b>jaws</b> are positioned {{at the back of the}} throat. The oral <b>jaws</b> are used to capture and manipulate prey by biting and crushing. The pharyngeal <b>jaws,</b> so-called because they are positioned within the pharynx, are used to further process the food and move it from the mouth to the stomach.|$|R

5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} <b>jaw</b> that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower <b>jaw</b> also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of {{replacement}} teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper <b>jaw</b> held up to 29 teeth per side, with none {{at the front of}} the <b>jaw,</b> and the lower <b>jaw</b> 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower <b>jaw</b> are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought <b>jaw</b> movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways <b>jaw</b> movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) <b>jaw</b> movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5000|$|Many films {{based on}} man-eating animals, usually aquatic, were {{released}} through the 1970s and 1980s, such as Orca, Grizzly, Mako: The <b>Jaws</b> of Death, Barracuda, Alligator, Day of the Animals, Tintorera, Eaten Alive, and the 1996 Bollywood film Aatank. Spielberg declared Piranha, directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles, [...] "the {{best of the}} <b>Jaws</b> ripoffs". Among the various foreign mockbusters based on <b>Jaws,</b> three came from Italy: Great White, which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries {{as a part of}} the <b>Jaws</b> franchise; Monster Shark, featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000 under the title Devil Fish; and Deep Blood, that blends in a supernatural element. The 1995 thriller film Cruel <b>Jaws</b> even has the alternate title <b>Jaws</b> 5: Cruel <b>Jaws,</b> and the 2009 Japanese horror film Psycho Shark was released in the United States as <b>Jaws</b> in Japan.|$|R
40|$|Recently a few {{reports of}} osteonecrosis of the <b>jaws</b> {{associated}} with a bisphosphonate therapy were published. There seemed to be some clinical commonalities with the old occupational disease "phossy <b>jaws</b> 2 ̆ 7;. We give an historical and medical overview of "phossy <b>jaws</b> 2 ̆ 7;. Because of many industrial changes that old disease has become rare; in Germany there are no cases reported in the years 1998 until 2002 — according to the German Hauptverband der gewerblichen Berufsgenossenschaften. Maybe the old knowledge about phossy <b>jaws</b> is able to clear up some secrets of the new drug-associated phenomenon. First observations of phossy <b>jaws</b> {{date back to the}} years 1839 and 1843, they are seen with workers in match stick factories. The causality between phosphorus and phossy <b>jaws</b> was re-cognized in 1845. Phossy <b>jaws</b> are a consequence of endothelium-damage by elemental phosphorus inhaled when working with it. Especially the <b>jaws</b> are exposed to a number of foreign substances, i. e. bacteria by tooth decay or other circumstances. Thus — decreased blood flow and bacteria lead to an Osteomyelitis, so called phossy <b>jaws...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the <b>jaw</b> muscles; the <b>jaw</b> articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the <b>jaw</b> musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower <b>jaw</b> musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|Known {{material}} of Dermotherium includes {{a handful of}} <b>jaw</b> fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower <b>jaw</b> bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower <b>jaw</b> fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the <b>jaw.</b> In addition, this species is known from two other <b>jaw</b> fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2).

5|$|Olmstead {{was born}} in Sceptre, Saskatchewan, a small village with a {{population}} of less than 200, in southwestern Saskatchewan. In 1944, at the age of 18, he moved to Moose <b>Jaw,</b> Saskatchewan, to play junior hockey. In his first year, Olmstead and the Moose <b>Jaw</b> Canucks challenged for the Memorial Cup, after finishing the playoffs with a 15–1record. They were unsuccessful in the series against the St. Michael's Majors. Olmstead had 10goals and eight assists in the 17playoffgames he played.
