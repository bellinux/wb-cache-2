40|$|This paper {{describes}} the resonant drive technique that {{eliminates the need}} for high voltage integrated circuits (IC) in MEMS drive electronics. Resonant drive also offers a versatile solution for position sense and generates the sense signal using a single drive capacitor. Resonant drive uses the fact that the voltage across the capacitor of a series LC tank can be much higher than the input signal driving the tank. The amplification is maximum at resonance and equal to the quality factor (Q). The tank circuit consists of an external inductor and the MEMS drive capacitor. Since the input signal is amplified through the tank, low voltage electronics can fully implement the <b>drive</b> <b>function.</b> As the actuator gap closes, resonance frequency of the tank decreases. This fiequency shift is used for measuring the position. Resonant drive has been successfully demonstrated using torsional MEMS mirrors that require lOOV for 20 deg-optical rotation.

Here, we investigated the integrity of respiratory control mechanisms in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Whole body plethysmograph in parallel with phrenic nerve activity recordings revealed a lower respiratory rate and minute ventilation during normoxia and a blunting of the hypoxic ventilatory reflex in response to mild levels of hypoxia together with a poor performance on a hypoxic stress test in mdx mice.

40|$|The meiotic {{drive system}} on maize {{abnormal}} chromosome 10 (Ab 10) is contained within a terminal domain of chromatin that extends the long arm of Ab 10 to ∼ 1. 3 {{times the size}} of normal chromosome 10 L. Ab 10 type I (Ab 10 -I) does not recombine with normal chromosome 10 (N 10) over an ∼ 32 -cM terminal region of the long arm. Comparative RFLP mapping demonstrates that multiple independent rearrangements are responsible for the current organization of Ab 10 -I, including a set of nested inversions and at least one long supernumerary segment {{at the end of the}} chromosome. Four major meiotic drive functions, i. e., the recombination effect, smd 3, 180 -bp neocentromere activity, and the distal tip function, all map to the distal supernumerary segment. TR- 1 -mediated neocentromere activity (the fifth known <b>drive</b> <b>function)</b> is nonessential in the type II variant of Ab 10 and maps to a central region that may include a second supernumerary insertion. Both neocentromere activity and the recombination effect behave as dominant gain-of-function mutations, consistent with the view that meiotic drive involves new or alien gene products. These and other data suggest that the Ab 10 meiotic drive system was initially acquired from a related species and that a complex haplotype evolved around it...|$|E

Recognizing that the new technologies, which are the most popular aspect of smartness, can play a fundamental role in the new approach, {{it has been suggested that}} we consider them in an adoptive way rather than in an adjunctive way, as it is commonly intended in the general sense of a smart city. According to this vision, in the first part of the paper, a new concept of smartness is proposed (SmartNESS: Smart New Energy Saving System). This concept is also related to the possibility of identifying some leading urban functions that can play a strategic role in improving urban smartness.

40|$|Selfish genes, such as meiotic drive elements, {{propagate}} {{themselves through}} a population without increasing the fitness of host organisms. X-linked (or Y-linked) meiotic drive elements reduce {{the transmission of}} the Y (X) chromosome and skew progeny and population sex ratios, leading to intense conflict among genomic compartments. Drosophila simulans is unusual in having a least three distinct systems of X chromosome meiotic drive. Here, we characterize naturally occurring genetic variation at the Winters sex-ratio driver (Distorter on the X or Dox), its progenitor gene (Mother of Dox or MDox), and its suppressor gene (Not Much Yang or Nmy), which have been previously mapped and characterized. We survey three North American populations as well as 13 globally distributed strains and present molecular polymorphism data at the three loci. We find that all three genes show signatures of selection in North America, judging from levels of polymorphism and skews in the site-frequency spectrum. These signatures likely result from the biased transmission of the driver and selection on the suppressor {{for the maintenance of}} equal sex ratios. Coalescent modeling indicates that the timing of selection is more recent than the age of the alleles, suggesting that the driver and suppressor are coevolving under an evolutionary “arms race. ” None of the Winters sex-ratio genes are fixed in D. simulans, and at all loci we find ancestral alleles, which lack the gene insertions and exhibit high levels of nucleotide polymorphism compared to the derived alleles. In addition, we find several “null” alleles that have mutations on the derived Dox background, which result in loss of <b>drive</b> <b>function.</b> We discuss the possible causes of the maintenance of presence–absence polymorphism in the Winters sex-ratio genes...|$|E

Efficient PFC operation is achieved by implementing functions for Quasi-Resonant (QR) operation at high-power levels and QR operation with valley skipping at lower power levels. OverCurrent Protection (OCP), OverVoltage Protection (OVP) and demagnetization sensing ensure safe operation under all conditions. The HBC module is a high-voltage controller for a zero-voltage switching LLC resonant converter. It contains a high-voltage level shift circuit and several protection circuits including OCP, open-loop protection, capacitive mode protection and a general purpose latched protection input. The high-voltage chip is fabricated using a proprietary high-voltage Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS power logic process enabling efficient direct start-up from the rectified universal mains voltage. The low-voltage Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) chip is used for accurate, high-speed protection functions and control. TEA 1716 T controlled PFC circuit and resonant converter are very flexible.

The enhancement of existing historical paths as well as the realization of new foot routes constitutes an opportunity for tourist development and territorial renewal. Tourist activity plays a strategic role in the pursuit of these objectives but it has to be the result of a planned design of territorial governance aimed at maximizing the expected benefits and at reducing negative impacts on the system of resources (environmental, physical, social, economic). Tourism is a complex activity that interests different sectors but if well planned it can be a <b>drive</b> <b>function</b> to promote sustainable forms of territorial fruition based on slow mobility.

On the demand-side, the selection can be relied with the characteristics of visitors (age, tourist typologies, trip motivations, etc.). On the supply-side, the selection bases on the path’s peculiarities (length, exposure, feasibility, slope, attractiveness, amenities, etc.). Territorial supply can be also integrated through a system of combined apps that can optimize the conditions of fruition (tracking of visitors along the paths, acting in emergency case; real time rescue; upgrading of supply services, etc.).
