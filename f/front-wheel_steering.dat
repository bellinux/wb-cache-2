40|$|Abstract [...] In this paper, {{the dynamic}} target {{tracking}} of a car-like wheeled robot within a sensor-network environment by an intelligent control is developed. The proposed intelligent control is called fuzzy decentralized sliding-mode grey prediction control (FDSMGPC). For implementing dynamic target tracking, two distributed CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras {{are set up}} to capture the poses of the tracking and target cars, which have the <b>front-wheel</b> for the <b>steering</b> orientation and the rear-wheel for the translation motion. Based on the control authority of these two CCD cameras, a suitable reference command for the proposed controller of the tracking car is planned on a personal computer and then transmitted to the tracking car by a wireless device. The reference command contains the reference steering angle of the front-wheel and the reference velocity of the rear-wheel. Only the information of the upper bound of system knowledge is required to select the suitable scaling factors and the coefficients of sliding surface for the proposed controller. Since the target car is dynamic and the tracking car possesses dynamics, a grey prediction for the pose of the target car is employed to plan an effective reference command. Finally, a sequence of experiments confirms {{the usefulness of the}} proposed control system...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{versatile}} small German military vehicles, the Kettenkrad, a blend of tractor and motorcycle, was powered with a 1.4 L Olympia four-cylinder engine. Produced by NSU, it had motorcycle-type <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> for gentle turns and negotiated tight corners with brakes on the propelling caterpillar tracks. The Kettenkrad towed antitank guns and transported troops and signal gear in several theaters of war. NSU continued to make it after the war for use in mines and forests. It {{was one of the}} few vehicles that could do jobs formerly performed by horses for which, owing to the shortage of oats, even less fuel was available than for motor vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.These designs, such as the Python Lowracer, a recumbent, usually have very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and positive or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E
5000|$|One early design, predating 1869 was the Andrews Quadracycle, {{built by}} Andrews of Dublin, Ireland. It {{was made from}} one inch-square iron and was {{propelled}} with foot levers that moved in a long horizontal ellipse. The Sawyer Quadricycle was introduced in 1855 and featured lighter construction, wooden wheels, iron tires and <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> via a tiller. Like the Andrews Quadracycle it was moved by foot levers driving the rear axle. Starley's Coventry Rotary Quadracycle was introduced in 1885 and used conventional bicycle-style rotary pedals instead of foot levers for drive. It was developed from Starley's Coventry Rotary Tricycle design and featured tandem seating for two. The Rudge Quadracycle of 1888 is described as the first modern practical four-wheeler. It had much lighter construction than earlier models, seated three riders in tandem and was steered by levers from the front seat.|$|E
50|$|John Isaac Thornycroft, {{the naval}} engineer, also formed the Thornycroft Steam Carriage and Van Company which built its first steam van in 1896. This was {{exhibited}} at The Great Exhibition, and could {{carry a load}} of 1 ton. It was fitted with a Thornycroft marine launch-type boiler (Thornycroft announced a new boiler designed for their steam carriages in October 1897). The engine was a twin-cylinder compound engine arranged so that high-pressure steam could be admitted to the low-pressure cylinder to give extra power for hill-climbing. A {{modified version of the}} steam wagon with a 6-cubic-yard tipper body was developed for Chiswick council in 1896 and went into service as a very early self-propelled dust-cart. While the original 1896 wagon had front-wheel drive with rear-wheel steering, the tipper dust-cart had rear-wheel drive and <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The Thornycroft tipper was built by the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company, though engined by Thornycroft.|$|E
5000|$|The 666, {{like the}} corresonding {{medium-sized}} Fiat 626, was produced from 1940 as [...] "Unified" [...] truck: since 1937, by law, the War Department required all manufacturers of civilian trucks to have standard features regarding weight, number of axles, speed and capacity, {{in order to}} simplify logistics in case of requisition by the armed forces.The 626 and the 666, which replaced on assembly lines, respectively, the Fiat 621 and Fiat 632, were the first trucks of the Turin with forward control, and with the engine totally contained inside the cabin.The chassis was made of longitudinal members on two axels, with <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and twin rear-wheel drive, a wheelbase and track width of 3.85 meters by 1.84 meters. The truck had a Fiat 366, 6-cylinder 9365 cc, diesel engine, which developed 105 hp at 2000 rpm and was characterized by the innovative layout of guides that allowed a quick and simple replacement from the front. The gearbox had 4 forward speeds and one reverse with reduction gearing. Externally, it differed from the Fiat 626 only in size, the shape of the windscreen and the body. The trailers, with 6260 kg capacity (twice the 626), could carry 20 equipped soldiers.The vehicle was produced from 1940 to 1945 in civil and NM (Nafta Military) 666N diesel versions (nafta) for the armed forces. In 1943, the BM version gasoline was approved for military use, but the armistice prevented production.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} the parallel parking problem of automatic <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles. The problem of stabilizing the vehicle at desired position and orientation {{is seen as}} an extension of the tracking problem. A saturated control is proposed which achieves quick steering of the system near the desired position of the parking spot with desired orientation and can be successfully used in solving parking problems. In addition, in order to obtain larger area of the starting positions of the vehicle with respect to the parking spot for the first reverse maneuver of the parallel parking, an approach of using saturated control with two different levels of saturation is proposed. The vehicle can be automatically parked by using one or multiple maneuvers, depending on the size of the parking spot.

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzes}} {{front wheels}} steering (FWS) vehicles using results obtained from two unmanned cars: Unmanned Car I (UCI) and Unmanned Car II (UCII). The vehicle model integrates the lane angle {{derived from the}} translational system such that data on the lateral position, the lateral velocity and the lateral acceleration are comprehensively obtained. The main function of each block in the two newly developed structures is described as follows. Two angle controllers were used to eliminate the redundant components of the <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angles. A lane scheduled gain (LSG) in each system was used to improve the lane angle deflection in UCI and UCII while the feed-forward controller simulates {{the behavior of a}} driver. The use of an empirical pre-filter reduces the lane angle error for UCI and UCII hence enhancing the performance of the system.

40|$|Narrow tilting {{vehicles}} {{offer an}} opportunity to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, a low weight and a small frontal area. Their narrow track requires that they tilt into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated tilt control system. Automated tilt control systems can be classed as steering tilt control in which active control of the <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle is used to maintain stability, direct tilt control in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and non-tilting part(s), or a combination of the two, namely steering–direct tilt control. Combined steering–direct tilt control systems have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike steering tilt control systems, they are effective at low speeds while offering superior transient roll stability to direct tilt control systems. This paper details the implementation of a steering direct tilt control system on a prototype narrow tilting vehicle and presents experimental results which demonstrate a 36 % reduction in load transfer from the inside wheel to the outside wheel during a ramp-steering manoeuvre when compared with a direct tilt control system...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} control design method for a driver {{assistance}} system. In {{the operation of}} the system, a predefined trajectory required by the driver with a steering command is followed. During manoeuvres the control system generates differential brake moment and the auxiliary <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> angle and changes the camber angles of the wheels in order to improve the tracking of the road trajectory. The performance specifications are guaranteed by the local controllers, i. e. the brake, the steering, and the suspension systems, while the coordination of these components is provided by the supervisor. The advantage of this architecture is that local controllers are designed independently, which is ensured {{by the fact that the}} monitoring signals are taken into consideration in the formalisation of their performance specifications. The fault-tolerant control can be achieved by incorporating the detected fault signals in their performance specifications. The control system also uses a driver model, with which the reference signal can be generated. In the control design, the parameter-dependent linear parameter-varyingmethod, which meets the performance specifications, is used. The operation of the control system is illustrated through different normal and emergency vehicle manoeuvres with a high-accuracy simulation software. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|E
40|$|In {{the terms}} of {{precision}} farming system, this research {{was carried out in}} order to develop a trajectory path control method for the autonomous tractor when approaching a target. Firstly, open loop control was considered to design a trajectory control algorithm directly, definitely and simply structure. A proposed trajectory control algorithm called parallel parking theory was developed as non-linear state equation within non-holonomic constraint. To stabilize non-linear controlled, the algorithm was derived using the state feedback linerization technique. The vehicle posture can be expressed into position, direction angle and steering angle. In a <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicle, two controlling inputs, running speed and steering vehicle, two controlling inputs, running speed and steering angle. Due to the running speed is difficult to control accurately, thus only the steering angle was controlled. In order to achieve the research objective, research work was carried out to compare the performance developed control algorithm between feedback and open-loop control system. A twenty-nine Ps computer-controlled tractor with four-wheel steering and four-wheel drive was used in this research ecperiment. For local based positioning method, fan beam laser sensor,fiber optic gyro sensor and incremental type rotary encoder were installed properly on the vehicle.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that an armored vehicle will lose its directional stability when firing a large-caliber gun while moving. The instability {{is caused by the}} impulse force from firing, acting {{at the center of a}} weapons platform that produces a yaw moment at the center of gravity of the armored vehicle. In order to improve the stability, this paper introduces a firing- on-the-move technology for armored vehicles using an active <b>front-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (AFS) system. The AFS system is proposed to maintain the directional stability of the armored vehicle by providing an electronically controlled correction to the steering mechanism. The steering correction is designed to reject the unwanted yaw motion and bring the vehicle back to its intended direction of travel after firing. The proposed control strategy of the AFS system in this study consists of yaw rate feedback with lateral force rejection control. The AFS system controller is developed on a validated 10 -degrees-of-freedom armored vehicle. The results indicate that the developed control strategy can effectively maintain the directional stability, in terms of yaw and lateral motions, of the armored vehicle after firing. The superiority of the proposed AFS system controller is also evaluated by comparing its performance to an AFS system without lateral force rejection control as well as to a conventional armored vehicle without AFS...|$|E

To simplify the computation of optimal avoidance trajectories, analytical solutions to the optimal planning problem are presented for a point mass subject to an acceleration magnitude constraint, which is analogous to a tire friction circle constraint. The optimal point mass solutions are extended to a nonlinear bicycle model by defining a flatness-based trajectory tracking controller using tire force control. This controller decouples the bicycle dynamics into a point mass at the front center of oscillation with an additional degree of freedom related to the vehicle yaw dynamics. Structure is identified in the yaw dynamics and is exploited to characterize stability limits. Simulation results verify the stability properties of the yaw dynamics. These results were applied to a semi-autonomous driver assistance system and demonstrated experimentally on a full-sized passenger vehicle. Efficient computation of point mass avoidance maneuvers was used as a cost-to-go for real-time numerical optimization of trajectories for a bicycle model. The experimental system switches control authority between the driver and an automatic avoidance controller so that the driver retains control authority in benign situations, and the automatic controller avoids hazards automatically in hazardous situations. by Steven C.
