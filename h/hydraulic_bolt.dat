50|$|A {{tensioner}} is {{a device}} that applies a force to create or maintain tension. The force may be applied parallel to, {{as in the case}} of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bolt</b> tensioner, or perpendicular to, {{as in the case of}} a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner, the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket, which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or compressing a spring, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bolt</b> tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable tensioner.|$|E

In {{order to keep}} the reused roadway stable in its service life, numerical simulation, theoretical analysis and field observation were applied to investigate the deformation rule and failure mechanism of surrounding rock during mining period. Research results show that low strength and high stress difference environment is a fundamental reason of shear failure, different loading and unloading path in both ribs of roadway is the primary reason of asymmetric failure, and performance of bolting support is critical for the roadway stability. Therefore, control techniques of reused roadway are put forward that 1) high-strength and yielding bolts support the roof and ribs to adjust to massive convergence of roadway; 2) yielding counter-pulled cables reinforce small-pillar rib to strengthen the stability of samll coal pillar; and 3) <b>hydraulic</b> expansion <b>bolts</b> support the floor.

40|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{were developed}} long time (let’s remember that Archimedes – 287 - 212 BC – invented the water screw). Nowadays, bolted joints {{are used in}} almost all sectors of the industry. But in spite of having been an important machine part for centuries, problems may be encountered with them. They are so common that they are taken for granted and too often, not analyzed as deeply as it should be. The wrong tightening {{is one of the}} most frequent causes of ductile rupture and by far the most frequent cause of fatigue failure. The tightening operation is never easy. It is necessary to pay particular attention to the choice of the tightening tool, the process and the control method. The tightening operation may itself cause damage on parts. The tightening load must not be too low, or excessive or not equally distributed among the bolts. These three defects can even be made on the same bolted joint! This impacts badly the performance of the assembly and leads to a shorter lifespan. If insufficient precautions are taken, the real tightening preload on all the bolts will not fit well with the requirements and would be badly distributed. Consequently, the practical conditions are quite different from the hypothesizes which are taken for the initial calculations (analytics or FEM) at the design stage. Thus, the results of the calculations of bolted joints cannot be considered as accurate and reliable. Practically, there are several means to tighten a bolt. The two ways most frequently used are torque wrench and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bolt</b> tensioner. Torque wrench involves exerting a torque to the bolt head or the nut. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>bolt</b> tensioner applies a traction load directly on the bolt. It is well known that bolt tensioners give better accuracy and homogeneity in the final tightening load than the torque method, but the tension load applied with the tensioner must be higher than the final remaining tightening load. So, the paper focusses on the hydraulic tensioner to show how the tightening load can be obtained from the applied tension load and to propose a way to optimize and secure the tightening process. However, for the reasons above mentioned it appears necessary to first make a general description of technical aspects of bolted joints. What really happens when tightening with torque wrench or with bolt tensioner is explained...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and <b>bolts.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} focused on an {{evaluation}} of a preload lost in a tappered joint. The analyzed bolts are preloaded by a hydraulic tensioner. When the tensioner is removed, the joint is established and the preload in bolt is decreased. The analysisis carried out on axisymmetry model of joint in ANSYS Workbench 15, a finite element method is implemented in that software. The evaluation of the preload lost is made for a used range of ratio of clamped length to a nominal diameter of bolt. Geometry and material assumptions are defined. Before preloading of bolts to a desired value the process of stabilization preloading must be done otherwise outlines of the analysis are not applicable. On {{the base of the}} outlines of the analysis, the method for analytical computing of the desired pretension is done. The method involves the preload lost, which occurs due to establishment of the joint. The strength assesment of the <b>hydraulic</b> tensioner for <b>bolts</b> M 72 x 4 is done.

Small segmental portion of circumference of cylindrical sections was considered as width of composite laminate and of metallic plates, necessary to accommodate 5 rows of fasteners in transverse direction with specified pitch distance. Bolted radial joints between carbon epoxy helical wound flat laminate and 15 CDV 6 steel plates were realized with 8 numbers of steel fasteners distributed in 3 longitudinal and 5 transverse rows at each joint. Helical angle of winding, length and thickness of carbon epoxy laminate was ± 22. 5 °, 458 mm and 11 mm respectively. Length and structural thickness of radial joints, total length and width of assembly test specimen were 98 mm, 18 mm, 870 mm and 169. 43 mm respectively.
