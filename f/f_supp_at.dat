5000|$|ANH-USA was {{the lead}} {{plaintiff}} in a 2010 lawsuit against the FDA for denying further health claims and constructively suppressing other health claims by attaching disclaimers that effectively negated the preceding claim. The court found that [...] "the FDA’s decision to ban plaintiffs’ colon and digestive tract claim {{because there is no}} credible evidence in support of it 'is unreasonable because it is not supported by a review of the available evidence or the FDA’s own Guidance Report.' See Whitaker, 248 <b>F.</b> <b>Supp.</b> 2d <b>at</b> 13. Indeed, it appears that credible evidence (e.g., the Peters, Ghadrian, Criqui, and Willet studies) does support this claim.

This screening was said to be discriminatory against disabled people. Also, from that court case there was only a “nexus between the challenged service and the premises of the public accommodation.” The court had found that Southwest's website was not a physical public accommodation or applicable to concrete space [...] (227 <b>F.</b> <b>Supp.</b> 2d <b>at</b> 1321) and hence plaintiffs could not demonstrate a “specific, physical, concrete space.” The court reasoned that the Internet is a “unique medium” that had a [...] "nexus between challenged service and physical accommodations. For geographic location, the District court utilised the decision from the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU (521 U.S. 844 (1997)), where its medium had no unique location geographically and is available for everyone across the globe. Thus, the website for the airplane company is not based on a geographical location and hence no nexus for places of public accommodation.

The Department of Justice appealed her decision and requested a stay of her injunction, which Phillips denied but which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted on October 20and stayed pending appeal on November 1. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to overrule the stay.District Court neither anticipated questions ofconstitutional law nor formulated a rule broader than is required by the facts. Theconstitutional issues regarding DADT are well-defined, and the District Courtfocused specifically on the relevant inquiry of whether the statute impermissiblyinfringed upon substantive due process rights with regard to a protected area ofindividual liberty.
