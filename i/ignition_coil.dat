25|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates contact breaker points, which interrupt the current to an induction coil (known as the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{primary winding}} is {{connected}} to the battery (usually through a current-limiting ballast resistor). Inside the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> one end of each winding {{is connected to}}gether. This common point is taken to the capacitor/contact breaker junction. The other, high voltage, end of the secondary {{is connected to the}} distributor's rotor.|$|E
25|$|Some designs {{using an}} EMS retain the {{original}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coil,</b> distributor and high-tension leads found on cars throughout history. Other systems dispense with the distributor altogether and have individual coils mounted directly atop each spark plug. This removes {{the need for}} both distributor and high-tension leads, which reduces maintenance and increases long-term reliability.|$|E

25|$|With the {{universal}} adoption of electrical starting for automobiles, {{and the availability}} of a large battery to provide a constant source of electricity, magneto systems were abandoned for systems which interrupted current at battery voltage, using an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to step the voltage up {{to the needs of the}} ignition, and a distributor to route the ensuing pulse to the correct spark plug at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of two transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary. The ignition coil's secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E

2500|$|An {{improved}} {{ignition system}} {{was developed by}} the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co. (Delco) and introduced in the 1910 Cadillac. This ignition was developed by Charles Kettering and was a wonder in its day. It consisted of a single <b>ignition</b> <b>coil,</b> points (the switch), a capacitor (to prevent the points from arcing at break) and a distributor (to direct the spark from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the correct cylinder).|$|E
2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor. The distributor contains a rotating cam driven by the engine's drive, a set of breaker points, a condenser, a rotor and a distributor cap.

2500|$|Many modern magneto systems (except {{for small}} engines) have removed the second (high voltage) coil from the magneto itself {{and placed it}} in an {{external}} coil assembly similar to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> described below. [...] In this development, the induced current in the coil in the magneto also flows through the primary of the external coil, generating a high voltage in the secondary as a result. [...] Such a system is referred to as an 'energy transfer system'. [...] Energy transfer systems provide the ultimate in ignition reliability.|$|E
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this mode}} of operation, the coil would [...] "buzz" [...] continuously, {{producing}} a constant train of sparks. The entire apparatus {{was known as the}} 'Model T spark coil' (in contrast to the modern <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> which is only the actual coil component of the system). Long after the demise of the Model T as transportation they remained a popular self-contained source of high voltage for electrical home experimenters, appearing in articles in magazines such as Popular Mechanics and projects for school science fairs as late as the early 1960s. In the UK these devices were commonly known as trembler coils and were popular in cars pre-1910, and also in commercial vehicles with large engines until around 1925 to ease starting.|$|E
2500|$|The Milan site {{is located}} at 147 Wabash Street in Milan, Michigan. Ford {{purchased}} an existing mill in Milan in 1936. [...] The mill was renovated, including {{the construction of a}} new dam and hydroelectric plant. [...] The mill was used to process soybeans, and a small factory located on site was used to manufacture <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b> [...] By 1939, the mill had nearly 200 employees and produced all the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> used by the Ford Motor Company. [...] The plant continued to make <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> through World War II, but was closed in 1948, with the production line and its employees moved to the nearby Ypsilanti plant. [...] The property was turned over to the village of Milan, who used it for offices, the police department, and a library.|$|R

50|$|During the Vietnam War the {{original}} AC-130A Spectre gunships and the A-6C Intruder employed the Pave Mace / Black Crow magnetic anomaly detection system to detect truck <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> in vehicles hidden under heavy jungle canopies. When the electric current flowing {{through such a}} coil changes, it produces a magnetic flux, which {{is a change in}} the magnetic field over a given area. When the trucks were running, the current flowing through the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> produced a large and easily detectable flux.|$|R
2500|$|The spark {{generation}} {{story is a}} little more complicated. The purpose of the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> is to make a spark that jumps the spark plug's gap, which might be [...] (it also has to jump the rotor-to-distributor-post gap). At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. Something must be done to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the spark plug. The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|E
2500|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. [...] Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power. [...] The assignment of the letters C, D, F and T is known from contemporary sources. The one type known to have pre-dated the C has been assigned the letter A by a later historian, a notation followed here. [...] The last engine is usually known as the 1914 100hp E.N.V. [...] The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. [...] There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. [...] They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V for inlet manifolds and valvegear. [...] All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} lost wax process. [...] The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with black lead to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. [...] Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. [...] There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> and distributor for dual ignition.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> (also {{called a}} spark coil) is an {{induction}} coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> A modern passenger automobile may use one <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|E
50|$|A useful feature was an 'emergency starting' key {{position}} for {{times when the}} battery was flat to connect the alternator current directly to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
50|$|A dual {{ignition}} system will typically provide that each cylinder has twin spark plugs, {{and that the}} engine will {{have at least two}} ignition circuits, such as duplicate magnetos or <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> {{high voltage}} output is {{connected}} to the rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil’s</b> magnetic field.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> has an open magnetic circuit — the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor, known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|E
