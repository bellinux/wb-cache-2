Evaluating the traffic impacts of work zones is vital for any transportation agency for planning and scheduling work activity. Traffic impacts can be accurately estimated using microscopic simulation models due to their ability to simulate individual vehicles and their interactions that can have a strong impact on various performance measures such as capacity, queue length, and travel delays. One challenge in using these simulation models is obtaining the desired work <b>zone</b> <b>capacity</b> values which tend to vary from one state to another. Thus, the default parameter values in the model which are suitable for normal traffic conditions are unsuitable for work zone conditions let alone for conditions specific to particular states. A few studies have been conducted on parameter selection to obtain the desired capacity values. However, none of these studies have provided a convenient look-up table (or a chart) for the parameter values that will replicate the <b>field</b> observed <b>capacities.</b> Without such provision it has not been possible for state agencies to utilize many of the research recommendations. This research provides the practitioner a simple method for choosing appropriate values of driving behavior parameters in the VISSIM micro-simulation model to match the desired <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> for work <b>zones</b> operating in a typical early merge system...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{the soil}} water {{reservoir}} is critical for understanding the interactions between crops and their environment and the impacts of land use and environmental changes on the hydrology of agricultural catchments especially in tropical context. Recent {{studies have shown that}} inversion of crop models is a powerful tool for retrieving information on root zone properties. Increasing availability of remotely sensed soil and vegetation observations makes it well suited for large scale applications. The potential of this methodology has however never been properly evaluated on extensive experimental datasets and previous studies suggested that the quality of estimation of soil hydraulic properties may vary depending on agro-environmental situations. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate this approach on an extensive field experiment. The dataset covered four crops (sunflower, sorghum, turmeric, maize) grown on different soils and several years in South India. The components of AWC (available water capacity) namely soil water content at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> and wilting point, and soil depth of two layered soils were estimated by inversion of the crop model STICS with the GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) approach using observations of surface soil moisture (SSM; typically from 0 to 10 cm deep) and leaf area index (LAI), which are attainable from radar remote sensing in tropical regions with frequent cloudy conditions. The results showed that the quality of parameter estimation largely depends on the hydric regime and its interaction with crop type. A mean relative absolute error of 5 % for <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> of surface layer, 10 % for <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> of root <b>zone,</b> 15 % for wilting point of surface layer and root zone, and 20 % for soil depth can be obtained in favorable conditions. A few observations of SSM (during wet and dry soil moisture periods) and LAI (within water stress periods) were sufficient to significantly improve the estimation of AWC components. These results show the potential of crop model inversion for estimating the AWC components of two-layered soils and may guide the sampling of representative years and fields to use this technique for mapping soil properties that are relevant for distributed hydrological modelling.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to assess water and soil salinity evolution in the irrigated area of Kalâat El Andalous. Soil salinity, crops yield, water table level and drainage water flow were monitored during the period May 2008 -June 2010. The results showed that during irrigation season (May-September 2008), the supplied water amounts for drip irrigated crops (tomato, melon and squash) were higher than crop water requirements. In fact, the soil water content was always equal or higher than the <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> Average root <b>zone</b> (0 - 60 cm) electrical conductivity of the saturated past extract (ECe) was 2. 3 dS m - 1, 2. 8 dS m - 1 and 3. 0 dS m - 1 in May 2008, May 2009 and May 2010 respectively. But at the irrigation season end, higher electrical conductivity (8. 4 dS m - 1) was recorded in the upper layer (0 - 30 cm). Along rainfall season, a soil salinity decrease was recorded in fact the average electrical conductivity reached 2. 0 dS m - 1. In order to reduce soil salinization (due to accumulated salts during irrigation season), farmers use crop rotation including rain fed crops and bare soil. Allover irrigation season, the highest drainage discharge (192 l/h) was recorded on July 2008 when the maximum irrigation water amount was diverted. Water table level shows a sustained rise when irrigation is relatively frequent during summer.  </p...|$|R

The treatments of the experiment were two priming methods viz., i) Hydropriming, ii) Non-priming and four moisture regimes viz., i) Wet condition, ii) <b>Field</b> <b>capacity,</b> iii) 75 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> and iv) 50 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> Results showed that yield and yield contributing characters (plant population/m 2, number of cobs/m 2, length of cob, diameter of cob, 100 -grain weight) were influenced significantly by hydropriming. Yield and yield contributing characters were highest when hydroprimed seeds were sown at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> whereas it was the lowest at 75 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> from non- primed seeds.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present a new method for <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> estimations using the CPV function (changes in pore volume). The method requires water retention data of an aggregated soil before and after a compaction event. The CPV function estimates the threshold of equivalent pore diameter (D-threshold) between structural and textural porosity using changes in the water retention curve. The D-threshold corresponds to a water potential associated with <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> according to the TFC concept (textural <b>field</b> <b>capacity),</b> which assumes that (i) the textural pores define the <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> conditions and (ii) the D-threshold and consequently the water potential at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> are constant parameters for each soil regardless of its compaction state. Published datasets for different aggregated soils subjected to different compaction processes and data from a lysimeter drainage experiment were used to evaluate the method. The analysis of the drainage experiment was supported by the BUDGETv. 6. 2 model, which was used to estimate the optimum value of the water content at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> (parameter of the model) using observed soil water contents and drainage rates during the drainage experiment (concept of inverse problem). The results for different soils subjected to compaction showed that the estimated water potentials by the CPV method follow the commonly accepted assumptions that govern <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> conditions, justifying also the assumptions of the TFC concept. The <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> conditions estimated by the model demonstrated an adequate correspondence to the results of the CPV method, indicating its ability to assess the <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> conditions of the lysimeter soils...|$|R

In this research, the effects of water deficit stress on growth, yield, compatible metabolite accumulations (proline and carbohydrates) and plant ingredients were studied under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Water deficit levels included mild stress (90 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity),</b> medium stress (70 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity)</b> and severe stress (50 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity).</b> In 50 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> the plant didn't reach to seeding stage. Also, In this study, seed essence of plants under water stress, levels of 70 and 90 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> was obtained by distillation with water and chemical compounds of essence were analyzed by GC/MS method. The statistical results showed significant effects of water stress on growth parameters, seed yield, proline accumulation, carbohydrate accumulation, oil yield and essential oil percentage. The increase of water stress decreased plant height, number of lateral branches, dry weight and seed yield. However, oil yield, oil percentage, proline and carbohydrate contents increased. The highest amounts of proline and carbohydrate at the 50 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> (high stress) and also the maximum essential oil yield and percentage of essential oil at 70 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> were observed. Twenty-one chemical compounds were identified in both of the essences of Carum Copticum, and thymol, gamatherpinen and parasimen in each treatment were changed...|$|R

40|$|Dry {{conditions}} {{and lack of}} soil moisture availability, especially during planting time this spring, can create water stress resulting in delayed germination, a reduction in plant stands or may prevent seed germination. When a corn seed absorbs 30 percent of its weight in water the germination process commences. For comparison, soybeans absorb half of their weight in water before they germinate. Therefore, the level of soil moisture in the soil seedbed at planting dictates this critical process. For successful seed germination, ideally soil moisture should be at or close to <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> At <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> the soil retains {{the maximum amount of}} moisture. <b>Field</b> <b>capacity</b> is influenced by soil texture; for example, fine-textured soils, such as clay or loam soils, have larger moisture holding <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> than coarse-textured soils such as sandy-textured soils...|$|R

40|$|Liming {{has been}} mooted as a {{mitigation}} option for lowering soil N₂O emissions. This {{study investigated the}} effect of soil pH and soil water content on N₂O and N₂ emissions following the addition of synthetic urine (500 kg N ha⁻¹) containing ¹⁵N-labeled urea-N. Soil pH treatments ranged from 4. 7 to 7. 2 with either saturated or <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> soil. Dinitrogen and N₂O fluxes were measured from soil cores kept on water tension tables for 85 d following urine-N addition. Soil inorganic N transformations were also monitored over time by destructively sampling soil cores on five occasions over the 85 d. At <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> soil pH affected the N₂O fluxes with the lowest cumulative N₂O fluxes at soil pH 5. 9. Nitrous oxide losses ranged from < 0. 1 to 0. 4 % of ¹⁵N applied in the <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> treatment but this increased to be 0. 4 to 1. 7 % of the ¹⁵N applied in the saturated treatment. Dinitrogen fluxes were low (< 23 ng N₂–N cm⁻² h⁻¹) at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> but exceeded 4000 ng N₂–N cm⁻² h⁻¹ under saturated conditions. Cumulative N₂ fluxes increased with increasing soil pH in the saturated soil. The flux ratio of N₂O-N/(N₂O-N + N₂–N) remained high (0. 68 – 0. 71) under the <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> treatment but decreased with time from 0. 64 to 0. 16 in the saturated treatment. This study suggests that while the use of soil liming has merit for lowering N₂O emissions from urine patches where soils are at <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> the resulting NO₃–N will be susceptible to enhanced rates of N₂O and N₂ loss if the soils are wetted up beyond <b>field</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

Despite of the high number of PTFs published, most being class- or continuous-PTFs, accuracy of prediction remains limited. In this study, we compared the performance of different class- and continuous-PTFs developed with a regional database. Results showed that use of in situ volumetric water content at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> as a predictor led to much better estimation of water retention properties as compared to using predictors derived from the texture, or the organic carbon content and bulk density.

Comparison of in situ volumetric water content at <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> with the water retained at different matric potentials as measured in the laboratory, showed <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> to approximate 100 hPa whatever the soil texture. Finally, the lack accuracy of PTFs that do not use the in situ volumetric water content at <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> as predictor did not appear due to the test soils being unrepresentative of the soils used to develop the PTFs, but were instead related to poor correlations between the predictors used and the water retention properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different moisture and aeration {{conditions on the}} degradation of atrazine and isoproturon was investigated in environmental samples aseptically collected from surface and sub-surface zones of agricultural land. The materials were maintained at two moisture contents corresponding to just above <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> or 90 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> Another two groups of samples were adjusted with water to above <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> and, at zero time, exposed to drying-rewetting cycles. Atrazine was more persistent (t(1 / 2) = 22 - 3 S days) than isoproturon (t(1 / 2) = 5 - 17 days) in samples maintained at constant moisture conditions. The rate of degradation for both herbicides was higher in samples maintained at a moisture content of 90 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> than in samples with higher moisture contents. The reduction in moisture content in samples undergoing desiccation from above <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> to much lower than <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> enhanced the degradation of isoproturon (t(1 / 2) = 9 - 12 days) but reduced the rate of atrazine degradation (t(1 / 2) = 23 - 35 -days). This demonstrates the variability between different micro-organisms in their susceptibility to desiccation. Under anaerobic conditions generated in anaerobic jars, atrazine degraded much more rapidly than isoproturon in materials taken from three soil profiles (0 - 250 cm depth). It is suggested that some specific micro-organisms are able to survive and degrade herbicide under severe conditions of desiccation. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

High doses of N benefited the production of root shoots while the root increased its production at a dose of 40 kg N/ha. The number of green and senescent leaves were influenced by N fertilization and the water regime, where higher doses of N provided greater total number of green leaves (364 leaves/pot) and the limitation of water resulted in {{a greater number of}} senescent leaves (78 leaves/pot). Observing the maximum point, the water regime of 90 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> and 120 kg N/ha favored leaf appearance rate of 1. 2 leaves/day and less phyllochron (4. 6 days/leaf) at 85 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> and 115 kg N/ha. The dose of 120 kg N/ha resulted in ultimate greater width (1. 4 cm) and length (2. 4 cm) of the leaf at 100 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> The final length of stolons showed quadratic effect for N, having greatest length (58. 1 cm) at 75 kg N/ha and 100 % of <b>field</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} drought stress on osmotic adjustment, {{antioxidant}} enzymes activity and yield of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genotypes was investigated under pot culture conditions in rainout shelter. The drought condition was created at 15 days after transplanting based on <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> of soil. Experiment {{was laid out}} with eighteen genotypes by adopting completely randomized design with three replications and two treatments viz., 100 % and 50 % <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> As the stress increased from 100 per cent <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> to 50 per cent <b>field</b> <b>capacity,</b> reductions in relative water content (RWC), osmotic potential and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity were noticed at all the growth stages. The genotypes LE 114, LE 57, LE 118 and LE 27 which showed significantly less reduction in the RWC, osmotic potential and less increment of MDA, higher SOD and catalase activity during drought were considered as drought tolerant. Genotypes LE 1, LE 3 and LE 20 which recorded the lowest relative water content, osmotic adjustment and antioxidant enzymes activity and ultimately poor yield were considered as drought susceptible...|$|R
