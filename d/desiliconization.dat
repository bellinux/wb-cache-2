40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the silicon content to the maximum allowed value for the {{production}} of high-purity titanium dioxide, a hydrometallurgical process on the <b>desiliconization</b> during alkaline leaching of titanium slag under atmospheric pressure was studied. The effect of leaching temperature, initial NaOH concentration, leaching time and mass ratio of alkali to slag, on the efficiency of silicon removal were investigated. The results show that when the mass concentration of NaOH is 30 %, mass ratio of alkali to slag 3 : 1, the leaching temperature 120 degrees C and the retention time about 120 min, the content of silicon in solid is reduced to 0. 45 %. Simultaneously, the content of aluminum is reduced to 1. 62 %, without affecting the content of titanium.

40|$|Abstract. NaOH {{solution}} was utilized in the molten salt reaction of titanium slag for investigating <b>desiliconization</b> effects. The thermodynamic behaviors of Si in the reaction system was examined {{to explore the}} impacts of molten salt reaction conditions on the conversion rates of the foreign substance Si and the target element Ti. On this basis, the influences of NaOH concentration, liquid-solid ratio, cleaning temperature and cleaning time on Si removing rate were discussed. The experimental results showed that, Si reacted with NaOH to produce sodium silicate was feasible in terms of thermodynamics within the temperature interval 400 - 1000 K. 3 Na 2 O· 2 SiO 2, 2 Na 2 O·SiO 2 could stably exist under high reaction temperature. As the reaction time extended and temperature rose, the conversion rate of Si was increasing. In the process of Si removing by NaOH cleaning of molten salt reaction products, as NaOH concentration, liquid-solid ratio, cleaning temperature and cleaning time increased, Si removing rate became larger. The optimum alkali cleaning conditions were: NaOH concentration 150 g/l, liquid-solid ratio 3 : 1, cleaning temperature 50 ˚C and cleaning time 60 min, then the <b>desiliconization</b> rate reached 61. 16 %...|$|E

40|$|The modern {{production}} of aluminum which by its global output ranks first among the non-ferrous metals includes three main stages: ore extraction, its processing into alumina and, finally, the {{production of}} primary aluminum. Alumina production from bauxites,  being the  primary raw material in the  alumina industry,  is based  on two main methods: the Bayer method and the sintering method developed in Russia under the lead of an academician Nikolay Semenovich Kurnakov. Alumina production by the Bayer’s method is more cost effective,  but  has  higher  requirements to the  quality of the bauxite feedstock.   A great deal  of research has  been carried  out on low quality bauxites focusing firstly on finding ways to enrich the feedstock, secondly on improving the combined sequential Bayer-sintering method and thirdly on developing new hydrometallurgical ways for bauxites processing. Mechanical methods of bauxite enrichment have not yet brought any positive outcome, and a development of new hydrometallurgical high alkaline  autoclave process  faced  significant hardware  difficulties not addressed so far. For efficient processing of such low quality bauxite feedstock it is suggested to use a universal thermochemistry-Bayer method, which was developed in St. Petersburg Mining University under  the lead  of  Nikolay Ivanovich Eremin, allows to process different substandard bauxite feedstock and has a competitive costing {{as compared to the}} sintering method and combined methods. The main stages of thermochemistry-Bayer method are thermal activation of feedstock, its further <b>desiliconization</b> with the alkaline solution and leaching of the resultant bauxite product  under Bayer’s method. Despite high energy consumption at  the baking stage,  it  allows to condition the  low quality bauxite feedstock by neutralizing a variety of technologically harmful impurities such as organic matter, sulfide sulfur, carbonates, {{and at the same time}} to remove crystalline hydrate and free water. Subsequent <b>desiliconization</b> of thermally activated bauxite with an alkaline solution allows to regrade  it  from low quality bauxites to feedstock suitable for processing by the Bayer  method...|$|E

Preparing wheat straw microcrystalline cellulose using the cellulose decompounded from crop straws {{is a kind}} of efficient utilization of ligno-cellulosic resources. The preparation and <b>desiliconization</b> process of wheat straw microcrystalline cellulose were studied in this paper. The results showed that the optimal hydrolysis process parameters were as follow: hydrochloric acid concentration 2 moll - 1, hydrolysis temperature 70 °C, hydrolysis time 90 min, and solid-liquid ratio 1 : 15. After alkali treatment, the ash content of microcrystalline cellulose decreased substantially.

The object of {{investigation is}} development of new methods of utilization of alkaline silicate-containing waste materials by using these {{in the manufacture of}} ceramic tiles, fabrication of shell molds and lixiviation process. In their studies the researchers have employed a petrographic microscope and electronic microscope. The obtained investigation results have been computer-processed. The researchers have discovered a method of <b>desiliconization</b> of alkaline silicate-containing solutions without changing the pH value. Use of silicate-containing waste is likely to reduce moisture content and increase the yield of the slieker mass and step down the tile water absorption rate. The researchers have developed a new method of comprehensive processing of alkaline silicate-containing waste materials which permits curtailing the needs of the constructional materials industry and agricultural machine building branch as concerns sodium dioxide, sodium carbonate and sodium silicate.

Samples from XW and LK drill holes in this area were analyzed using XRD (X-ray diffraction) and SEM (scanning electronic microscope). Results show that clay minerals in the Nb-Zr-REE-Ga mineralized samples are composed of mixed layer illite/smectite (I/S); kaolinite and berthierine. I/S is the major component among the clay assemblages. The source volcanic ashes controlled the modes of occurrence of the clay minerals. Volcanic ash-originated kaolinite and berthierine occur as vermicular and angular particles, respectively. I/S is confined to the matrix and is derived from illitization of smectite which {{was derived from the}} original volcanic ashes.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{increase}} the knowledge of phenomena taking place during the initial stage in a top blown converter. The work has been done in a few steps resulting in four different supplements. Water model experiments have been carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The system investigated was a fundamental top blown converter where an air jet was set to impinge on a water surface. The flow field of the combined blown case, where an air jet was introduced through a bottom nozzle, was also captured by the PIV. The work clearly showed that the flow field caused by an impinging top blown jet alone could not match that of the bottom blown case. The main re-circulation loop (or vortex) was investigated with respect to position and it was found that an increased flow rate pushes the center of the re-circulation loop downwards into the bath. However, for the top-blown case there is a point when the flow rate is too large to cause a distinguishable re-circulation loop since the jet becomes more plunging (i. e. penetrates deep into the bath) than impinging, with large surface agitation and splashing as a result. A numerical model with the same dimensions as the experimental system was then created. Three different turbulence models from the same family were tested: standard-, realizable- and a modified-(slight modification of one of the coefficients in order to produce less spreading of the air jet) k-ε turbulence model. It could be shown that for the family of k-ε turbulence models the difference in penetration depth was small and that the values corresponded well to literature data. However, {{when it comes to the}} position of the re-circulation loop it was shown that the realizable k-ε model produced better results when comparing the results to the experimental data produced from the PIV measurements, mentioned earlier. It was then shown how the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could be coupled to thermodynamics databases in order to solve for both reactions and transport in the system. Instead of an air-water system, a gas-steel-slag system was created using the knowledge obtained in the previous simulation step described above. Reactions between gas-steel, gas-slag, steel-slag and gas-steel-slag were considered. Extrapolation of data from a few seconds of simulation was used for comparison to experimental data from the literature and showed reasonable agreement. The overall conclusion was that it is possible to make a coupling of the Thermo-Calc databases and a CFD software to make dynamic simulations of metallurgical processes such as a top-blown converter. A parametric study was then undertaken where two different steel grades were tested; one with high initial carbon content (3. 85 mass-%) and one with lower carbon content (0. 5 mass-%). The initial silicon content was held constant at 0. 84 mass-%. Different initial temperatures were tested and also some variation in initial dissolved oxygen content was tried. It was found that the rate of decarburization/desiliconization was influenced by the temperature and carbon concentration in the melt, where a high temperature as well as a high carbon concentration favors decarburization over <b>desiliconization.</b> It was also seen that the region affected by a lower concentration of alloys (or impurities) was quite small close to the axis where the impinging jet hits the bath. Add the oscillating nature of the cavity and it was realized that sampling from this region during an experiment might be quite difficult. QC 2010072...|$|E
