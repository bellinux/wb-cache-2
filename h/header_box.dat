40|$|Large {{air-cooled}} {{heat exchangers}} (ACHEs) are most popularly {{implemented in the}} petrochemical and power industries at arid locations. They operate on a simple concept of convective heat transfer, whereby air in the surrounding atmosphere is caused to flow across a tube bundle, which in turn transports a process fluid. The distribution {{and direction of the}} process fluid flow may furthermore be guided via a set of appropriately located header boxes, which essentially consist of a collection of welded flat plates and nozzle attachments. Perforations on one of the faces of these boxes serve as an interface to the tube bundle. The overall design and construction of an ACHE is commonly regulated by an American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is required to be used in conjunction with acceptable design codes. In spite of this, the design of certain <b>header</b> <b>box</b> configurations remains of prominent concern. It is the focus of the present study to investigate the approach adopted for a <b>header</b> <b>box</b> variant labelled as the removable cover type. In this configuration, one of the plates used to construct the <b>header</b> <b>box</b> is fastened and sealed by a collection of bolted joints and a gasket, allowing it to be removed. One appropriate design code for the <b>header</b> <b>box</b> equipment is the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) boiler and pressure vessel code. However, it provides no specific approach pertaining to the removable cover design. Instead it has been commonplace in industry for a number of aspects from this code to be synthesized, together with a collection of assumptions surrounding the <b>header</b> <b>box</b> behaviour, into an all encompassing design by rule approach. In this approach, the <b>header</b> <b>box</b> behaviour is accepted as being planar, whilst circumstances such as nozzle attachments and associated loading would suggest that a more comprehensive approach should be undertaken. The aim of the present study is therefore to critically evaluate the current practice, and establish its adequacy. To do so, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of an example <b>header</b> <b>box</b> design is developed. Subsequent comparisons with the stress distribution predicted via current practice show that the existing analytical model gives inaccurate and, in cases, overly conservative results. A new analytical approach developed from rigid frame theory is demonstrated to provide improved correlation with FEM. The linear elastic design by analysis approach, presented in the ASME code, is also utilised as a method for establishing design adequacy. Results obtained via design by analysis incorporating the finite element method are shown to be less conservative than those arising from design by rule methods. The design by analysis approach is also used to conduct a more detailed investigation of nozzle placement and external loading. In general, the effect of including a nozzle did not result in a significant increase in side plate stress, with failure more likely to occur within the nozzle wall.

After analysis had been performed, {{the crack in the}} tube strongly indicate that stress corrosion cracking was occurred by chloride. Chloride stress corrosion cracking (CLSCC) is the cracking occurred by the combined influence of tensile stress and a corrosive environment. CLSCC is the {{one of the most common}} reasons why austenitic stainless steel pipework or tube and vessels deteriorate in the chemical processing, petrochemical industries and maritime industries. In this thesis purpose to determine the appropriate inspection planning for two main items (tubes and <b>header</b> <b>box)</b> in the gas-cooling heat exchanger using risk based inspection (RBI) method. The result, inspection of the tubes must be performed on July 6, 2024 and for the <b>header</b> <b>box</b> inspection must be performed on July 6, 2025. In the end, RBI method can be applicated to gas-cooling heat exchanger. Because, risk on the tubes can be reduced from 4. 537 m 2 /year to 0. 453 m 2 /year. And inspection planning for <b>header</b> <b>box</b> can be reduced from 4. 528 m 2 /year to 0. 563 m 2 /year. </p...|$|E
40|$|The helium flow {{measurement}} method {{is very important}} for the design of HTR-PM. Water experiments and numerical simulation with a 1 / 5 scaled model are conducted to investigate the {{flow measurement}} method utilized in the steam generator of HTR-PM. Pressure information at specific location of the 90 elbows with the diameter of 46. 75 mm and radius ratio of 1. 5 is measured to evaluate the flow rate in the riser-pipes. Pressure uniformity {{at the bottom of the}} experimental apparatus is tested to evaluate the influence of the equipment error on the final experimental results. Numerical results obtained by using the realizable kappa- 8 model are compared with the experimental data. The results reveal that flow oscillation does not occur in the confluence system. For every single riser-pipe, the flow is stable despite the nonuniformity of the flow distribution. The average flow rates of the two pipe series show good repeatability regardless of the increases and decreases of the average velocity. In the <b>header</b> <b>box,</b> the flows out of the riser-pipes encounter with each other and finally distort the pressure distribution and the nonuniformity of the flow distribution becomes more significant along with the increasing Reynolds number...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} length of run {{and size of}} stream on {{moisture}} distribution in irrigated corn furrows was evaluated by three methods; namely, measurement of irrigation water flowing past three points in selected furrows, measurement of irrigation water added to soil as determined from soil samples, and measurement of variation in yield of corn produced on selected areas within the plot area. This study was conducted on a small area of field number 4 located on the Frenchman-Cambridge Irrigation Development Farm, near Arapahoe, Nebraska. The soil is classified as Hall Silty Clay Loam. The experimental area was divided into six 525 feet long plots of six rows each. The irrigation water applied to each plot was metered from <b>header</b> <b>boxes</b> equipped with four calibrated orifices.

2500|$|In the Eastern Conference semi-finals {{round of}} the 2012 MLS Cup playoffs, D.C. United faced arch-foe New York Red Bulls in what {{would become one of}} the most memorable playoff series in league history. The opening match of the home-and-home series was played in Washington, {{effectively}} giving New York the home field advantage of hosting the return match, despite the fact that United had finished higher in the standings. The game would have been played at Red Bull Arena, but New Jersey was still struggling to recover from the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Sandy. In the series opener, the teams drew 1-1, trading own goals midway through the second half. New York defender Roy Miller sent an attempted clearance into New York's net in the 60th minute. New York was awarded the tying goal, when Bill Hamid went up to take a <b>header</b> into the <b>box</b> away from a Red Bull defender who was standing directly in front of United's goalie. Hamid fell back into the goal while holding the ball, though he tried to keep it out. The ball was ruled across the line and no foul was given, leaving the teams deadlocked heading into the return match. United would also have to play that match without the gifted Andy Najar who received a second yellow card ejection for throwing a ball at a New York player with about 20 minutes remaining.|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{networks}} typically carry or deploy {{dozens of}} protocols and mechanisms simultaneously such as MPLS, NAT, ACLs and route redistribution. Even when individual protocols function correctly, failures can {{arise from the}} complex interactions of their aggregate, requiring network administrators to be masters of detail. Our goal is to automatically find an important class of failures, regardless of the protocols running, for both operational and experimental networks. To this end we developed a general and protocolagnostic framework, called Header Space Analysis (HSA). Our formalism allows us to statically check network specifications and configurations to identify an important class of failures such as Reachability Failures, Forwarding Loops and Traffic Isolation and Leakage problems. In HSA, protocol header fields are not first class entities; instead {{we look at the}} entire packet header as a concatenation of bits without any associated meaning. Each packet is a point in the { 0, 1 } L space where L is the maximum length of a packet <b>header,</b> and networking <b>boxes</b> transform packets from one point in the space to another point or set of points (multicast). We created a library of tools, called Hassel, to implement our framework, and used it to analyze a variety of networks and protocols. Hassel was used to analyze the Stanford University backbone network, and found all the forwarding loops in less than 10 minutes, and verified reachability constraints between two subnets in 13 seconds. It also found a large and complex loop in an experimental loose source routing protocol in 4 minutes. ...|$|R
