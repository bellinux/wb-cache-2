The project was divided up into four phases, in part, to maximize the ability of the project to receive funding from the Federal Government as part of the Department of Transportation's New Starts Program.

It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E

The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route.

The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E

In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta.
