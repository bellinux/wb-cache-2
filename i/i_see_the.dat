It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear.

K periodically helps arrange Beatles' conventions and other Beatles' {{events in the}} Hamburg area. She has no children, and now lives alone: [...] ""My [...] marriage ended in 1985...

Towards the song's end, she repeats [...] "they're coming for you" [...] in a [...] "reedy and distorted" [...] voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E

500|$|Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented {{positively}} on it, writing [...] "the {{spine of}} the CD is entirely white, {{while the rest of}} the sleeve features innovative photography and artwork, preparing the listener before they even hear the album for something very special". Jason Killingsworth of Paste wrote: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> swan, my eye drifts past its beak to those pillowy white feathers, recalling the plushness and warmth of a down comforter. Feathers so white they evoke the purity of freshly fallen snow blanketing the ground outside while you sip a coffee by the fire, both hands curled around the mug's warm ceramic finish".|$|E
500|$|On {{their way}} back to Salzburg Leopold and Wolfgang stayed for a while at Venice, pausing on their way at Brescia to see an opera buffa. While in Venice, Leopold used his letters of {{introduction}} to meet the nobility and to negotiate a contract for Wolfgang to write an opera for the San Benedetto theatre. Wolfgang gave several concerts and perhaps played at Venice's famed ospidali—former orphanages [...] which became respected music academies. The Mozarts were received generously, but Leopold appeared dissatisfied. [...] "The father seems a shade piqued", wrote a correspondent to the Viennese composer Johann Adolph Hasse, adding: [...] "...they probably expected others to seek after them, rather than they after others". Hasse replied: [...] "The father, as <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> man, is equally discontent everywhere".|$|E

[...] São Paulo manager was delighted with his team after the victory and agreed with Ceni that the victory was a team effort: [...] "It was a collective victory" [...] {{he also said that}} it was [...] "a great achievement for the club."

500|$|... "Something There" [...] has {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "where {{the genius of}} music as storytelling kicks in." [...] In Brew's opinion, the [...] "utterly convincing and un-mawkish" [...] song works [...] "because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other." [...] Brew concluded, [...] "Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this." [...] Filmtracks.com described [...] "Something There" [...] as an [...] "affable" [...] song. Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition." [...] Solomon concluded, [...] "By {{the end of the}} deceptively simple-sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem." [...] O'Hara continues to cite [...] "Something There" [...] as her favorite of the film's songs, elaborating, [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Beast with that grin on his face and the bird in his hand, my heart just melts." ...|$|E
500|$|In special {{elections}} in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky's House delegation. Returning to the Senate {{for a special}} session in July, Breckinridge {{was regarded as a}} traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his Confederate sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln's enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use [...] "the entire resources of the government" [...] for the war. Asked what he would do if he were president, he replied, [...] "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." [...] On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Benzema scored five goals; {{three in}} the league and two in Europe. In the league, he {{converted}} his three goals in wins over Osasuna and Valencia, while he scored his two Champions League goals in a 6–2 group stage win over Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. On 10 December 2011, Benzema scored the opener in Madrid's 3–1 defeat to Barcelona in the El Clásico. The goal, scored just 21 seconds into the match, was the fastest goal ever scored in a match between the two rivals. Three days after his record-breaking goal, for his performances during the 2011 calendar year, Benzema was named the France Football French Player of the Year, beating out Barcelona defender Éric Abidal and Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. He became only the second French player based in Spain to win the award, and also the second Real Madrid player to capture it. Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, [...] "It is a pleasure to win an individual trophy. When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> previous winners— Zidane, Henry and other major players— it makes me proud to join them on the list." [...] In the team's next match after winning the award, against Sevilla, Benzema assisted on two goals in a 6–2 triumph.|$|E

500|$|When the Senate convened for {{a special}} session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in {{opposition}} to the war. Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the Committee on Military Affairs. He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of habeas corpus. He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional. If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that [...] "all those sentiments of common interest and feeling... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent". On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." [...] Asked by Oregon's Edward Dickinson Baker how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, [...] "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Star {{described}} the Codeine's music as slowcore, a style AllMusic stated {{was famous for}} having a slow pace and skeletal music with [...] "melodies linger forever and rhythms lurch forward, all shrouded in thick, dank atmospherics." [...] Stewart Mason of AllMusic {{described the}} music of Barely Real as {{a continuation of the}} style made on their previous album", while comparing a review of the compilation album When <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>The</b> Sun in Exclaim! proposed that the group's music [...] "didn't change much during their five years together ― all the songs are relentlessly slow and possess an emotional detachment verging on apathy." [...] When asked about the music's pace, on Barely Real, Immerwahr said the music was in contrast to grunge music of the era, and that slowing it down made it [...] "challenging for people and challenging for audiences. And I actually kind of like that." [...] In a contemporary review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated this style is exemplified on songs like [...] "Realize", which continued the hybrid of a deliberate pace with electric guitar playing with softly sung vocals. Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine's music, such as [...] "Promise of Love", which Raggett characterized as having a [...] "late-night jazz club style" [...] that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end. Other songs that veried the sound included the piano-based track [...] "W." [...] performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on [...] "Jr". Immerwhar spoke about the tracks [...] "W." [...] and [...] "Promise of Love", [...] opining that [...] "W." [...] created a [...] "nice transition from the severity of 'Hard to Find' to the jazzy 'Promise of Love'" ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
