The tests were conducted on three groups of materials by exposure to the following three sources of exposure: radiant and Meeker burner flame, <b>heated</b> <b>coil,</b> and radiant source only. The first test series used radiant heat and flame exposures on easily obtainable test materials. Next, four materials were selected from the first group and exposed to an incandescent coil to provide the conditions for smoldering combustion.

30|$|In contrast, TE can derive appreciable current densities {{that are}} capable of {{stimulating}} X-ray emission. Figure  2 (a) shows examples of static and rotating anode TE X-ray sources. Significant current densities, and consequent heating therein, necessitate rotating anode and active cooling systems in TE sources. The core components of these systems are illustrated in Figure  2 (b) also outlines the principle mode of operation. Here, sealed in an inexpensive and easily fabricated evacuated glass or ceramic envelope, the electrons are liberated from a metallic filament, often made of Tungsten, which is Joule heated to in excess of 1000 °C [14]. Since the emission is intimately dependent on the filament temperature [15] – as increasing the emitter temperature allows for much of the electron population to pass over the surface barrier - such tubes enable analogue control over the magnitude of the emission current. In TE sources this beam current is controlled by monitoring the anode current and adjusting the inferred filament temperature using a closed-loop control system. The intrinsic finite thermal inertia of the <b>heated</b> <b>coil,</b> when coupled to the lagging response of such feedback control results in a comparatively slow time response, often several hundreds of milliseconds. In addition, care must be taken to limit the filament drive current to prevent excessive power dissipation, with subsequent damage or destruction of the filament. Issues with severe electromigration can be a significant challenge. A key design functional parameter is the focal spot size, which is related, in part, to the dimensions of the electron emission area. In the case of TE sources the physical size of the filament, typically of the order of 2  mm in outer diameter and 10  mm in length. This requires the adoption of techniques to provide first order focussing. Some TE X-ray tubes are fitted with two filaments, allowing a choice of focal spot sizes, though this is at the expense of maximum available beam current and hence photon output. In order to achieve further reduction in focal spot size, electrostatic and magnetic focussing techniques are often employed, though at the expense of source complexity and size.|$|E
40|$|If a {{subsurface}} {{layer of}} peat is ignited, it smoulders (flameless combustion) slowly but steadily. These fires propagate {{for long periods of}} time (days, weeks, even years), are particularly difficult to extinguish and can spread over very extensive areas. Smouldering fires have an impact on the soil since the fuel burning is the combustible portion of the soil itself. An example of a peat fire is the recent wildfire that occurred this summer in Rothiemurchus, near Aviemore (Scotland). A 40 year old plantation of lodgepole pine of about 15 ha was burned accidentally. The main fire was extinguished within three days, but the peat underneath the forest continued to smoulder for more than thirty days, destroying the tree roots. Peat combustion processes remain mostly unknown to the fire community and more experimental and theoretical studies are needed. It is known that the smouldering of underground fuels is governed by the diffusion of heat and oxygen through the soil layers between the reaction site and the surface. It is highly desired to conduct more experiments on smouldering (aka glowing) combustion of peat to allow derivation of fire maps for forecast from information in the weather maps. The main factor controlling factor ignition is moisture content. This paper reports the measurements and observations from smouldering box experiments using peat from the UK. The smouldering box is a simple procedure which captures the essentials of peat ignition and burning. The test is conducted in a small box (side of ~ 20 cm) made of insulating side-walls and open on the top. The sample is ignited using an electrically <b>heated</b> <b>coil</b> running along one side of the peat. A successful ignition is followed by sustained smouldering combustion that consumes the sample. Temperature and spread rates are measured, and the residue is weighed and described. In our series of experiments we have found that the critical moisture content below which ignition is highly probable is 120 % ± 10 % (in dry basis). We found that this value compare well with that reported by researcher in Canada (~ 110 %) and Indonesia (> 120 %), which suggests that critical moisture content depends weakly on peat origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to ensure {{designing}} of full-function and stable CFD-simulation procedure for integrated thermal models of the transformers and the reactors, as well as to receive the approval of method of quality and abilities using the calculation examples of full-scale models of the equipment, along with autonomous models of coil-type windings having various design versions of heat-transfer intensification. Research Methods. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method of mathematical simulation of nonlinear processes as concerns hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the transformer equipment using finite-element analysis is employed. The results obtained. The paper presents the main elements of technique for creation of mathematical models; it also contains the examples of CFD-calculations as referred to axisymmetrical integrated models of furnace transformer and gapped-core shunt reactor, as well as the models of windings having design approaches of heat exchange intensification owing to «labyrinth» (partitions) and «alternation» (of number and locations) of axial cooling ducts. Scientific novelty. Scientific value of applied methodological approach {{lies in the fact that}} the developed models are the integrated ones, i. e., they consider geometry, loss, thermal parameters not only of the windings, but also of the main structural elements and cooling system. This ensures the quality and the accuracy of simulation of heat-and-mass transfer processes in complex structure of oil ducts and coils in the windings, enables to avoid erroneous «zigzag» oil flow movement through the groups of coil regular structures (without labyrinth and «alternation» of number and locations of axial ducts under conditions of transformer oil natural cooling as was deduced in the certain studies. Practical significance. Integrated models ensure calculation of oil temperature distribution within active part, including winding fields, oil temperature field between the tank and the windings, temperatures at oil outlet from the tank (top) and oil inlet into the tank (bottom). Calculations allow estimation of mean temperature distribution over the crosssection of winding coils, mean winding temperatures by means of averaging of the temperatures within the coils, detection of location and maximum temperature on the surface of conductors relevant to the most <b>heated</b> <b>coil.</b> The latter is treated as winding hot spot temperature (HST) and used to evaluate the aging of the contacting insulation. Determination of winding hot spot locations and temperatures (HST) is used as support data for installation areas of fiber optic probes for measurement during type testing, as well as in operational monitoring systems of the equipment. The results presented above are practically applied for industrial designing and testing of transformers and reactors...|$|E

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> in series in the air stream.
