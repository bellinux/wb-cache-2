2500|$|Lorde's work {{on black}} {{feminism}} {{continues to be}} examined by scholars today. [...] Jennifer C. Nash examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences. [...] Nash cites Lorde, who writes, [...] "I urge {{each one of us}} here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices." [...] Nash explains that Lorde <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear those Black women who are more ally than enemy." [...] Lorde’s 1979 essay “Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface” is a sort of rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it. Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end in order to end racist politics.|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth {{anniversary of}} the spill, NOAA {{scientists}} reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers. [...] Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out. [...] Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m3) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725 km) away. Some of the oil {{does not appear to}} have biodegraded at all. [...] A USGS scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks. [...] "The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise – or mousse." [...] Alaska state senator Berta Gardner <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil [...] to pay the final $92 million (£57 million) still owed from the court settlement. [...] The [...] major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{recurring}} motif is animal imagery, particularly, bird imagery. The first {{example is}} in Act 1, Scene 1, when Warwick says [...] " [...] dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells" [...] (l.47), {{a reference to}} falconry. Again in the opening scene, Henry claims that York will, [...] "like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh {{of me and my}} son" [...] (ll.269–270). Later, as York describes his failed attempts to win the recently concluded battle, he muses to himself, [...] "We botched again, as I have often seen a swan/With bootless labour swim against the tide" [...] (1.4.19–20). Subsequently, as Clifford tells York he will soon die, York declares [...] "My ashes, as the Phoenix', may bring forth/A bird that will revenge upon you all" [...] (1.4.35–36), to which Clifford replies [...] "So cowards fight when they can fly no further,/So doves peck the falcon's piercing talons" [...] (1.4.40–41). After the news of York's death has reached them, Richard encourages Edward to take York's place; [...] "If thou be that princely eagle's bird" [...] (2.1.91). Later, Warwick points out that Henry has been compelled to rescind his oath to yield the throne to the House of York; [...] "Clifford and the Lord Northumberland/And of their feather many more proud birds,/Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax" [...] (2.1.169–171). When Clifford <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> Henry to protect the Prince's birthright, he attempts to illustrate to Henry that doing the right thing for his children should be a natural course of action; [...] "Doves will peck in safeguard of their brood" [...] (2.2.18). During the debate about the rightful king, Edward refers to Clifford as [...] "that fatal screech owl/That nothing sung but death to us and ours" [...] (2.6.55–56). Bird imagery continues to be used contemptuously in France, where Margaret says of Edward and Warwick, [...] "both of you are birds of selfsame feather" [...] (3.3.161). Prior to the Battle of Barnet, as Somerset attempts to rally the troops, he says [...] "And he that will not fight for such a hope,/Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,/If he arise, be mocked and wondered at" [...] (5.4.55–57). When Richard visits Henry in the tower, Henry defends his suspicion of Richard's intentions; [...] "The bird that hath been lim'd in a bush,/With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush" [...] (5.6.13–14). Birds also play an important part in Henry's prophecy of Richard's future evil reign, as he points out the many ill omens accompanying Richard's birth; [...] "The owl shrieked at thy birth, an evil sign,/The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,/Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees,/The raven rooked her on the chimney's top,/And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung" [...] (5.6.44–48).|$|E

6000|$|... § XVI. We {{have much}} studied and much perfected, of late, the great civilized {{invention}} {{of the division of}} labor; only we give it a false name. It is not, truly speaking, the labor that is divided; but the men:--Divided into mere segments of men--broken into small fragments and crumbs of life; so that all the little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not enough to make a pin, or a nail, but exhausts itself in making the point of a pin, or the head of a nail. Now it is a good and desirable thing, truly, to make many pins in a day; but if we could only see with what crystal sand their points were polished,--sand of human soul, much to be magnified before it can be discerned for what it is,--we should think there might be some loss in it also. And the great cry that rises from all our manufacturing cities, louder than their furnace blast, is all in very deed for this,--that we manufacture everything there except men; we blanch cotton, and strengthen steel, and refine sugar, and shape pottery; but to brighten, to strengthen, to refine, or to form a single living spirit, never enters into our estimate of advantages. And all the evil to which that cry <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> our myriads can be met only in one way: not by teaching nor preaching, for to teach them is but to show them their misery, and to preach to them, if we do nothing more than preach, is to mock at it. It can be met only by a right understanding, on the part of all classes, of what kinds of labor are good for men, raising them, and making them happy; by a determined sacrifice of such convenience, or beauty, or cheapness as is to be got only by the degradation of the workman; and by equally determined demand for the products and results of healthy and ennobling labor.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{business}} or other {{brought me to}} London once more and I asked various Irish writers for letters of sympathy, and I was refused by none but Edward Dowden, who gave me what I considered an irrelevant excuse--his dislike for everything that Wilde had written. I heard that Wilde was at his mother's house in Oakley Street, and I called there, but the Irish servant told me, her face drawn and tragic as {{in the presence of}} death, that he was not there, but that I could see his brother. Willie Wilde received me with, [...] "Who are you; what do you want?" [...] but became all friendship when I told him that I had brought letters of sympathy. He took the bundle of letters in his hand, but said, [...] "Do these letters urge him to run away? Every friend he has <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> him to, but we have made up our minds that he must stay and take his chance." [...] "No," [...] I said, [...] "I certainly do not think that he should run away, nor do those letters advise it." [...] "Letters from Ireland," [...] he said. [...] "Thank you, thank you. He will be glad to get those letters, but I would keep them from him if they advised him to run away." [...] Then he threw himself {{back in his chair and}} began to talk with incoherent emotion, and in phrases that echoed now and again his brother's style at its worst; there were tear in his eyes, and he was, I think, slightly intoxicated. [...] "He could escape, oh, yes, he could escape--there is a yacht in the Thames, and five thousand pounds to pay his bail--well, not exactly in the Thames, but there is a yacht--oh, yes, he could escape, even if I had to inflate a balloon in the back yard with my own hand, but he has resolved to stay, to face it out, to stand the music like Christ. You must have heard--it is not necessary to go into detail--but he and I, we have not been friends; but he came to me like a wounded stag, and I took him in." [...] "After his release"--after the failure of his action against Lord Queensberry, I think--"Stewart Headlam engaged a room at an hotel and brought him there under another name, but the manager came up and said, 'Are you Mr. Wilde?' You know what my brother is, you know how he would answer that. He said, 'Yes, I am Oscar Wilde,' and the manager said he must not stay. The same thing happened in hotel after hotel, and at last he made up his mind to come here. It is his vanity that has brought all this disgrace upon him; they swung incense before him." [...] He dwelt upon the rhythm of the words as his brother would have done--"They swung it before his heart." [...] His first emotion at the thought of the letters over, he became more simple, and explained that his brother considered that his crime was not the vice itself, but that he should have brought such misery upon his wife and children, and that he was bound to accept any chance, however slight, that might reestablish his position. [...] "If he is acquitted," [...] he said, [...] "he will stay out of England for a few years, and can then gather his friends about him once more--even if he is condemned he will purge his offence--but if he runs away he will lose every friend that he has." [...] I heard later, from whom I forget now, that Lady Wilde had said, [...] "If you stay, even if you go to prison, you will always be my son, it will make no difference to my affection, but if you go, I will never speak to you again." [...] While I was there, some woman who had just seen him--Willie Wilde's wife, I think--came in, and threw herself in a chair, and said in an exhausted voice, [...] "It is all right now, he has made up his mind to go to prison if necessary." [...] Before his release, two years later, his brother and mother were dead, and a little later his wife, struck by paralysis during his imprisonment, I think, was dead, too; and he himself, his constitution ruined by prison life, followed quickly; but I have never doubted, even for an instant, that he made the right decision, and that he owes to that decision half of his renown.|$|E
