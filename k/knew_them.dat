5|$|A few historians {{believe that}} he later {{undertook}} a secret marriage to Elżbieta Szydłowska. However, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary who <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> both, this rumour only spread {{after the death of}} Poniatowski, was generally disbelieved, and moreover, was circulated by Elżbieta herself, so the marriage is considered by most to be unlikely.|$|E

The dead man's {{identity}} is unknown. Skinner returns to work, declining to say to Mulder how he <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> {{to be at the}} hotel. After Mulder leaves, he reaches into his drawer and puts his wedding ring back on.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, Fraser had {{successfully}} passed her medical examinations and become licensed. Two years later, Fraser became a part-time lecturer {{and then in}} 1934 was promoted to full-time lecturer in the department. Around the same time, in 1933, Williams moved to the farm full-time, returning to Toronto only on weekends. In 1937, she was finally accepted into the Ontario Veterinary College and that same year, Fraser's mother died. Williams graduated in 1941 and she began practicing as a veterinarian. For the first time, the two women acquired a home together, living in Toronto. They took in a foster child, Jenny Rodd, a war refugee from England, who remained with them until the war ended. Rising homophobia during the war-years, which carried into the 1950s and 1960s led the couple to hide the intimate nature of their relationship from their ward and present an ambiguous relationship to the greater society, limiting their social life to those who <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> best.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who <b>knew</b> <b>them.</b> A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E

They wore clothes made of tanned hides, which the women prepared and sewed. They often decorated their dresses in elk teeth. The kindred Pawnee called them Kírikuuruks / Kírikuruks ("bear-eyed people") and the Arikara Čirikuúnux (a reference to the Wichitas' tattoos). The Kiowa <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> as Thoe-Khoot ("tattoo faces").|$|E

The marriage of Grant and Emily was expected by all who <b>knew</b> <b>them.</b> However, Emily then announced publicly her opposition to polygamy, which caused a falling out between Grant and Emily.|$|E

25|$|To Gog and Magog {{were also}} {{attached}} a legend, certainly current by the Roman period, {{that they were}} people contained beyond the Gates of Alexander erected by Alexander the Great.

In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the Huns, Khazars, Mongols, or other nomads, or even the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
25|$|This last {{discrepancy}} may {{be explained}} as Dalin wanting {{to talk to his}} father but not wanting to open the emotional floodgates of a reunion that both want but seem unable to take the first step towards. Instead Dalin asks Kolea about his parents, and Kolea replies as if he <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> well. On Games Day Germany in 2009 Abnett clarified this discrepancy being caused by the psychic influence of Agun Soric, which meddled with the character's thinking, and made Dalin forget the revealed identity of his father.|$|E

Alpines could not be sold in the UK under their own name because Sunbeam owned the trade mark (because of the mid-50s Sunbeam Alpine Mk I). In the 1970s, for example Dieppe were {{building}} modified Renault 5s for the worldwide market.

25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, Native Americans groups {{had not yet}} formed the large {{political}} “tribes” known from the historical era during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, and many tribal names used in historical literature do not apply in the seventeenth century. Many tribal names were actually amalgamations of earlier groups that had been decimated by wars and disease and banded together for mutual safety. Groups were also known by many different names, which also made identifying specific groups difficult. Group names were often recorded before the group met Europeans, and was frequently the name that enemies <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> by and in a different language family from what the group themselves spoke. These names were then transliterated into several European written languages, particularly French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. These European languages often had different phonetic stylings for the foreign languages of the Native Americans, and this translation and transliteration was conducted in an era before many modern writing conventions, resulting in inconsistent spelling, grammar and alphabetic characters.|$|E
25|$|Special commemorations held in Markowa on 24 March 2007 – 63 {{years after}} the Ulma, Szall and Goldman {{families}} were massacred. Mass was celebrated, followed by the Way of the Cross {{with the intention of}} the Ulma family's beatification. Among the guests was the President of the Council of Kraków, who laid flowers at the monument to the dead. The students of the local high-school presented their own interpretation of the Ulmas' family decision to hide Jews in a short performance entitled Eight Beatitudes. There was also an evening of poetry dedicated to the memory of the murdered. Older neighbors and relatives who <b>knew</b> <b>them</b> spoke about the life of the Ulmas. One historian from the Institute of National Remembrance presented archival documents; and, the Catholic diocesan postulator explained the requirements of the beatification process. On May 24, 2011, the completed documentation of their martyrdom was passed on to Rome for completion of the beatification process.|$|E
