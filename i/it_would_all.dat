5|$|In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath {{was killed}} in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> eventually be confiscated.|$|E
25|$|Although the GCFC bid team met all the {{criteria}} during their {{presentation to the}} AFL Commission, several stadium issues continued to delay the process. Initially, the Government of Queensland intended to uphold a contract clause that stated a second AFL team in Queensland must play all home games at the Gabba until 2016. The clause was later loosened and the AFL sought out joint funding for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium. The AFL was able to conjure up the funds needed for the redevelopment but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> hinge on whether the Queensland Labor Party would be re-elected in the 2009 state election.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E

500|$|Brasenose's {{reputation}} for law remained, under firstly Ron Maudsley– a Tutorial Fellow in the Stallybrass mould– and Roman and Civil law lecturer and tutor Barry Nicholas, [...] then Peter Birks, another Roman lawyer and sometime Regius Professor of Civil Law at All Souls, Harry Lawson, the first Professor of Comparative Law, and Sir Otto Kahn-Freund, an employment law specialist. There {{was also a}} growing {{reputation for}} English literature– staff Ian Jack and Alastair Fowler among them. Other notable staff included Robert Shackleton, tutor in French, sometime librarian and Senior Dean; Sir Ronald Syme, Camden Professorship of Ancient History (previously held by Last, with whom we would continue a personal dispute). <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> mean the Brasenose's fellows in 1970 were dominated by Britain's top academic minds, however disjunct from academic success that would become. One subject to develop after 1970, however, was Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE). Bogdanor continued to lead a formidable group of fellows and undergraduates: Peter J.N. Sinclair, Michael Woods, John Foster, and Tony Courakis; Lord Robin Janvrin, Kate Allen, Catharine Hill, and British Prime Minister David Cameron.|$|E
500|$|On the surface, it {{may seem}} that the Smoking Man merely tries to hide {{information}} from Mulder and Scully, but {{there is much more}} to him. He is involved in the Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode [...] "One Breath", he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls [...] "the game") because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: [...] "If people were to know of the things that I know... <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> fall apart". He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the [...] "black oil", a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel {{announced}} that Sony would be releasing a Spider-Man film co-produced by Marvel Studios president Feige and Amy Pascal, with Sony Pictures continuing to own, finance, distribute, and have final creative {{control of the}} Spider-Man films. In April 2015, Feige confirmed the character would be Peter Parker and added that Marvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the MCU since at least October 2014, when they announced their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, [...] "Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [...] were to happen with Sony, how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> shift. We've been thinking about [...] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.” In June 2015, Tom Holland was cast {{in the role of}} Spider-Man and Jon Watts was hired to direct the film, and the next month, John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein were hired to write the screenplay. Additional screenwriters include Watts & Christopher Ford and Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers. In April 2016, the title was revealed to be Spider-Man: Homecoming. Production began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta, and concluded in October 2016. Spider-Man: Homecoming premiered on June 28, 2017 in Hollywood, and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5, and the United States on July 7, 2017.|$|E

500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as [...] "very focused," [...] and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive [...] "group" [...] atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return {{the next day to}} sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that [...] "I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff I had, and it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that." [...] Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated:It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, he kind of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial," [...] several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no [...] "bass wobbles" [...] reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as [...] "very raw" [...] by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was [...] "rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually." [...] While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as [...] "the fastest record we ever made." [...] In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the [...] "final product," [...] (only later to be changed) describing the album as [...] "dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the Australia Day weekend (24 and 25 January) 1970, Ourimbah was {{the venue}} for the [...] "Pilgrimage for Pop", the nation's first rock music festival. Saddington {{performed}} {{as a solo}} artist, with other acts including Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Jeff St John's Copperwine. Julie Kusko from The Australian Women's Weekly estimated some 6000 to 10000 attendees [...] "sat and watched, taking the long delays between poor performances without a murmur ... At night the music became better, and psychedelic lighting and colored searchlights helped. A couple of artists got standing ovations, surprisingly, for songs of the rock-'n-roll style of 15 years ago". Despite local predictions [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> turn into a drug and sex orgy", there was some nudity and drug use, but police only [...] "laid four charges of indecency and ten for language and offensive behaviour".|$|E

2500|$|Partly {{because the}} group lived {{for three months}} in {{northeast}} Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created {{one of the strangest}} anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song [...] "Disco Shock", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and {{what should have been a}} great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed to get the message and Serú Girán did not get their point across too well either. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> fuel wild speculations about the members' sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Marvel {{had been working}} to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they {{announced}} their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, [...] "Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [...] were to happen with Sony, how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> shift. We've been thinking about [...] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three." [...] It was said that Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for the Amazing Spider-Man series, would serve as executive producers, and neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield would return for the new film. Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man, with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners. In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film, while O'Brien {{said he had not}} been approached for the role. Goddard, who was previously attached to Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he [...] "didn't really have an idea" [...] for it, adding [...] "it's very hard to say, 'Ok, now write a new movie,'" [...] after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset. The next month, while promoting , Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film, which would not be an origin story, since [...] "there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [...] {{we are going to take}} it for granted that people know that, and the specifics." [...] Parker's Uncle Ben is referenced in the film, but not by name. Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man, with Holland and Butterfield the front-runners.|$|E
