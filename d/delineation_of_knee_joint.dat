The general reasons are incorrect body posture, shortage of lower limb muscle strength, lack of muscle liga-ment relaxation or improper footwork swaps in sports.

Methodology: This was a ccomparative experimental study with forty female healthy subjects from physiotherapy department of KPJ Healthcare University College, Malaysia. Convenient sampling method used to select the samples. The subjects were selected by inclusion criteria and randomly divided equally in to two with 20 subjects in each group. Isometric strengthening exercise and squatting exercise were given as intervention program for eight weeks respectively for experimental and control group. Pre and post data of quadriceps muscle strength measured were collected separately at 45 and 90 degree <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> using goniometry during resisted extension <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> in multi gym. Result: In experimental group Pre –Post statistical analysis found significant effect in increase of quadriceps strength at 45 and 90 degree with P< 0. 0001. ****In control group quadriceps pre-post statistical analysis found no significant effect in increase of quadriceps strength at 45 and 90 degree with P< 0. 083 NS and P< 0. 055 NS respectively.

40|$|Objective. To assess {{significance}} of arthrosonography in diagnosis <b>of</b> in <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> changes {{in patients with}} early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Material and methods. 44 patients with early RA aged 19 to 73 years were examined. 29, 5 % of pts had early RA without primary osteoarthritis (OA), 70, 5 % had early RA with primary OA. Ultrasonography <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> was performed with Diasonics (USA, 1997) by the linear sensor with frequency of 7 MHz. The protocol of ultrasonic examination <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> was filled for each pt. Results. Clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> synovitis have been revealed in 61, 5 % of pts with early RA without primary OA, and in 80, 6 % of pts with early RA with primary OA, ultrasonic - in 100 % <b>of</b> pts. Intraarticular <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> effusion resulted in increase of suprapatellar bursa and lateral recesses size. Extraarticular inflammation was frequently shown by thickening of semymemranous muscles tendons, especially in pts with the early RA with primary OA (p< 0, 005). Degenerative changes {{in the group of}} pts with primary OA were more expressed in early RA and usually accompanied by non-uniform decrease of cartilage thickness and occurrence of osteophytes while cartilage in pts with early RA without primary OA had normal thickness or thickening because of swelling, and osteophytes were absent. Conclusion. Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> intraarticular and extraarticular inflammatory changes over degenerate changes (symmetric thickening of the synovium, primary increase of the sizes of suprapatellar bursa and lateral recesses because of effusion, thickening <b>of</b> tendons <b>of</b> <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> at the normal or increased thickness of cartilage because of inflammation) can be considered sonographic sign of early RA. In pts with early RA coincided with primary OA these changes were usually found in combination with non-uniform decrease of cartilage thickness.
