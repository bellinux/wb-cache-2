5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the <b>ground,</b> <b>before</b> it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt failed, and Mehmed {{marched to the}} Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered an additional 20,000 impaled Turks. The Sultan and his troops then sailed to Brăila and burned it to the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> retreating to Adrianople. Both sides would claim victory, while Mehmed II's forces returned home with many captured slaves, horses and cattle.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E

5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Many {{athletics}} and cycle events {{took place at}} the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the First World War, and boxing has been hosted on several occasions. On 28 June 1948, Dick Turpin, brother of Randolph Turpin, became the first non-white boxer to win a British title in a fight against Vince Hawkins in front of 40,000 spectators after the British Boxing Board of Control lifted their ban on non-whites challenging for titles. On 21 June 1972 Danny McAlinden defeated Jack Bodell in a British and Empire Heavyweight title fight.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E
5|$|Millwall began {{life on the}} Isle of Dogs and {{inhabited}} {{four different}} grounds in the club's first 25 years. Their first home {{was a piece of}} waste ground called Glengall Road, where they only stayed for one year. From 1886 to 1890 they played behind The Lord Nelson pub on East Ferry Road, which was known as the Lord Nelson <b>Ground,</b> <b>before</b> being forced to leave by the landlady, who received a better offer for its use.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> transport by aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop an Egyptian invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop or delay the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would try to create facts on the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} years {{following}} Kenilworth Road's renovation saw average attendances of between 15,000 and 18,000; a huge improvement {{on what the}} club had previously been able to attract. Floodlights were installed at the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the 1953–54 season, and used {{for the first time}} in a friendly against Turkish side Fenerbahçe on 7 October 1953. The Oak Road terrace was extended in 1955, and promotion to the First Division for 1955–56 saw the average attendance climb as high as 21,454.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E

5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level <b>ground,</b> <b>before</b> he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June, a {{combined}} force from Nos. 4 and 5 Troops under {{command of the}} second-in-command, Major John Pooley, carried out {{an attack on the}} Merville battery near the coast where there were still guns firing on the landing beaches. The battery had been taken the previous day by a force from the 9th Parachute Battalion, but had been reoccupied later by the Germans and it was heavily defended by mortars and landmines. Approaching from the south, No. 4 Troop moved across the open <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> taking up position behind the hedgerows 300 yards from the battery and from where laid down covering fire for No. 5 Troop which approached from the east with fixed bayonets.|$|E
