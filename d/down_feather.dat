60|$|It was low, {{and covered}} with thick vegetation,--chiefly a kind of palm, that was new to me. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a <b>down</b> <b>feather.</b> We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand, and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth. Half way up was a square {{enclosure}} of some greyish stone, which I found subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava. Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood awaiting us at the water's edge. I fancied while we were still far off that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face. He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making the most grotesque movements.|$|E

In the Ghost Dance, a religious movement that became particularly widespread among the Plains Indians, each dancer held a painted feather that was tipped with a <b>down</b> <b>feather</b> painted with another color; the feathers were generally those of a crow, which was sacred to the Ghost Dance, or of an eagle, which was sacred to all tribes. [...] Zuni prayer sticks were also made using eagle down. While eagle feathers belonged to the Sun Priest, who planted them to the sun, other priests could use them if rain was needed, as the down is said to suggest [...] "fleecy clouds that gather on the horizon before rain".

In the epidermis, phosphatase was present in the nucleoli of the cells of the barbs and in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cylinder cells. The pattern of activity was the same with all substrates except yeast adenylic acid, although the intensity of the reaction varied with the various substrates. With yeast adenylic acid, epidermal activity was confined primarily to the nucleoli of the cells;To determine whether the differences in reactivity were due to different phosphatases, the activating or inhibiting effects of Mg++, Mn++, Be++, Zn++, Fe+++, HAsO 4 =, HAsO 3 =, CN-, semicarbazide, iodoacetate, Versene, glycine, alanine, cysteine, histidine, methionine, proline, valine, serine, lysine, and arginine were studied in conjunction with several of the substrates;Mg++ was necessary for activity with muscle adenylic acid, hexose diphosphate, and fructose- 6 -phosphate. At high concentrations, Zn ++ inhibited activity with all substrates except fructose- 6 -phosphate, and in low concentration stimulated activity with yeast adenylic acid. Yeast adenylic acid showed strong nucleolar activity at concentrations of arsenate which inhibited activity with all other substrates. Versene, iodoacetate, semicarbazide, Be++, and CN- in high concentrations inhibited phosphatase activity. Mn++, Fe+++, and HAsO 3 = had no apparent effect on phosphatase. Cysteine and histidine had a greater inhibitory effect on phosphatase than the other amino acids. At low concentrations, glycine promoted activity with muscle adenylic acid. Valine, proline, and methionine in low concentrations gave some indication of possible stimulation of activity with sodium glycerophosphate;The activity of phosphatase with yeast adenylic acid differs from that with muscle adenylic acid in its response to some of the inhibitors and activators. The activity with both of the adenylic acids differs from that obtained with sodium glycerophosphate. The fructose sugars were inhibited by lower concentrations of the chemicals than inhibited activity with sodium glycerophosphate;Epidermal phosphatase shows a greater sensitivity to the inhibiting agents than the phosphatase in the pulp. Cytoplasmic phosphatase is more easily inhibited than that in the nucleoli;These data indicate that the nucleolus is the source of {{at least part of the}} phosphatase.

40|$|<b>Down</b> <b>feathers</b> are {{remarkable}} {{insulating materials}} that reputedly {{have the greatest}} warmth-to-weight ratio of all natural fibres, and they possess excellent compressibility and compression recovery. Despite their outstanding performance as thermal insulators, <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> have been relatively overlooked by the academic community and their structure and properties remain quite poorly understood. To {{provide insight into the}} fundamental properties of these feathers and to inspire the design and development of future synthetic insulation materials, a study into the structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> and their assemblies has been conducted. The appearance, mass, size, and geometric shape of goose, duck, and eider down plumes and their barbs were assessed. While goose and duck down plumes were very similar in both appearance and size, the eider <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> were found to be larger and their barbules had a greater number of prongs and nodes. In each type of down, barbules were adapted to occupy maximum space and utilised a planar cross-section as they divided from the barb to optimise compression recovery. The microstructure and morphology of goose and duck down barbs and barbules were analysed using SEM, TEM, and AFM and were found to be analogous to wool fibres. Melanin granules were found in goose down but not in duck down, and the examined goose down barbs had irregular, hollow cross sections, whereas duck down’s were solid and more elliptical. With the help of novel down-based nonwovens developed to capture X-ray diffraction data from goose and duck down with excellent clarity, goose and duck down were found to share great similarities in their crystal structures. The mechanical properties of goose, duck, and eider <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> were studied, including a comparison of their barbs’ tensile properties and the compression resistance and recovery of individual down plumes. Eider down barbs were found to have greater Young’s moduli, ultimate strength, and strain at break than goose or duck down barbs, and individual eider down plumes were also more compression resistant than those from geese and ducks. The compression resistance and recovery of goose and duck down assemblies were studied using a novel apparatus. Goose down proved to be more compression resistant than duck down, attributed to its cross sectional shape and hollow geometry. The thermal resistances of goose and duck down-filled test squares were extremely similar, but the densities of the down inside the face fabrics strongly influenced their thermal resistances. Air-laid and thermal-bonded down-feather-based nonwovens were developed to alleviate the problem of constraining individual <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> in insulated products. Their structural and thermal properties were evaluated and they possessed industry-leading warmth-to-weight ratios, which could be further improved by better engineering of these composite materials. Great efforts have been made to provide a comprehensive investigation into the structure and properties of both individual and bulk <b>down</b> <b>feathers</b> in relation to their thermal insulation properties. It is hoped that this research will prove useful to the development of superior biomimetic synthetic insulations as well as the high performance products made from down, a world-leading natural material. ...|$|R
