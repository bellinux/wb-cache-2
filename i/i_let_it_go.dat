60|$|I am {{an honest}} dog, and hate to obtain credit under false pretences, but--liver is liver. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course to}} {{continue}} such a dialogue {{would have been}} tedious and unprofitable, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go,</b> and took the consequences.|$|E
6000|$|... "They wouldn't let me then. I {{thought they}} mightn't find him guilty here--so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on. And now he's dead. You don't know how I feel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Mr. Fish {{has said}} that, I believe,’ {{returned}} his lady, {{glancing at the}} letter. ‘But, upon my word, Sir Joseph, I don’t think <b>I</b> can <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> after all. <b>It</b> is so very dear.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Has {{the money}} you left upstairs gone into his greedy pockets already?" [...] she asked. [...] "If I was as rich as you are, <b>I</b> should <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> In your place, I wouldn't touch him {{with a pair of}} tongs!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it, Daly; that's {{what we must}} prevent. You know, for {{the sake}} of the family, <b>I</b> couldn't <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on. Then, poor creature, she'd be plundered and ill-treated--she'd be a downright idiot in no time; and, you know, Daly, the property'd go to the devil; and where'd I be then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Mary, [...] "you {{see that}} if <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go,</b> it will descend of course {{as much as}} it can, for the earth draws it downwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Decker {{shook his}} head sorrowfully. [...] "No, Elsie, not mine. I {{had the chance to}} do it once, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> It's done now--but not by me." ...|$|E
60|$|What is {{all this}} in writing! It is only some sort of relief to my full heart, and shows very little of it to you; but that's something, so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it was late, and anyway, <b>it</b> <b>went</b> {{down on my}} expense-account--gosh, if I'd {{been paying}} it instead of the firm, I'd 'a' tramped the streets all night before I'd 'a' let any hick tavern stick me seven great big round dollars, believe me! So <b>I</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that. Well, the clerk wakes a nice young bell hop--fine lad--not a day over seventy-nine years old--fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and doesn't know it's over yet--thought I {{was one of the}} Confederates, I guess, from the way he looked at me--and Rip van Winkle took me up to something--I found out {{afterwards}} they called it a room, but first I thought there'd been some mistake--I thought they were putting me in the Salvation Army collection-box! At seven per each and every diem! Gosh!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} been a beauty and had never thought myself one, but I had been very {{different}} from this. <b>It</b> was all <b>gone</b> now. Heaven was so good to me that <b>I</b> could <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> with a few not bitter tears and could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Enjoy it? So {{you think}} I enjoy it! What {{do you suppose}} I'm made of? Perhaps you think I enjoyed catechizing the child about her {{feelings}} toward him? Perhaps you think I enjoy the whole confounded affair? Well, I give <b>it</b> up. <b>I</b> will <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> If <b>I</b> can't have your full and hearty support, I'll <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> I'll do nothing about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had an hesitation. [...] "Yes, {{she showed}} me her letter. She wouldn't have done {{anything}} else. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> because I didn't know what course was best. I'm afraid to oppose her to her face." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was dead}} {{opposite}} to my Aunt Agatha's philosophy of life, she having always rather given {{me to understand}} that it is the presence in it of chappies like me that makes London more or less of a plague spot; but <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Her {{voice had}} been growing fainter and fainter as she proceeded. She leaned against me heavily. One glance at her {{told me that if}} <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on any longer she would fall into a swoon. [...] "Tell your brother that we have gone back to the rectory," [...] I said to Nugent. He looked up at Lucilla for the first time.|$|E
60|$|I {{had always}} felt my weakness, in {{comparison}} with her constancy and fortitude; and now I felt it more and more. Whatever I might have been to her, or she to me, if I had been more worthy of her long ago, I was not now, and she was not. The time was past. <b>I</b> had <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> by, and had deservedly lost her.|$|R
60|$|That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't {{no use to}} say any more; {{because when}} he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn't make out how {{he was willing to}} go into this thing; so <b>I</b> just <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go,</b> and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] Murray disputed, [...] "is an open point. If I {{had been}} in your place and could have hit the bird, <b>I</b> wouldn't have <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> However, if the firing hasn't made them wild, you may get another chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{should be}} afeared {{to marry a}} poet, if they are such strange and {{delicate}} creatures as I've heard tell. 'Twould be like keeping house for a butterfly. I tried to cage one once; but the poor thing spoilt its pretty wings beating against the bars, and when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> it just dropped down and died among the roses there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah--g'wan!" [...] said McGuire, with a {{flash of}} his old asperity, [...] "nobody can't bluff me. You never ast me. You made your spiel, and you t'rowed me out, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at dat. And, say, friend, dis chasin' cows is outer sight. Dis is de whitest bunch of sports I ever {{travelled}} with. You'll let me stay, won't yer, old man?" ...|$|E
60|$|So we did--with hands which shook so, that {{we hardly}} {{knew what we}} were about. The lot fell to me, and I went down. The water was so muddy I could not see anything, but I felt around among the hoop poles, and {{presently}} grasped a limp wrist which gave me no response--and if it had I should not have known it, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> with such a frightened suddenness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} it wouldn't be at all like him to do so," [...] said Mrs. Corey, going on to {{entangle}} herself in her words, as women often do when their ideas are perfectly clear. [...] "Don't go to reading, please, Bromfield! I am really worried about this matter I must know how much <b>it</b> means. <b>I</b> can't <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on so. <b>I</b> don't {{see how you can}} rest easy without knowing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whisper," [...] {{she said}} to me, with a {{peculiar}} but very proper aspiration on the h--"Wh-hisper," [...] and both by the aspiration {{and the use of}} the word I knew at once from what island she had come. [...] "Mr. Greene keeps all his money in this box also; so <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> out of my sight for a moment. But whatever you do, don't tell him that I told you so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wot?" [...] {{says the}} second mate, staring at ’im. [...] "Your mattress, sir," [...] says Bill. [...] "If I might make so bold as {{to offer a}} pound for it, sir. I want {{something}} wot’s been used by you, and I’ve got a fancy for that as a keepsake." [...] The second mate shook ’is ’ead. [...] "I’m sorry, Bill," [...] ’e says, gently, [...] "but <b>I</b> couldn’t <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{through that}} fight I was scared nearly to death. I hardly knew anything, I was so frightened; but you see, nobody knew that but me. Next day General Polk sent for me, and praised {{me for my}} bravery and gallant conduct. I never said anything, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that. I judged it wasn't so, {{but it was not}} for me to {{contradict}} a general officer.|$|E
60|$|Real estate! That's nothing! Why {{they told}} me that fifteen years ago I could have had all sorts of things,--trunk line railways, sugar refineries, silver mines,--any of them for a song. When I heard it I was half glad I hadn't sung for the land. They told me that {{there was a time when}} I could have bought out the Federal Steel Co. for twenty million dollars! And <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] {{said the}} man slowly, with a faint flush in his heavy face. [...] "After all, one comes {{to look at these}} things differently, and I dare say those fellows are right who lay it down that one ought to do {{something}} for his country or his living. Once I had the opportunity, but <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go,</b> or rather I flung it away. I often wish I hadn't, but I'm not quite sure it's altogether too late now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You give me credit," [...] the Prince said slowly, [...] "for great generosity. If <b>I</b> <b>let</b> you <b>go</b> <b>it</b> {{seems to}} me that I shall lose you altogether. You will go to your husband. He will take you away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's {{where the}} old Marshalton race-course used to be,' said Zigler. 'That {{ice-house}} is called Flora's Temple. Nell Gwynne and Mrs. Siddons an' Taglioni an' all that crowd used to act plays here for King George the Third. Wasn't it? Well, George is the only king <b>I</b> play. <b>Let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that. This circle was the stage, I guess. The kings an' the nobility sat in Flora's Temple. I forget who sculped these statues at the door. They're the Comic and Tragic Muse. But it's a sightly view, ain't it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|After a silence, Norman said, [...] "Papa, {{there is}} a thing I can't settle in my own mind. Suppose there had been wrong things done when older boys, and {{excellent}} ones too, were {{at the head of}} the school, yet they never interfered, do you think <b>I</b> ought to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{good deal}} of news went astray about that time," [...] he remarked grimly. [...] "I was left, and forgotten. When I found what had been done, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> It {{seemed to me to}} be better. I went up to Rhodesia, and of course I had the devil's luck. I've come back to Europe simply because I couldn't stand it any longer. I was not coming to England, and I had no idea of seeing you, Emilie! I {{travelled}} here on a little pilgrimage." ...|$|E
60|$|Sunday, 18th.--I shall put in this {{envelope}} {{the end of}} the ever-to-be-execrated Ebb Tide, or Stevenson's Blooming Error. Also, a paper {{apart for}} David Balfour. The slips must go in another enclosure, I suspect, owing to their beastly bulk. Anyway, there are two pieces of work off my mind, and though I could wish I had rewritten a little more of David, yet it was plainly to be seen it was impossible. All the points indicated by you have been brought out; but to rewrite the end, in my present state of over-exhaustion and fiction-phobia, would have been madness; and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> as it stood. My grandfather is good enough for me, these days. I do not work any less; on the whole, if anything, a little more. But it is different.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{sacrifice}} you--I couldn't sacrifice you," [...] she said, {{as soon as}} {{she could}} speak again; [...] "but I can't believe in a good for you, that I feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward others. We can't choose happiness either for ourselves or for another; we can't tell where that will lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment, or whether we will renounce that, for the sake of obeying the divine voice within us,--for the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is hard; it has slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt that if <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> forever, I should have no light through the darkness of this life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he went on, when I had {{acknowledged}} it, [...] "if I were you, <b>I</b> {{should not}} <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> any further. You will think me very impertinent, no doubt, but, none the less, I feel {{it to be}} my duty to advise you to have no {{more to do with}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We agreed we wouldn't {{talk about}} Shillito. I got the cut because I didn't {{want to see}} a young police trooper knocked out. People who meddle do get hurt now and then. Anyhow, it's some time since and <b>I</b> think we'll <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> Suppose you tell me about Montreal and your job at the store?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} the horse is mine, and <b>I</b> repeat <b>it.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>go</b> the bridle--let <b>it</b> go!" [...] Still, Fletcher, striving hard to keep his calm, clung to the reins. [...] "Let <b>it</b> <b>go,</b> you damned, thieving Scot!" [...] screamed Dare in a fury, and struck Fletcher with his whip.|$|R
