As secondary outputs it also provides the fire front rate of spread and a 3 D graphical model of the fire front that can be rendered from any virtual view. The method is automatic and non-intrusive, has space-time resolution close to continuum and can be run in real-time or <b>deferred</b> <b>modes.</b> It is demonstrated in simple laboratory experiments in beds of pine needles set upon an inclinable burn table, with point and linear ignitions but can be extended to open field situations...|$|R

50|$|The only {{common use}} of {{absolute}} mode—whose syntax combines immediate and deferred mode—is to specify input/output registers, as the registers for each device have specific memory addresses. Relative mode has a simpler syntax {{and is more}} typical for referring to program variables and jump destinations. A program that uses relative mode (and relative <b>deferred</b> <b>mode)</b> exclusively for internal references is position-independent; it contains no assumptions about its own location, {{so it can be}} loaded into an arbitrary memory location, or even moved, with no need for its addresses to be adjusted to reflect its location (relocated). In computing such addresses relative to the current location, the processor performed relocation on the fly.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for supporting reactive capability in an objectoriented GIS database, {{through the use}} of an event interface comprising an event generator and rule objects. This interface supports specification of events spanning sets of geographic-feature objects, and detection of primitive and complex events. Rules can be specified to apply either at a class level (i. e., to all instances of a given geographicfeature class) or at an instance level. In addition we allow evaluation of both pre- and post-conditions on changes to a feature. This approach is relevant in three distinct situations: (1) immediate mode, to execute rules immediately before or after some state change; (2) <b>deferred</b> <b>mode,</b> to execute rules at the end of several changes; and (3) detached mode, to perform rule-based actions separately from the state changes. GIS presents a rich set of problems for which this approach can be useful. This paper outlines the key elements of the rule-based approach employ [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Something {{interesting}} {{that most people}} do not associate with religion that often is the relationship it has with self-esteem and locus of control. In general people with high self-esteem relate more positive and loving images to God, where as people with low self-esteem may not do this because they feel God has been unloving and cold to them. [...] When explaining locus of control there are two different modes. The first is the <b>deferring</b> <b>mode,</b> where people believe that all power resides with God, which would be a low locus of control. The second is the self-directive mode. In this situation the person is active and God plays a more passive role in which they share power. People that use the latter mode tend to draw stronger associations to God, then do people with low locus of control.|$|R

40|$|A Distributed Real-time Active Database System (DRTADBS) {{reacts to}} the {{critical}} events occurred in the external environment by triggering of transactions. In this paper, the priority and deadline assignment to triggered transactions under two coupling <b>modes,</b> the <b>deferred</b> and immediate, in a DRTADBS is discussed. Two new approaches, the data state dependent (DSD) and the transaction-data deadline (TDD) are proposed to assign criticality and deadlines to the triggered transactions, respectively. In the DSD approach, the criticality of a triggered transaction is defined {{according to the state}} of the temporal data object which is responsible for its triggering. The objective of the DSD approach is {{to increase the number of}} commit achieved by the triggered transactions especially the more critical ones. The performance of these two approaches under the two coupling modes has been investigated. The results show that the DSD approach is more effective under the immediate coupling mode than under the <b>deferred</b> coupling <b>mode</b> due to the late creation of the triggered transactions under the <b>deferred</b> coupling <b>mode.</b> The TDD approach can improve the system performance under both deferred and immediate coupling mode. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{software}} product Intel ® Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) and new features are described. The primitives are {{the building blocks}} that application developers can easily integrate into their products-applications, components like media plug-ins or high level libraries, in order to significantly increase their performance on Intel and compatible architectures with Windows, Linux or MacOSX operating system installed. The IPP library covers many functional domains: image and signal processing; image coding and data compression; data integrity and cryptography; speech, audio and video coding, and others. Besides of the libraries IPP product contains 50 IPP based Samples released in the source codes. Some of the samples, for example, JPEG 2000 image codec and H 264 video codec are competitive to the commercial products.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{central theme}} of this thesis is the design and {{analysis}} of reliable and power efficient networking protocols under various application scenarios. The work consists of two major parts. The first part focuses on networking issues for reliable data transfer {{in the context of}} space communication. The second part investigates power efficient topology control for wireless ad-hoc networks.; In the first part of research, we consider reliable space communication. In many cases, space networking faces extremely long propagation delays, intermittent link connectivity, limitedbandwidth, and limited power budgets. Our main contribution is mathematical modelling and analysis of two ARQ schemes of CFDP, the <b>Deferred</b> NAK <b>mode</b> and the Immediate NAK mode, in the single-hop file transfer operation. We propose an ARQ timer-setting rule that minimizes the expected file delivery time under the constraint that the throughput efficiency is maximized. Then, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected file delivery time of the <b>Deferred</b> NAK <b>mode</b> of CFDP as well as upper and lower bounds expression for the expected file delivery time of the Immediate NAK mode of CFDP, respectively.; In the second part of research, we study power-efficient communication in wireless ad-hoc networks to provide end-to-end connectivity. Although power-efficient topology control can reduce the total power consumption of a network as a whole, a power-aware solution that allows power consumption to be evenly distributed among network nodes so as to prolong the network lifetime is highly desirable. Our main contribution is the development of a power-aware topology control algorithm and its associated CSMA/CA based MAC protocol. The proposed power-aware topology control algorithm at a given node only demands the residual energy levels and the location information of its reachable neighboring nodes. Besides, an algorithm to set up the RTS-CTS range in CSMA/CA-based MAC protocol is proposed to alleviate the hidden node problem, to avoid throughput degradation and to resolve the fairness problem. Finally, an analytical model that provides useful information to upper layer protocols to achieve better performance of the network is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} for hybrid transactional replication (HTR) of highly dependable services. It combines two schemes: a transaction is executed either optimistically {{by only one}} service replica in the <b>deferred</b> update <b>mode</b> (DU), or deterministically by all replicas in the state machine mode (SM); the choice is made by an oracle. The DU mode allows for parallelism and thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode guarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations and transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions can be discarded or retried on demand. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed transactional memory system, and evaluated it using several benchmarks: Bank, Distributed STMBench 7, and Twitter Clone. We tested our system under various workloads and three oracle types: DU and SM, which execute all transactions in one mode, and Hybrid—tailored specifically for each benchmark—which selects a mode for each transaction dynamically based on various parameters. In all our tests, the Hybrid oracle is not worse than DU and SM and outperforms them {{when the number of}} replicas grows.

We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed transactional memory system, and evaluated it thoroughly under various workloads. We show the benefits of using a novel oracle, which relies on machine learning techniques for automatic adaptation to changing conditions. In our tests, the ML-based oracle provides up to 50 % improvement in throughput when compared to the system running with DU-only or SM-only oracles.

40|$|Under-pricing in {{construction}} tenders {{is a common}} phenomenon and is commonly explained by the need of cash flows and penetration strategy. However, these explanations involve profit cutting and therefore are not plausible in explaining a long-term persistent phenomenon of under-pricing. A real options model is proposed and using the binomial lattice method a real-life construction project tender was analysed to examine how management flexibility and uncertainty provide real options value. When uncertainties of cost items in a tender exist and choices are available to <b>defer</b> and switch <b>modes</b> of construction, then a valuable option is available to the bidders. It amounts to about 4 % of the lump sum tendered in our case. The under-priced portion is the options value which the bidder {{is willing to pay}} for the flexibility and the uncertainty. These findings enable contractors to be more competitive and to estimate construction costs more accurately in devising their bid strategies. © 2006 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the early}} stages of a new {{influenza}} pandemic, travel restriction is an immediate and non-pharmaceutical means of retarding incidence growth. It extends the time frame of effective mitigation, especially when the characteristics of the emerging virus are unknown. In the present study, we used the 2009 influenza A pandemic as a case study to evaluate the impact of regulating air, sea, and land transport. Other government strategies, namely, antivirals and hospitalizations, were also evaluated. Methods Hong Kong arrivals from 44 countries via air, sea, and land transports were imported into a discrete stochastic Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) host-flow model. The model allowed a number of latent and infectious cases to pass the border, which constitutes a source of local disease transmission. We also modeled antiviral and hospitalization prevention strategies to compare the effectiveness of these control measures. Baseline reproduction rate was estimated from routine surveillance data. Results Regarding air travel, the main route connected to the influenza source area should be targeted for travel restrictions; imposing a 99 % air travel restriction delayed the epidemic peak by up to two weeks. Once the pandemic was established in China, the strong land connection between Hong Kong and China rendered Hong Kong vulnerable. Antivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions. Combined strategies (with 99 % restriction on all transport <b>modes)</b> <b>deferred</b> the peak for long enough to establish a vaccination program. Conclusion The findings will assist policy-makers with decisions on handling similar future pandemics. We also suggest regulating the extent of restriction and the transport mode, once restriction has been deemed necessary for pandemic control. Although travel restrictions have yet to gain social acceptance, they allow time for mitigation response when a new and highly intrusive virus emerges. </p...|$|R
