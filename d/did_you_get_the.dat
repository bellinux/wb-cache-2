2500|$|A {{series of}} emails {{released}} on 11/29/2015 containing 20,000+ pages of communications, including emails between Mary Willingham and other UNC staff members, seem to lend {{credence to the}} review board's refutation of Willinghams's methodology. Willingham never provided the methodology she used {{to come to her}} conclusions. Notwithstanding {{the fact that there is}} no methodology for combining multiple tests to determine grade levels, however there was one person who could completely confirm Willingham's findings. Lyn Johnson was the psychologist who administered and scored the tests in question and aggregated the data for the UNC academic support program. [...] In a January 16, 2014 email exchange between Johnson and Willingham, Johnson asks Willingham to explain her conclusions, stating [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> 60% reading below 8th grade level?" [...] Willingham didn't explain how, and that Johnson had to ask confirms Willingham didn't obtain her conclusions from Johnson. [...] This strongly supports the review board's findings that Willinghams's methodology was not appropriate.|$|E
