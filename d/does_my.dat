They featured the songs [...] "The Power of the Dream", [...] "Le fils de Superman", [...] "Fly", [...] "To Love You More", and a live version of [...] "Where <b>Does</b> <b>My</b> Heart Beat Now"; a cassette and 7" [...] vinyl version were also released. Another CD contained several dance remixes, although these attracted negative reviews. While praising its original form, Allmusic said that 'as a dance song, it misses the mark...the final 'Moran' mix is a little better [...] because the vocals don't pop up until {{three and a half}} minutes into the song'.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} Darwinism informs his {{everyday}} apprehension of life, Dawkins says, [...] "in one way it <b>does.</b> <b>My</b> eyes are constantly wide {{open to the}} extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{decreased}} European radio support, [...] "Honey" [...] {{managed to}} chart {{in several countries}} within the continent. The song debuted and peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart for the issue dated September 5, 1998.

Outside of Europe, [...] "Honey" [...] peaked at number 49 on the United States Billboard Dance/Electronic Singles Sales chart {{in conjunction with the}} single [...] "Run On" [...] and at number 56 in Australia.

500|$|Although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, he criticized it for {{including}} seven new songs and just nine hits. According to him, {{if it had been a}} straight hits collection, with [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] added to the end, it would have been fine, but padding it with nearly a full album worth of new material hurts it. He also noticed that Dion's first American hit, [...] "Where <b>Does</b> <b>My</b> Heart Beat Now", isn't here, nor is her duet with Barbra Streisand, [...] "Tell Him". Erlewine stated that the best of the hits, like the Meat Loaf-ian epic [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] and [...] "My Heart Will Go On", are certainly among the best adult contemporary songs of the decade. In comparison to the new material, he felt that the danceable [...] "That's the Way It Is" [...] and the [...] "pretty" [...] ballad [...] "If Walls Could Talk" [...] work, but he did not like [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" [...] and [...] "All the Way". According to him, the remaining three new songs [...] "aren't bad", but they're not particularly memorable, especially compared to the hits.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Dion {{made her}} debut into the American market with Unison. The album {{included}} [...] "Where <b>Does</b> <b>My</b> Heart Beat Now", which became her first single {{to reach the}} top ten on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number four. In 1991, Dion sang with Peabo Bryson in the song [...] "Beauty and the Beast". It became her second top ten Billboard Hot 100 single, first top ten entry in the United Kingdom, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Her following single from Celine Dion, [...] "If You Asked Me To" [...] peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the chart in Canada. Released in late 1993, The Colour of My Love spawned Dion's first US and Australian, and second Canadian number-one single, [...] "The Power of Love". In the United States, the song was certified platinum and has sold 1.5 million copies. Another single from The Colour of My Love, [...] "Think Twice" [...] topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has sold over 1.3 million copies there. It became only the fourth million-selling single ever in the UK by a female artist. [...] "Think Twice" [...] also topped the charts in other European countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it <b>does</b> <b>my</b> head in every time I see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the bulk}} of the songs on Till I Loved You, [...] "What Were We Thinking Of" [...] is a [...] "nontheatrical pop song". According to the {{official}} sheet music published by the Warner Music Group, the song is written in the key of B major with a moderately fast beat consisting of 138 beats per minute. Since Till I Loved You is a concept album based on the beginnings and ends of relationships, [...] "What Were We Thinking Of" [...] was placed {{towards the end of the}} album's track listing where the accompanying songs' lyrics discuss break-ups and how to move on in life from them. Streisand sings, [...] "Where did we go wrong? Is it really over? / Where <b>does</b> <b>my</b> heart belong if it's not with you?". To accompany the production, a number of instruments are present on the track, including a saxophone played by Dave Boruff, a guitar played by Michael Thompson, and drums played by Randy Waldman and Cutler.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{opened on}} 17 January 1904, the director's birthday, at the Moscow Art Theatre under the {{direction}} of the actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski. During rehearsals, the structure of Act Two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov's wishes, Stanislavski's version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had [...] "ruined" [...] his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone... Not once <b>does</b> <b>my</b> Anya cry, nowhere do I speak of a tearful tone, in the second act there are tears in their eyes, but the tone is happy, lively. Why did you speak in your telegram about so many tears in my play? Where are they? ... Often you will find the words [...] "through tears," [...] but I am describing only the expression on their faces, not tears. And in the second act there is no graveyard." [...] The playwright's wife Olga Knipper played Madame Ranevskaya in the original Moscow Art Theatre production, as well as in the 300th production of the play by the theatre in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>my</b> son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that <b>does</b> <b>my</b> head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and <b>does</b> <b>my</b> head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
