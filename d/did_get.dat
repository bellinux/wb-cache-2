5|$|Benchley had {{continued}} to receive positive responses from his performing, and in 1925 he accepted a standing invitation from film producer Jesse L. Lasky for a six-week term writing screenplays at $500. While the session did not yield significant results, Benchley <b>did</b> <b>get</b> writing credit for producing the title cards on the Raymond Griffith silent film You'd Be Surprised (released September 1926), and was invited to do some titling for two other films.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{began his}} collegiate {{career as a}} {{baseball}} and football player at the University of Illinois, but transferred to the University of Evansville after one year. At Evansville he was an All-American twotimes but had to transfer due to the school dropping football as a sport. Bennett then attended Northwestern University {{where he was a}} fullback and was mainly a blocker but <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a few rushing attempts.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it <b>did</b> <b>get</b> cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|Bär's 204th and 205th victories, {{against two}} Hawker Typhoons, were {{achieved}} on 1 January 1945 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte, a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the Benelux area. The operation resulted {{in hundreds of}} aircraft losses on both sides. Bär's JG3 contributed by raiding Eindhoven in the Netherlands, shooting down about six RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground. One of Bär's 'aerial kills' {{may not have been}} airborne. Historian Norman Franks states both aircraft, from No. 438 Squadron RAF, were taxiing when hit. Flight Lieutenant Pete Wilson was wounded and later died from his injuries after Bär's strafing attack. The second Typhoon <b>did</b> <b>get</b> airborne. Its pilot, Flight Officer Ross Keller was killed. This version of events is contradicted by a witness, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both aircraft were airborne.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 he had {{a highly}} publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, in which he protested Wilson's {{introduction}} of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie The Birth of a Nation, which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms. He {{was not able to}} influence the peace talks at the end of World War I, and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with Roman Catholics, in 1921 he <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a revival screening banned of The Birth of a Nation. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 he was {{selected}} for the domestic series against Fiji and later that year again toured New Zealand with the Wallabies. He played in nine of Australia's ten tour matches in New Zealand. The Wallabies lost only two of their matches, a game against Southland, and their second Test against the All Blacks. In the first Test Windon harassed the New Zealand fly-half with his aggressive defence, and pounced on a loose ball to score a try after the ball was dropped following a mistimed All Blacks' back-line move. The New Zealanders adjusted to Australia's tactics to win the second Test 15–8, but Windon <b>did</b> <b>get</b> the consolation of another try.|$|E
5|$|The 0–14 {{record was}} {{matched by the}} 1980 New Orleans Saints, who won their {{penultimate}} game to end the season 1–15. The 1981 Baltimore Colts then won their opener and closer, but lost every game in between to equal the Buccaneers’ and Saints’ 14-game single-season losing streak. The 1982 Colts were winless in a strike-shortened season, but <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a tie in one game. The 1990 New England Patriots had a 1–1 record when several of the players sexually harassed a female reporter. The fallout from the scandal contributed to the team finishing 0–14 in its remaining games. The 2013 Houston Texans also managed to match the Buccaneers' single-season losing streak after starting 2–0. Most recently, the 2016 Cleveland Browns lost their first 14 games (including an 0–4 preseason) to match the Buccaneers' single season streak, but managed to avoid becoming the NFL's second 0–16 team by winning their penultimate game against the San Diego Chargers.|$|E

5|$|The local batsmen {{were unable}} to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his {{opponent}} had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.N- However, he was often effective when he <b>did</b> <b>get</b> an opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos <b>did</b> <b>get</b> Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, to the effect that it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans <b>did</b> <b>get</b> through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try.|$|E

5|$|The first Test {{match of}} the tour, on 24 December 1949 at Johannesburg, saw him score 14runs {{in the first}} innings before falling leg before wicket (LBW) to Cuan McCarthy, and taking three catches as South Africa were forced to follow on, Australia winning by an innings and 85 runs. In the Second Test at Cape Town, Saggers <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a chance to bat, with Australia declaring for 526 before he had the {{opportunity}} in the first innings. South Africa were forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and were defeated by eight wickets. He did, however, complete three stumpings in South Africa's first innings off the bowling of Colin McCool, along with four catches in the match. He also took two catches and completed one stumping in the Third Test, and made two runs in the first innings, {{though he did not}} bat in the second as Australia won by five wickets. The Fourth Test, again in Johannesburg, saw Saggers score five not out in the first innings and, though not being required to bat in the second innings as the match ended in a draw, taking two catches.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction <b>did</b> <b>get</b> completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally <b>did</b> <b>get</b> across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had {{allowed in the}} previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. Penn State, though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to Allen Robinson, and ultimately {{was faced with a}} fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7–0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21–14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. Penn State earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, Penn State led 24–14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. Penn State started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting Penn State up by three possessions, 31–14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but Penn State recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31–21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and Penn State had to throw the ball, and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. Penn State got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they <b>did</b> <b>get</b> into Penn State territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31–24.|$|E
