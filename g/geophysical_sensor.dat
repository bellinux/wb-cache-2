40|$|This {{document}} is a Final Technical Report {{that describes the}} results of the Geophex Airborne Unmanned Survey System (GAUSS) research project. The objectives were to construct a geophysical data acquisition system that uses a remotely operated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and to evaluate its effectiveness for characterization of hazardous environmental sites. The GAUSS is a data acquisition system that mitigates the potential risk to personnel during geophysical characterization of hazardous or radioactive sites. The fundamental basis of the GAUSS is as follows: (1) an unmanned survey vehicle carries <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensors</b> into a hazardous location, (2) the pilot remains outside the hazardous site and operates the vehicle using radio control, (3) geophysical measurements and their spatial locations are processed by an automated data-acquisition system which displays data on an off-site monitor in real-time, and (4) the pilot uses the display to direct the survey vehicle for complete site coverage. The objective of our Phase I research was to develop a data acquisition and processing (DAP) subsystem and <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensors</b> suitable for UAV deployment. We integrated these two subsystems to produce an automated, hand-held geophysical surveying system. The objective of the Phase II effort was to modify the subsystems and integrate them into an airborne prototype. The completed GAUSS DAP system consists of a UAV platform, a laser tracking and ranging subsystem, a telemetry subsystem, light-weight <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensors,</b> a base-station computer (BC), and custom-written survey control software (SCS).

They provide large amounts and different types of data which need to be combined. An integrated approach, using multivariate geostatistical data-fusion techniques and multi-source <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> data to determine simple summary scale-dependent indices, is described here. These indices {{can be used to}} delineate management zones to be submitted to differential management. Such a data fusion approach with geophysical sensors was applied in a soil of an agronomic field cropped with tomato.

Comparing this partition with the soil properties measured with a shallow sampling, it was possible to verify the coherence in the topsoil between the dielectric properties and other properties more directly related to agronomic management.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{philosophy}} of Precision Agriculture (PA) {{is the concept of}} matching inputs to needs. Recent research in PA has focused on use of Management Zones (MZ) that are field areas characterised by homogeneous attributes in landscape and soil conditions. Proximal sensing (such as Electromagnetic Induction (EMI), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and X-ray fluorescence) can complement direct sampling and a multisensory platform can enable us to map soil features unambiguously. Several methods of multi-sensor data analysis have been developed to determine the location of subfield areas. Modern geostatistical techniques, treating variables as continua in a joint attribute and geographic space, offer the potential to analyse such data effectively. The objective of the paper is to show the potential of multivariate geostatistics to create MZ in the perspective of PA by integrating field data from different types of sensors, describing two study cases. In particular, in the first case study, cokriging and factorial cokriging were employed to produce thematic maps of soil trace elements and to delineate homogenous zones, respectively. In the second case, a multivariate geostatistical data-fusion technique (multi collocated cokriging) was applied to different <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> data (GPR and EMI), for stationary estimation of soil water content and for delineating within-field zone with different wetting degree.

In addition due to technological advances new trains are increasingly fast. This fact requires an improvement to the construction as well as to maintenance operations of railway systems. Knowledge of applying <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> techniques on pavements was transferred to railways by taking advantage of the ability of ground penetrating radar to map substructure conditions on a continuous non-destructive basis. The study examines pilot sections, which are integrated in the National Railway System of Greece and are representative of the Greek Railways regarding structural and operational elements. For the present study a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system as well as the Videocar of the National Technical University of Athens have been used. The GPR system consists of an air-coupled 1 GHz frequency antenna and a ground coupled 400 MHz antenna. Data was acquired between concrete and wood ties as well as from the ballast shoulders beyond the ends of the ties, using the two antennas with multiple antenna orientations and polarizations. Automatic processing of the data was developed to quickly generate hard copy sections of radar images. Substructure conditions were observed such as thickness of the ballast and sub ballast layers, variations in layer thickness along the track, pockets of water trapped in the ballast, and soft subgrades from high water content. In addition, locations and depths of subsurface drainage pipes, trenches, and utilities were quickly and continuously mapped. In addition to in-situ measurements a Global Position System (GPS) was used in order to record exact coordinates of the sections under study. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E

Technologies are needed which will allow for cost effective wide area scanning with (1) near 100 % coverage and (2) near 100 % detection of subsurface ordnance or features indicative of subsurface ordnance. The current approach to wide area assessment is a multi-level one, in which medium - altitude fixed wing optical imaging is used for an initial site assessment. This assessment is followed with low altitude manned helicopter based magnetometry. Subsequent to this wide area assessment targeted surface investigations are performed using either towed <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays or man portable sensors. In order to be an effective tool for small UXO detection, the sensing altitude for magnetic site investigations needs to be on the order of 1 to 3 meters. These altitude requirements mean that manned helicopter surveys will generally only be feasible in large, open and relatively flat terrains. While such surveys are effective in mapping large areas relatively fast there are substantial mobilization/demobilization, staffing and equipment costs associated with these surveys, resulting in costs of approximately $ 100 -$ 150 /acre.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project are to construct a <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> system based on a remotely operated model helicopter (ROH) and to evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} system for characterization of hazardous environmental sites. Geophex Airborne Unmanned Survey System (GAUSS) is a geophysical survey system that uses a ROH as the survey vehicle. We have selected the ROH because of its advantages over fixed wing and ground based vehicles. Lower air speed and superior maneuverability of the ROH make it better suited for geophysical surveys than a fixed wing model aircraft. The ROH can fly close to the ground, allowing detection of weak or subtle anomalies. Unlike ground based vehicles, the ROH can traverse difficult terrain while providing a stable sensor platform. ROH does not touch the ground {{during the course of a}} survey and is capable of functioning over water and surf zones. The ROH has been successfully used in the motion picture industry and by geology companies for payload bearing applications. The only constraint to use of the airborne system is that the ROH must remain visible to the pilot. Obstructed areas within a site can be characterized by relocating the base station to alternate positions. GAUSS consists of a ROH with radio controller, a data acquisition and processing (DAP) system, and lightweight digital sensor systems. The objective of our Phase I research was to develop a DAP and sensors suitable for ROH operation. We have constructed these subsystems and integrated them to produce an automated, hand-held geophysical surveying system, referred to as the ``pre-prototype``.

Recent {{years have seen}} enormous growth in collection and curation of datasets in various domains which often involve thousands or even millions of variables. Examples include social networking websites, <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensor</b> networks, cancer genomics, climate science, and many more. In many applications, it is of prime interest to understand the dependencies between variables, such that predictive models may be designed from knowledge of such dependencies. However, traditional statistical methods, such as least squares regression, are often inapplicable for such tasks, since the available sample size is much smaller than problem dimensionality. Therefore we require new models and methods for statistical data analysis which provide provable estimation guarantees even in such high dimensional scenarios. Further, we also require that such models provide efficient implementation and optimization routines. Statistical models which satisfy both these criteria will be important for solving prediction problems in many scientific domains. High dimensional statistical models have attracted interest from both the theoretical and applied machine learning communities in recent years. Of particular interest are parametric models, which considers estimation of coefficient vectors in the scenario where sample size is {{much smaller than the}} dimensionality of the problem. Although most existing work focuses on analyzing sparse regression methods using L 1 norm regularizers, there exist other ``structured'' norm regularizers that encode more interesting structure in the sparsity induced on the estimated regression coefficients. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we conduct a theoretical study of such structured regression methods. First, we prove statistical consistency of regression with hierarchical tree-structured norm regularizer known as hiLasso. Second, we formulate a generalization of the popular Dantzig Selector for sparse linear regression to any norm regularizer, called Generalized Dantzig Selector, and provide statistical consistency guarantees of estimation. Further, we provide the first known results on non-asymptotic rates of consistency for the recently proposed $k$-support norm regularizer. Finally, we show that in the presence of measurement errors in covariates, the tools we use for proving consistency in the noiseless setting are inadequate in proving statistical consistency. In the second part of the thesis, we consider application of regularized regression methods to statistical modeling problems in climate science. First, we consider application of Sparse Group Lasso, a special case of hiLasso, for predictive modeling of land climate variables from measurements of atmospheric variables over oceans. Extensive experiments illustrate that structured sparse regression provides both better performance and more interpretable models than unregularized regression and even unstructured sparse regression methods. Second, we consider application of regularized regression methods for discovering stable factors for predictive modeling in climate. Specifically, we consider the problem of determining dominant factors influencing winter precipitation over the Great Lakes Region of the US. Using a sparse linear regression method, followed by random permutation tests, we mine stable sets of predictive features from a pool of possible predictors. Some of the stable factors discovered through this process are shown to relate to known physical processes influencing precipitation over Great Lakes...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} and characterization of buried objects and materials {{is an important}} step in the restoration of burial sites containing chemical and radioactive waste materials at Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense (DOD) facilities. By performing these tasks with remotely controlled sensors, it is possible to obtain improved data quality and consistency as well as enhanced safety for on-site workers. Therefore, the DOE Office of Technology Development and the US Army Environmental Center have jointly supported the development of the Remote Characterization System (RCS). One of the main components of the RCS is a small remotely driven survey vehicle that can transport various combinations of <b>geophysical</b> and radiological <b>sensors.</b> Currently implemented sensors include ground-penetrating radar, magnetometers, an electromagnetic induction sensor, and a sodium iodide radiation detector. The survey vehicle was constructed predominantly of non-metallic materials to minimize its effect on the operation of its <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensors.</b> The system operator controls the vehicle from a remote, truck-mounted, base station. Video images are transmitted to the base station by a radio link to give the operator necessary visual information. Vehicle control commands, tracking information, and sensor data are transmitted between the survey vehicle and the base station by means of a radio ethernet link. Precise vehicle tracking coordinates are provided by a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) ...|$|R
40|$|Incorrectly {{oriented}} <b>geophysical</b> <b>sensors</b> affect {{data analysis}} procedures, {{which can lead}} to errors in results and interpretations. These problems generally occur in applications, in which the orientation of the sensor cannot be actively controlled and is not known a priori. Common examples are sensors deployed in borehole installations or on the seafloor. We introduce two methods to optimally correct data sets from misaligned two- and three-component sensors. Firstly, we demonstrate how a set of multiple twocomponent sensors can be re-oriented in a single step calculation. In the second part, we introduce a quaternion-based analytical method for the calculation of the optimal re-orientation of three-component sensors. A common approach to the re-orientation of three-component data is to assume that the vertical axis {{does not have to be}} corrected during the processing. We show, that this approximation can lead to significant deviations between re-oriented data and original data. Therefore, the estimation of not only an optimal rotation angle, but also the rotation axis can help to mitigate a systematic source of error in the processing of geophysical data.
