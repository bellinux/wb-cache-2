50|$|Bit.Trip Beat was {{developed}} by Gaijin Games and initially published by Aksys Games. It was designed by Alex Neuse, its art by Mike Roush, and its programming by Chris Osborn. Their publishing agreement with Aksys was formed due to Neuse's personal relationship with its president, Akibo Shieh, with whom {{the two of them}} had wanted to work on a game together before. Despite the amicable relationship with Aksys, the budget and development time were less than they would have wanted, though they put up with it due to their good relationship and the challenge of developing with those limits. Because of being only three people, the developers had to do more than what they normally would have to. Before its reveal, Gaijin released a teaser on IGN. Its title was originally 8-Bit Beat, though this was changed to Bit.Trip Beat. Early on, the developers could only afford one development kit, causing them to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> each other's work to use it. One of the first ideas made for the game was to give it an Atari 2600 art style.|$|E
5000|$|In 1846, Darwin rented from Sir John William Lubbock {{a narrow}} strip of land of 1.5 acre {{adjoining}} the Down House grounds to the southwest, and had it planted. He named it the Sandwalk Wood. One side was shaded by an old shaw with oak trees, and the other looked over a hedge to a charming valley. Darwin had a variety of trees planted, and ordered a gravel path known as the [...] "sandwalk" [...] to be created around the perimeter. Darwin's daily walk of several circuits of this path served both for exercise and for uninterrupted thinking. He set up {{a number of small}} stones at one point on the walk so that he could kick a stone to the side each time he passed, so that he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> his thoughts by consciously counting the number of circuits he had made that day. The sandwalk also served as a playground for his children. A wooden summerhouse was built {{at the lower end of}} the sandwalk. In 1874, Darwin gave a piece of pasture land to Sir John Lubbock (the son) in exchange for ownership of the Sandwalk Wood. From 1849 Darwin used it to continue his walking exercise on return from Dr. Gully's hydrotherapy treatment.|$|E

Veterinarians arrived at the temple at 08:50 on 26 July accompanied by police and other officials, but without a cattle truck to remove Shambo. They were refused entry by the monks {{because they had no}} warrant, and left to obtain one from a local magistrate. A warrant could not be issued until they had been refused entry, according to The Guardian.

At about 4:00 pm, police used bolt cutters to get through the gate and move their vehicles - including an animal trailer and four riot vans. The bull was removed from the site at around 7:25 pm, after protesters had been removed, who had come from as far away as New Zealand and Switzerland. The animal was taken to a local abattoir for slaughter. Officials confirmed on 27 July that Shambo had been slaughtered.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the arrival}} of PUs or {{performance}} degradation on serving channel, SUs may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> their current transmission and conduct spectrum handoff, i.e., switching to another spectrum belonging to the same or different CRNs.

While most of previous research works study spectrum handoff problem or resource allocation problem independently, these two problems are indeed closely related especially under the scenario that multiple SUs may conduct spectrum handoff simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) {{transmission}} systems using Voltage-Source Converters (VSC) are {{widely recognized as}} offering significant potential for long distance high power delivery, particularly for offshore wind farm connections. One of the barriers {{for the development of}} multi-terminal HVDC systems is the lack of technologies which enable direct fault isolation. This paper will investigate DC fault current limiting technology to reduce fault currents to acceptable levels allowing DC circuit breakers to operate quickly and reliably. Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL) are a promising candidate, satisfying most of the ideal fault current limitation requirements. This paper shows the potential for reducing the fault current to more acceptable levels using SFCLs in VSC-HVDC systems. A summary of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} resistive and inductive SFCLs is also given. An SFCL limits DC fault current very effectively, reducing the fault current the HVDC circuit breaker would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt.</b> The paper includes a detailed analysis of resistive and inductive SFCLs including aspects of practical design for use in commercial VSC-HVDC systems. Finally, key issues such as cryogenic cooling and superconducting material costs are highlighted...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{research}} studies [2 â 6] mainly focus on designing spectrum handoff scheme for single SU in CRNs; however, {{it is highly}} possible that multiple SUs may have to perform spectrum handoff at the same time. For instance, multiple SUs occupying the licensed channel of one PU may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> their transmission and switch to other channels due {{to the arrival of}} the PU. The spectrum handoff problem of multiple SUs has been studied in [7, 8]. The authors in [7] assume that the spectrum handoff of SUs should meet the constraint of handoff agility, i.e., SUs are only allowed to switch to their neighboring channels, and then formulate a continuous-time Markov model to analyze the forced termination and blocking probabilities of SUs. In [8], an analytical framework is presented to examine the impact of common control interface (CCI) on the performance of spectrum handoff. The potential benefits and disadvantages of employing CCI for spectrum handoff are analyzed in terms of handoff delay, energy consumption, and spectrum utilization. Although [7, 8] stress the problem of spectrum handoff of multiple SUs, they mainly study the performance evaluation of handoff scheme instead of optimal handoff scheme design.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are a}} number of issues with 911 calls that make them a less than ideal source for {{linguistic}} analysis. First, these calls can be very short. In the dataset used for this study, calls ranged from less than thirty seconds to over ten minutes in length. On average, the calls were about three to four minutes. Another problem is that there can be a lot of dead air time while the 911 operator puts the caller on hold to coordinate with the rest of the emergency team; such gaps cannot be used in linguistic analyses. Third the sound quality of the calls can make them difficult to transcribe. Fourth, dispatchers, operators, callers, and rescue workers may talk simultaneously. Fifth, certain sounds such as sobs, shrieks, or gasps of pain cannot be easily transcribed and/or analyzed using current linguistic feature dictionaries. Finally, a caller may be poised to offer what could prove to be valuable clues to future investigators, but 911 operators may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> them to elicit the best information for timely dispatching of the right resources. Consequently, to accomplish their primary mission, the operators who perform both call-taking and dispatching functions may restrict âtellingâ cues or information [32].|$|E
40|$|Birds {{breeding}} in cold environments regularly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> incubation to forage, {{causing a}} trade-off between two mutually exclusive behaviours. Earlier {{studies showed that}} uniparental Arctic sandpipers overall spend less time incubating their eggs than biparental species, but interspecific differences in size and ecology were potential confounding factors. This study reports on a within-species comparison of breeding schedules and metal egg temperatures in uni- and biparental sanderlings (Calidris alba) in Northeast Greenland in relation to ambient temperature. We recorded incubation schedules with nest temperature loggers in 34 sanderling clutches (13 uniparentals, 21 biparentals). The temperature of a metal egg placed within the clutch of 17 incubating birds (6 uniparentals, 9 biparentals) was measured {{as an indicator of}} the heat put into eggs. Recess frequency, recess duration and total recess time were higher in uniparentals than in biparentals and positively correlated with ambient temperatures in uniparentals only. Uniparental sanderlings maintained significantly higher metal egg temperatures during incubation than biparentals (1. 4 Â°C difference on average). Our results suggest that uniparental sanderlings compensate for the lower nest attendance, which may prolong the duration of the incubation period and negatively affect the condition of the hatchlings, by maintaining a higher heat flux into the eggs. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{different}} situations in which collaborative agents have to communicate among themselves using standard interaction protocols. We will propose how to process these interactions in par-allel without interfering with other agentâs activities. Thus, agents will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> or delay an activity for handling incoming messages, and in some cases, answers can be created and delivered immedi-ately. Our proposal will be oriented to a robotic soccer domain with autonomous mobile robots. We will ana-lyze three kinds of situations in which the interaction between agents {{plays an important role}} for coordina-tion: requirements, queries and proposals. Require-ments arise when an agent asks another to execute a specific action. A query is used when an agent wants to acquire certain information from another agent. Finally, proposals arise when an agent wants to syn-chronize with another agent for collaboration. In a realistic scenario, an agent may interact with several agents and these interactions usually proceed simultaneously {{with the rest of the}} activities of the agent. Therefore, our proposal is to process these in-teractions in parallel with the decision cycle of the agent reducing the overhead imposed by the interac-tion. The implementation of this approach will be done in an extended logic programming framework developed for implementing multi-agent systems...|$|E
