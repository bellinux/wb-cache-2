500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a <b>decentralised</b> <b>system</b> in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Quorum sensing can {{function}} as a collective decision-making process in any <b>decentralised</b> <b>system.</b> A quorum response {{has been defined as}} [...] "a steep increase in the probability of group members performing a given behaviour once a threshold minimum number of their group mates already performing that behaviour is exceeded". A recent investigation showed that small groups of fish used consensus decision-making when deciding which fish model to follow. The fish did this by a simple quorum rule such that individuals watched the decisions of others before making their own decisions. This technique generally resulted in the 'correct' decision but occasionally cascaded into the 'incorrect' decision. In addition, as the group size increased, the fish made more accurate decisions in following the more attractive fish model. Consensus decision-making, a form of collective intelligence, thus effectively uses information from multiple sources to generally reach the correct conclusion. Such behaviour has also been demonstrated in the shoaling behaviour of threespine sticklebacks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the plan was {{explained}} in Der Weltkrieg by showing that command in the German armies was often conducted with vague knowledge of {{the circumstances of the}} French, the intentions of other commanders and the locations of other German units. Communication was botched from the start and orders could take hours or days to reach units or never arrive. Auftragstaktik, the <b>decentralised</b> <b>system</b> of command that allowed local commanders discretion within the commander's intent, operated at the expense of co-ordination. Aerial reconnaissance had more influence on decisions than was sometimes apparent in writing on the war but it was a new technology, the results of which could contradict reports from ground reconnaissance and be difficult for commanders to resolve. It always seemed that the German armies were on the brink of victory, yet the French kept retreating too fast for the German advance to surround them or cut their lines of communication. Decisions to change direction or to try to change a local success into a strategic victory, were taken by army commanders ignorant of their part in the OHL plan, which frequently changed. Der Weltkrieg portrays Moltke (the Younger) in command of a war machine [...] "on autopilot", with no mechanism of central control.|$|E

To achieve a better compliance, technological as well as institutional approaches seem to be necessary. First, technologies of treatment plants, process control and maintenance should be optimized. Second, governmental controlling institutions must be adjusted. On the one hand, {{this is due to the}} increasing number of autonomous stakeholders involved. On the other hand, this is caused by the public good character of waste water treatment once it exceeds the basic needs of households. Thus, easy riding of households occurs.

60|$|That the secession of the American colonies was a stupendous crisis, Mr. Seeley recognises, but his {{dislike of}} the idea that their example may be {{followed}} by other colonies seems to show that he does not agree with many of us as to the real significance of that great event. He admits, no doubt, that the American Union exerts a strong influence upon us by 'the strange career it runs and the novel experiments it tries.' These novel experiments in government, institutions, and social development, are the most valuable results, as many think, of the American state, and they are the results of its independence. Yet independence is what Mr. Seeley dreads for our present colonies, both for their own sake and ours. If any one thinks that America would be very much what she now is, if she had lost her battle a hundred years ago and had continued to be still attached to the English crown, though by a very slender link, he must be very blind to what has gone on in Australia.[2] The history of emigration in Canada, of transportation in New South Wales, and of the disastrous denationalisation of the land in Victoria, are useful illustrations of the difference between the experiments of a centralised compared with a <b>decentralised</b> <b>system</b> of government. Neither Australia nor Canada approached the United States in vigour, originality, and spirit, until, like the United States, they were left free to work out their own problems in their own way. It is not the republican form of government that has made all the difference, though that has had many most considerable effects. Independence not only put Americans on their mettle, but it left them with fresh views, with a temper of unbounded adaptability, with an infinite readiness to try experiments, and free room to indulge it as largely as ever they pleased. As Mr. Seeley says, the American Union 'is beyond question the state in which free will is most active and alive in every individual.' He says this, and a few pages further on he agrees that 'there has never been in any community so much happiness, or happiness of a kind so little demoralising, as in the United States.' But he proceeds to deny, not only that the causes of this happiness are political, but that it is in any great degree the consequence of secession. He seems to assume that if we accept the first proposition, the second follows. That is not the case. Secession was a political event, but it was secession that left unchecked scope and, more than that, gave a stimulus and an impulse such as nothing else could have given, to the active play and operation of all the non-political forces which Mr. Seeley describes, and which exist in much the same degree in the colonies that still remain to us. It is the value that we set on alacrity and freshness of mind that makes us distrust any project that interferes with the unfettered play and continual liveliness of what Mr. Seeley calls free will in these new communities, and makes us extremely suspicious of that 'clear and reasoned system,' whatever it may be, to which Mr. Seeley implores us all to turn our attention.|$|E

The use of <b>decentralised</b> water <b>systems</b> has introduced a change in the style of water service delivery and often there are new actors responsible and involved in the maintenance and operation of these systems. This raises questions about how to best implement and govern the use of <b>decentralised</b> water <b>systems.</b> To understand the issues and problem mitigation approaches required for <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems,</b> collection of data on the effectiveness, difficulties, functional aspects and ongoing problems in providing water services is required. Understanding the issues involved is not necessarily straightforward, as performance can be viewed from many different perspectives and may be difficult to measure. One key perspective to consider is that of householders, in their role as end-users of <b>decentralised</b> water <b>systems.</b> This paper suggests that dedicated household surveys can provide important information on the performance of <b>decentralised</b> water <b>systems</b> based on personal understanding and experience of these systems. This is stated on the basis of householder survey trials which indeed seem to provide useful information, both in terms of feedback from the individual and in generating a coherent data set from which to statistically model the adequacy of various implementation styles and governance structures.

The concepts of integrated urban water management and water sensitive urban design were prevalent in many of the innovative approaches used for the provision of decentralised urban water services. However, there remains a degree of confusion among water professionals in the terminology adopted for on-site and <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a literature review, consultation with water industry professionals and examination of decentralised urban developments in Australia, this paper has developed a generalised definition of <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems</b> for adoption across the water sector.

Considering the variety of sustainable factors, such as social, cultural, environmental, and technical factors, which {{must be taken into account}} to implement a wastewater treatment system, the financial aspect is often the most decisive factor in developing countries like Zimbabwe. This is the major reason why <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems</b> are considered as an alternative option. The United Nations (2015) argues in favour of <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems</b> in that treatment facilities can be built in a piece-meal manner and does not require multi-million dollar investments that is usually difficult to raise considering the financial constraints that burden local authorities in developing countries. However, in the majority of countries, there is a lack of suitable institutional arrangements for managing <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems</b> and a lack of a suitable policy framework that encourages a decentralised approach. Without technical assistance and other capacity-building measures, problems of institutional capacity that existed under a centralised operation are simply passed on to the new structures (Parkinson and Tayler 2003). For Harare, research and scientific work by responsible institutions is all aimed at improving the centralised wastewater systems, yet the developed world is increasingly shunning these methods.|$|R

Four cases of recent Australian urban water management improvement projects were researched using qualitative methods. Three cases were of decentralised water management innovation.

These cases were studied to identify institutional barriers and enablers for the uptake of <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems,</b> and to better understand how emerging environmental engineering knowledge might be applied to overcome an implementation gap for decentralised urban water technologies. Analysis of each case focused on the institutional elements of urban water management, namely: the values, knowledge frames and organisational structures. These elements were identified through in-depth interviews, document review, and an on-line survey. The alignment of these elements was identified as being a significant contributor to the stability of centralised systems, or to change toward <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems.</b> A new organisational home for innovative knowledge {{was found to be}} common to each case where decentralised innovation occurred. &# 145;Institutional entrepreneurs&# 146;, strong stakeholder engagement, and inter-organisational networks were all found to be linked to the creation of shared meaning and legitimacy for organisational and technological change.

A cultivated area where crops grew well was measured and taxed through fixed rates based on the area's crop and productivity.

It focuses principally on strategies and instruments for promoting consistency {{in the implementation of}} national environmental law. The report reviews in detail the experience of Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States and draws on examples from several other countries. Three programmatic elements of environmental enforcement are key to ensuring its consistency: the targeting of compliance monitoring; the selection of an enforcement instrument and the timeliness of noncompliance response; and the size of monetary penalties for non-compliance. Accurate and complete information on the performance of sub-national and local competent authorities is an important prerequisite for the evaluation of nationwide consistency of enforcement. To address these issues, OECD countries employ a range of mechanisms of institutional interaction: “vertical” (between different administrative levels) as well as “horizontal” (between competent authorities at the same level). The report presents multiple examples of the application of each mechanism in different <b>decentralised</b> <b>systems.</b> It analyses these good practices and suggests several ways to use them to ensure consistency in the implementation of the main elements of enforcement programmes. environmental enforcement, compliance assurance, environmental authorities, decentralised governance...|$|R
