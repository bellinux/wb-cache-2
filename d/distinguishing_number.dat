5000|$|Number {{and case}} are {{expressed}} using a single affix. A suffix {{is used for}} all cases except the comitative and associative, which are expressed using circumfixes.

The second class are proper names and kin terms for elders. They are second declension, and <b>distinguish</b> <b>number</b> in the ergative, locative, and lative cases, {{as well as the}} absolutive. The third class are the other human nouns; they may be either first or second declension.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{complete}} graph, the only distinguishing colorings assign {{a different color}} to each vertex.

5000|$|The exact {{complexity}} of computing distinguishing numbers is unclear, {{because it is}} closely related to the still-unknown {{complexity of}} graph isomorphism.

50|$|In graph theory, a {{distinguishing}} coloring or distinguishing {{labeling of}} a graph is an assignment of colors or labels to the vertices of the graph that destroys {{all of the}} nontrivial symmetries of the graph. The coloring {{does not need to}} be a proper coloring: adjacent vertices are allowed to be given the same color. For the colored graph, there should not exist any one-to-one mapping of the vertices to themselves that preserves both adjacency and coloring. The minimum number of colors in a distinguishing coloring is called the <b>distinguishing</b> <b>number</b> of the graph.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{stronger}} versions of Frucht's theorem {{that show that}} certain restricted families of graphs still contain enough graphs to realize any symmetry group. [...] proved that in fact countably many 3-regular graphs with the desired property exist; for instance, the Frucht graph, a 3-regular graph with 12 vertices and 18 edges, has no nontrivial symmetries, providing a realization of this type for the trivial group. [...] showed that any group can be realized as the symmetry groups of countably many distinct k-regular graphs, k-vertex-connected graphs, or k-chromatic graphs, for all positive integer values k (with k ≥ 3 for regular graphs and k ≥ 2 for k-chromatic graphs). From the facts that every graph can be reconstructed from the containment partial order of its edges and vertices, that every finite partial order is equivalent by Birkhoff's representation theorem to a finite distributive lattice, it follows that every finite group can be realized as the symmetries of a distributive lattice, and of the graph of the lattice, a median graph. It is possible to realize every finite group as the group of symmetries of a strongly regular graph. Every finite group can also be realized as the symmetries of a graph with <b>distinguishing</b> <b>number</b> two: one can (improperly) color the graph with two colors so {{that none of the}} symmetries of the graph preserve the coloring.|$|E
