40|$|Sadly, {{much of the}} {{original}} art of Aboriginal Australians is being lost {{as a result of}} exposure to adverse <b>environmental</b> conditions, <b>vandalism</b> and cultural disruption. Interpretation of the art sites, especially those on the east coast, is fragmented and may never be fully understood. What does remain is testament to a long and rich cultural identity that is just starting to infiltrate our stubborn European ethos. The vast majority of the drawings executed in the age of discovery and exploration of Terra Australis remain in museums around the world. Whether they were originally executed as an aid to military espionage, navigational charts, scientific documentation or the observations and jottings of untrained artists, these drawings recording Australia's unique landscapes, flora and fauna collectively represent the earliest European cultural history of Australia. Today all over the country organisations such as Rivercare and Landcare endeavour to moderate the exploitation of Australia's natural resources. The terms 'land literacy' and 'reading the land' attest to the importance of our need to comprehend and acknowledge {{what is happening in the}} natural world around us. Like many concerned about the fragility of our environment, I see the importance of community education in the monitoring and recording of the natural environment as an integral part in nurturing the land and ourselves and in the formulation and implementation of regional environmental strategies...|$|R
50|$|Outside the entrance, Henry Moore's {{heaviest}} bronze sculpture, Large Divided Oval: Butterfly (1985-86), {{stands in}} the middle of a circular basin. Weighing nearly nine tons, it was his final major work, completed just before he died. One of three public Moore sculptures in Berlin (the others being Three Way Piece No.2: The Archer (1964-65) at the Neue Nationalgalerie and Reclining Figure (1956) at the Akademie der Künste), Butterfly was initially a loan to (then West) Berlin in 1986, but the city council wanted the sculpture permanently, and asked Moore if he would donate it. The letter arrived just before his death and went unanswered. In 1988 it was sold by the Henry Moore Foundation to Berlin for 4.5 million Deutsche Mark (around $2.58 million at the exchange rate of the day), then a huge sum for a public sculpture. The sculpture was eventually badly damaged by a combination of <b>environmental</b> pollution and <b>vandalism,</b> and restored in 2010.|$|R
50|$|Her novels, {{taken from}} her {{experiences}} and travels around Australia, were written for children and young adults; however, they expressed many themes that have gained more prominence in today's world - such as the fragility and beauty {{of the environment and}} indigenous areas and the need for their conservation, the effect of ecological damage, the plight of refugees and societies disaffected and the human cost of resource development. As examples, Echo in the Wilderness, set on Lake Pedder on the eve of its destruction, chronicles the submergence and obliteration of the lake. Her 1983 book, I Will Not Say the Day Is Done (her only non-fiction/adult book) brought to life the struggle to save Lake Pedder. She was passionately consumed by the {{need to do something about}} <b>environmental</b> <b>vandalism</b> in Tasmania. Her book Isle of the Sea Horse, released in 1969, grew out of her concern about the ecological devastation to the Great Barrier Reef and, among other concerns, the plight of refugees. Her Longtime trilogy was set in, and inspired by her upbringing in, the Blue Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In the {{following}} policy perspective CEDA examines {{the environmental and}} economic issues associated with nuclear power and sets out a real options approach to enabling its future development. Australia 2 ̆ 7 s energy options Australia is at a critical moment in determining its energy future. Energy demand is forecast to rise substantially with continued economic and population growth while policy makers grapple with how to decarbonise the economy. Meanwhile, global growth in energy demand is causing ongoing price rises in commodities. Given the long lifecycle of energy investments, policy decisions made to address these challenges will determine Australia’s economic competitiveness for decades to come. The nuclear debate Nuclear power is widely used throughout the world and {{represents one of the}} most reliable means of replacing fossil fuels. Only hydropower displaces more carbon emissions than nuclear energy, and Australia is already utilising all its reasonable hydropower resources. To not consider the nuclear option when trying to decar- bonise the economy is tantamount to committing economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>vandalism.</b> Detractors of nuclear power may consider the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor as sufficient cause to ignore it. However, the Fukushima Daiichi reactor was of 1960 s vintage and modern reactor designs have passive safety features that preclude such a scenario occurring. Australia cannot afford to make policy decisions based on technology more than 40 years old. It would be equivalent to critiquing the rollout of the national broadband network based on assessments of the telegraph system. Concerns that exporting greater amounts of uranium will contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation are also groundless. Nuclear power has already achieved widespread deployment and the nuclear genie is well and truly out of the bottle. There is a substantial opportunity for Australia to play a more fundamental role in the global nuclear fuel cycle. Australia’s twin stabilities of political and geographic systems make it uniquely placed to hold nuclear waste material. This would not be a global dumping ground but a sophisticated storage facility of relatively little material. Furthermore, technological developments in nuclear reactors may result in future generators using the waste products of current reactors as fuel. Related identifier: ISBN 0 85801 277...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico (2010) and the {{resulting}} <b>environmental</b> <b>vandalism</b> and massive economical loss, highlight the engineering challenges in deep subsea operations. In Australia, 80 % of hydrocarbon reserve is located in frontier deep subsea regions. Safe and economical realisation of these resources requires innovative engineering solutions suitable for platform-free operations. Long and deep subsea pipelines can experience a number of structural instabilities such as lateral and upheaval buckling, spanning and buckle propagation. Among these, buckle propagation result in a catastrophic failure of {{a long stretch of}} the pipeline. A local buckle, ovalization, dent or corrosion in the pipe wall can quickly transform the pipe cross-section into a dumb-bell shape that travels along the pipeline as long as the external pressure is high enough to sustain propagation. The lowest pressure that maintains propagation is the propagation pressure which is {{only a small fraction of}} the elastic collapse pressure of the intact pipe. This results in a substantial increase in material and installation cost of the pipeline, since design is therefore governed by propagation pressure. A number of solutions to mitigate buckle propagation (and the necessary increase in wall-thickness were proposed such as buckle arrestors, pipe-in-pipe system, sandwich pipe system and ring-stiffened pipelines. This thesis investigates buckle propagation in deep subsea pipelines. An experimental work is conducted to determine buckle initiation and buckle propagation pressures in hyperbaric chamber test using aluminium and steel sample pipes with various diameter-to-thickness ratios (D/t). Intact and dented pipes are used in these tests to determine imperfection sensitivity of buckle propagation. Based on experimental observations, a modification to the available analytical solution of buckle propagation is proposed that accounts for circumferential bending as well as circumferential membrane actions. Nonlinear finite element (FE) modelling of the hyperbaric chamber tests was conducted and the predicted FE results of initiation and propagation pressures were verified against the experimental results. In order to increase the buckle propagation capacity and alleviate the inherent imperfection sensitivity, two issues that are relevant to deep subsea pipelines, a novel form of pipeline is proposed. The new form is a textured pipeline which is cylindrical in the global sense with local textured rather than smooth wall. Nonlinear FE analysis is used to evaluate the performance of textured pipeline. Based on obtained results, the textured pipeline offer superior performance in comparison to a conventional cylindrical pipe made of the same material and the same D/t ratio...|$|E
