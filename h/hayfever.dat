25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be <b>hayfever,</b> asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E

Individuals with rhinitis were identified by a postal screening questionnaire. Of the 2969 (39 %) subjects who replied, 1309 (44 %) reported rhinitis. A sample of 340 individuals with and 126 without rhinitis was studied, each being interviewed and having allergy skinprick tests. The information given at interview was compared with that recorded in the medical notes for 75 patients with rhinitis, selected at random to include 25 with seasonal symptoms only, 25 with perennial symptoms only, and 25 with both seasonal and perennial symptoms, plus 25 control subjects. <b>Hayfever</b> was defined as seasonal symptoms provoked by grass and a positive skin test response to grass pollen.

40|$|Background <b>Hayfever</b> affects {{at least}} one in 10 people. The {{majority}} of <b>hayfever</b> is managed in the community setting where the management options are pharmaceutical and behavioural. <b>Hayfever</b> medications are available over the counter and on prescription from the general practitioner. Patient information leaflets are published to augment the advice given and to promote self-management, but these leaflets have rarely been subjected to critical review. Objective To assess the quality of patient information leaflets written for people with <b>hayfever</b> and available from general practices and from community pharmacists. Method A structured review of patient information leaflets about <b>hayfever.</b> During the peak grass pollen season copies of all leaflets available were collected from {{a random sample of}} community pharmacists and general practices in Wessex. The characteristics of the leaflet were recorded and the contents and presentation of each one was reviewed using the British Medical Association patient information appraisal system. Readability was assessed using the Simple Measure of Gobbledegook (SMOG). Two allergy-accredited specialists assessed each leaflet for accuracy. Results During the peak pollen season no leaflets were available in 30 % of the Community Pharmacists and 23 % general practices. In total, 38 different leaflets were identified. All the leaflets reviewed were written for adults. Forty-seven percent of the leaflets had no publication date and one-third of those dated were at least 5 years old. In general the leaflets scored highly on issues of presentation, but less than half contained information on the full range of management and treatment options, many being biased towards a single or limited range of interventions. Seventy-nine percent leaflets were produced or sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and gave prominence to their own products. All the leaflets had readability scores requiring at least secondary education (SMOG score equal or greater than 9). At least one factual inaccuracy was identified in four-fifths of leaflets. Conclusion A large number of leaflets are published for people with <b>hayfever,</b> but they are of variable quality and not accessible to all patients because of limited distribution or high readability scores. If all patients are to benefit from written information the authors and publishers of leaflets need to follow published recommendations, especially with respect to content and readability. In the absence of a national public health information strategy or a body that systematically vets patient information materials, clinicians must pay attention to the quality of information provided for or obtained elsewhere by their patients...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} wide {{variation}} in the prevalence of nasal allergies internationally, {{the extent to which}} this is due to variation in etiological factors is not known. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to define the relative importance of atopy and other risk factors for nasal allergies, including <b>hayfever,</b> among young adults in Melbourne. The subjects were participants in the second phase of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey; 876 adults between 20 and 45 years of age completed a detailed respiratory questionnaire, 745 had skin prick testing with common aeroallergens and 675 underwent methacholine challenge. Total and allergen-specific IgE levels were measured in 701 and 693 subjects by radioimmunoassay and RAST, respectively. Nasal allergies, including <b>hayfever,</b> were reported by 47. 5 % of randomly selected participants. Females, non- smokers, subjects with a family history of allergies, those with current asthma, a history of eczema and nasal symptoms induced by dust, pollen or food were significantly more likely to have nasal allergies. Oral antihistamines had been used by 45. 7 % of those reporting nasal allergies and 12. 4 % had received allergen immunotherapy. The risk of nasal allergies, including <b>hayfever,</b> was increased 6. 1 -fold by atopy, particularly by positive skin tests to outdoor allergens such as Birch, Timothy grass, plantain, olive, Cladosporium and Rye grass pollen. Total serum IgE was significantly higher in subjects reporting nasal allergies than in those who did not report such allergies. There were significant trends in the prevalence of nasal allergies with increasing titers of specific IgE directed against all allergens tested. In conclusion, the significant independent risk factors for nasal allergies, including <b>hayfever,</b> in young adults were atopy, particularly sensitization to Timothy grass, house dust mites and plantain, current asthma, not smoking, a history of eczema and female gender. Future research needs to distinguish between <b>hayfever</b> and perennial allergic rhinitis, which was not possible in the present study...|$|E

Methods Parents of children with DM were requested by Dutch paediatricians to complete the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire on the prevalence of atopic diseases. A control group was derived from a Dutch cross-sectional survey (the ISAAC 2 study). Results We received 555 completed questionnaires, which is estimated to be 25 % {{of the total number of}} Dutch children with DM. The control group consisted of 777 children. After age-matching, the questionnaires of 188 DM patients were used. Symptoms of asthma, <b>hayfever</b> and eczema were reported less in the group of children with DM compared with the control group (wheeze last year, OR 0. 796, 95 % CI 0. 408 - 1. 554; <b>hayfever</b> symptoms last year, OR 0. 642, 95 % CI 0. 369 - 1. 118; eczema symptoms last year, OR 0. 693, 95 % CI 0. 430 - 1. 115). Conclusion The lower prevalence of astma, <b>hayfever</b> and eczema symptoms in DM patients compared with age-matched controls, although not statistically significant, is consistent with the Th 1 /Th 2 concep...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Seasonal {{allergic}} rhinitis (<b>hayfever)</b> is common and {{can contribute to}} a considerable reduction {{in the quality of}} life of adolescents. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of standardised allergy training for healthcare professionals in improving disease-specific quality of life in adolescents with <b>hayfever.</b> Methods/Design Adolescents with a history of <b>hayfever</b> registered in general practices in Scotland and England were invited to participate in a cluster randomised controlled trial. The unit of randomisation is general practices. The educational intervention for healthcare professionals consists of a short standardised educational course, which focuses on the management of {{allergic rhinitis}}. Patients in the intervention arm of this cluster randomised controlled trial will have a clinic appointment with their healthcare professional who has attended the training course. Patients in the control arm will have a clinic appointment with their healthcare professional and will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is the change in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardised Activities (RQLQ(S)) score between baseline and six weeks post-intervention in the patient intervention and control groups. Secondary outcome measures relate to healthcare professionals' understanding and confidence in managing allergic rhinitis, changes in clinical practice, numbers of consultations for <b>hayfever</b> and adolescent exam performance. A minimum of 11 practices in each arm of the trial (10 patients per cluster) will provide at least 80 % power to demonstrate a minimal clinically important difference of 0. 5 in RQLQ(S) score at a significance level of 5 % based on an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0. 02. Discussion At the time of submission, 24 general practices have been recruited (12 in each arm of the trial) and the interventions have been delivered. Follow-up data collection is complete. 230 children consented to take part in the trial; however complete primary outcome data are only available for 160. Further recruitment of general practices and patients will therefore take place in the summer of 2010. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 95538067 </p...|$|E
40|$|Mice models suggest {{epigenetic}} inheritance {{induced by}} parental allergic disease activity. However, we know little of how parental disease activity before conception influences offspring's asthma and allergy in humans.; We aimed {{to assess the}} associations of parental asthma severity, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and total and specific IgEs, measured before conception vs. after birth, with offspring asthma and hayfever.; The study included 4293 participants (mean age 34, 47 % men) from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) with information on asthma symptom severity, BHR, total and specific IgEs from 1991 to 1993, and data on 9100 offspring born 1972 - 2012. Adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRR) for associations of parental clinical outcome with offspring allergic disease were estimated with multinomial logistic regressions.; Offspring asthma with <b>hayfever</b> was more strongly associated with parental BHR and specific IgE measured before conception than after birth [BHR: aRRR = 2. 96 (95 % CI: 1. 92, 4. 57) and 1. 40 (1. 03, 1. 91), respectively; specific IgEs: 3. 08 (2. 13, 4. 45) and 1. 83 (1. 45, 2. 31), respectively]. This was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis of a subgroup of offspring aged 11 - 22 years with information on parental disease activity {{both before and after}} birth.; Parental BHR and specific IgE were associated with offspring asthma and <b>hayfever,</b> with the strongest associations observed with clinical assessment before conception as compared to after birth of the child. If the hypothesis is confirmed in other studies, parental disease activity assessed before conception may prove useful for identifying children at risk for developing asthma with <b>hayfever...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractBirth order, {{maternal}} age, gestational age, birth weight, maternal smoking, {{and social}} class {{have all been}} associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma in childhood, but the consistency of independent effects of these exposures in relation {{to all of these}} allergic conditions has not been investigated. We have compared and contrasted the independent effects of these putative risk factors on parent-reported <b>hayfever,</b> eczema and wheeze by age 16 years and in the past 12 months at age 16 using data from the 1970 British birth cohort. The 1970 British birth cohort comprised all children born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week of April 1970, and follow-up surveys at birth, 5, 10 and 16 years of age involved a cumulative total of 17 427 children. We have used data on over 6000 children with complete data at every stage. Social advantage was a risk factor common to each of wheeze at, and <b>hayfever</b> and eczema at and by age 16. Low birth order was an independent risk factor for eczema and <b>hayfever</b> at age 16, but not for wheeze. However, wheeze at age 16 was significantly increased in relation to maternal smoking, with a significant interaction such that the effect of smoking was greatest in those of high birth order and, in the absence of maternal smoking, low birth order was a risk factor for wheeze at age 16. Social advantage and low birth order appear to be the independently consistent determinants of atopic disease. Maternal smoking is an additional risk factor for wheeze, which applies primarily in low socioeconomic groups...|$|E
