40|$|In {{spite of}} the EU {{directives}} that regulate meat inspection for bovine cysticercosis, Taenia saginata is still present in Europe and causes economic losses due to condemnation, refrigeration and downgrading of infected carcasses. The main reasons for this persistence include the low sensitivity of current meat inspection protocols, the dissemination and survival of eggs in the environment and cattle husbandry systems, which allow grazing on pastures and drinking from water streams. It is assumed that water streams and surface water are potentially contaminated with T. saginata eggs. Furthermore, current wastewater management not only fails to halt, but rather contributes to the dissemination of eggs in the environment. Here, the authors discuss an integrated approach for control of this <b>food-borne</b> <b>zoonosis,</b> {{as well as the}} potential use of serological methods as a way of improving detection of bovine cysticercosis...|$|E

It has a complex life cycle involving at least two intermediate hosts, with humans being accidental hosts in which the larvae cannot reach sexual maturity. The main risks for acquisition are consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish and geographical exposure. Infection results in initial nonspecific symptoms followed by cutaneous and/or visceral larva migrans, with the latter carrying high morbidity and mortality rates if there is central nervous system involvement.

She was successfully treated with albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 21 days) and showed complete and permanent resolution of the lesions. A 41 -year-old woman had two months of intermittent migratory swellings in the trunk, face, and limbs associated with erythema, pruritus, and pain. The skin lesions were recurrent, typically lasting 1 – 2 weeks before spontaneous res-olution. She denied fever, chills, or other clinical signs. She reported regular consumption of undercooked raw fish and shellfish. Physical examination showed palpable, non-pitting swelling in the right arm (Figure 1) and left leg, this leg showed subcutaneous hemorrhage (Figure 2). Laboratory analysis showed moderate eosinophilia (960 cells/mm 3). The triad of eosinophilia, migratory lesions (nodular panniculitis), and raw fish consumption was highly suggestive of cutane-ous gnathostomiasis.

40|$|Introduction Y. enterocolitica is the causative {{agent of}} {{yersiniosis}} – a foodborne zoonosis with substantial importance to public health. Y. enterocolitica is {{widespread in the}} environment and animal populations, posing a potential source of infection to humans. Objective. Presentation of yersiniosis as a zoonotic foodborne disease of relevance to public health. State of knowledge Swine {{play an important role}} as a reservoir of Y. enterocolitica and insufficiently thermally processed pork is the main source of infection to humans. The correlation between strains isolated from pigs and from clinical cases of human yersiniosis has been sufficiently proven. Yersiniosis usually appears with gastrointestinal disturbances in children, whereas in adults it manifests in a pseudo-appendix form. The extra-enteric form of yersiniosis is rare. Classical bacteriological methods used for classifying Y. enterocolitica as pathogenic {{does not take into account}} the new aspects of the pathogenesis of yersiniosis. The examples are biotype 1 A strains, commonly regarded as non-pathogenic, although they are increasingly often isolated from clinical cases of yersiniosis. Molecular methods seem much more effective and accurate in the diagnostic. New diagnostic tools such as real-time PCR, allows not only qualitative examination, but also quantitative evaluation of genes expression level, or single nucleotide polymorphism detection. Conclusions Yersiniosis is an important <b>food-borne</b> <b>zoonosis</b> with wide range of clinical symptoms. Considering the fact that pork is the main source of infection for humans, public information campaigns seems to be an important element of the preventive measures against Y. enterocolitica infections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Trichinellosis is a <b>food-borne</b> {{parasitic}} <b>zoonosis</b> with {{a yearly}} incidence of about 10, 000 clinical cases worldwide. It {{is one of}} the most serious zoonotic diseases in Romania with more than 28, 000 human cases reported over the last 25 years. Trichinella species and genotypes are present on all continents, from the tropical regions to the cold ones. Up to date, there have been identified four Trichinella species in Europe: T. spiralis, T. nativa, T. britovi and T. pseudospiralis. In order to identify a genetic variability in ecologically distinct species of Trichinella, which may lead to a potential geographical disposition of Trichinella isolates, we test the variability of nine nuclear microsatellite loci, in a small population of Trichinella isolates of Romania. As a result, we obtained a positive amplification for most of the microsatellites studied for Trichinella strains belonging to different species (T. spiralis, T. britovi). We noticed a size-difference between the amplicons generated by the DNA of various Trichinella species (T. spiralis vs T. britovi). We identify a genetic variability inside the same Trichinella population (T. spiralis), differentiating 3 strains (7. 97, 7. 42, 7. 29) by 2 microsatellites (TP 43, TP 32). For a more detailed analysis of the differences obtained in this study, we plan to use the fluorescently (6 -FAM) marked primers, for sequencing and genotyping of the amplification products...|$|R

The characterisation and differentiation of Fasciola populations is crucial to control the disease, given the different transmission, epidemiology and pathology characteristics of the two species. Lineal biometric features of adult liver flukes infecting livestock have been studied to characterise and discriminate fasciolids from Bangladesh. An accurate analysis was conducted to phenotypically discriminate between fasciolids from naturally infected bovines (cattle, buffaloes) throughout the country. Morphometric analyses were made with a computer image analysis system (CIAS) applied {{on the basis of}} standardised measurements and the logistic model of the body growth and development of fasciolids in the different host groups. Since it is the first ever comprehensive study of this kind undertaken in Bangladesh, the results are compared to pure fasciolid populations of F. hepatica from the European Mediterranean area and F. gigantica from Burkina Faso, geographical areas where both species do not co-exist. Principal component analysis showed that the biometric characteristics of fasciolids from Bangladesh are situated between F. hepatica and F. gigantica standard populations, indicating the presence of phenotypes of intermediate forms in Bangladesh. These results are analysed by considering the present emergence of animal fascioliasis, the local lymnaeid fauna, the impact of climate change, and the risk of human infection in the country...|$|R
40|$|Paragonimiasis is an {{important}} <b>food-borne</b> parasitic <b>zoonosis</b> caused by infection with lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Of the 7 members of the genus known in Thailand until recently, only P. heterotremus has been confirmed as causing human disease. An 8 th species, P. pseudoheterotremus, has recently been proposed from Thailand, and {{has been found in}} humans. Molecular data place this species as a sister species to P heterotremus, and it is likely that P pseudoheterotremus is not specifically distinct from P. heterotremus. In this study, we collected metacercariae of both nominal species (identification based on metacercarial morphology) from freshwater crabs from Phetchabun Province in northern Thailand, Saraburi Province in central Thailand, and Surat Thani Province in southern Thailand. In addition, we purchased freshwater crabs imported from Myanmar at Myawaddy Province, western Thailand, close to the Myanmar-Thailand border. The DNAs extracted from excysted metacercariae were FOR-amplified and sequenced for ITS 2 and cox 1 genes. The ITS 2 sequences were nearly identical among all samples (99 - 100 %). Phylogenies inferred from all available partial cox 1 sequences contained several clusters. Sequences from Indian P heterotremus formed a sister group to sequences from P pseudoheterotremus-type metacercariae. Sequences of P heterotremus from Thailand, Vietnam, and China formed a separate distinct clade. One metacercaria from Phitsanulok Province was distinct from all others. There is clearly considerable genetic variation in the P heterotremus complex in Thailand and the form referred to as P pseudoheterotremus is widely distributed in Thailand and the Thai-Myanmar border region...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatitis E is {{a classic}} {{water-borne}} disease in developing countries. In Germany, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are notifiable. The number of non–travel-associated infections has increased in recent years, but the route of transmission in most is unknown. Our objective was to determine risk factors for autochthonous HEV infections in Germany. Methods: Cases of HEV met clinical definitions and were confirmed by laboratory analysis (defined as detection of HEV by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or immunoglobulinMby serologic testing). PCR products from blood or stool samples were genotyped for phylogenetic analysis. A case-control study included case subjects with autochthonous HEV infection and matched control subjects who were randomly recruited from a population-based telephone list. Results: From May 2006 through August 2007, 76 of 96 persons for whom HEV infection had been reported to the routine surveillance system were interviewed. Sixty-six persons had disease that fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 45 (68 %) had autochthonous infection, and 21 (32 %) had travel-associated disease. Genotypes 3 or 4 were present in 15 of 15 persons with autochthonous infection, and genotype 1 was present in 8 of 9 persons with travel-associated infection. In conditional logistic regression involving 45 case subjects and 135 control subjects, consumption of offal (41 % vs. 19 %; odds ratio [OR], 2. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 6. 2) and wild-boar meat (20 % vs. 7 %; OR, 4. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 2 – 15. 9) were independently associated with autochthonous HEV infection. Conclusion: Hepatitis E is endemic in Germany and likely exists as a <b>food-borne</b> <b>zoonosis.</b> Implicated meat products should be investigated to provide recommendations for preventive measures...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on trichinellosis, a <b>food-borne</b> <b>zoonosis</b> caused by a nematode of the genus Trichinella, in Thailand. The main objectives were to characterise human trichinellosis, determine its endemic foci and characterise factors influencing infection in humans and in the pig, which is an important domestic animal reservoir host of Trichinella. The investigations comprised (i) a retrospective review to characterise human trichinellosis in Thailand, (ii) a survey to characterise factors influencing trichinellosis in pigs and (iii) quantitative and qualitative studies to characterise the factors influencing trichinellosis in humans. An analysis of Thai national trichinellosis surveillance data between 1981 and 2008 highlighted the five northernmost provinces in the Northern Region as particularly affected with trichinellosis. The incidence of human trichinellosis in Thailand decreased significantly during this period. Until recently, trichinellosis was found to cluster significantly in these provinces. Domestic pigs and wild boar {{appeared to be the}} major sources of infection. Field studies focused on populations in Nan Province in the Northern Region, where specific foci of human trichinellosis have been observed. A survey of pig production in both lowland and highland areas in five districts of Nan Province found small-scale pig production to be predominant. Production and management practices differed significantly between lowland and highland areas. In the highland areas, pig production was mainly for the owners’ own use. The holdings were poorly managed compared with those in lowland areas. A survey of trichinellosis seroprevalence in these five districts showed the disease to be associated with scavenging pigs (OR = 2. 96, p = 0. 02) and older pigs (OR = 1. 02, p = 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Fasciola hepatica, a {{trematode}} parasite (liver fluke), infects a {{wide range}} of host species causing fasciolosis. The disease is prevalent world-wide and causes considerable economic losses to the livestock industry. Fasciolosis is regarded as an emerging <b>food-borne</b> <b>zoonosis.</b> To promote awareness among farmers and to implement strategies to control the infection, this study examined the prevalence, spatial distribution and risk factors for F. hepatica infection in Danish cattle herds. Methods: A retrospective population based study was performed using meat inspection data of approximately 1. 5 million cattle slaughtered in the period 2011 to 2013. Annual cumulative prevalence of recorded liver fluke findings was calculated for each year. Global and local spatial cluster analysis was used to identify and map spatial patterns of F. hepatica positive and negative herds to explore environmental indicators of infection. Herd level, trade and environmental risk factors were evaluated for association with infection using logistic regression. Herd infection status as predicted from the final risk factor model was compared with the observed status using heat maps to assess how well the model fitted the observed spatial pattern. Results: During the investigated period (2011 – 2013), an increase in annual herd prevalence was noted (2011 – 25. 6 %; 2012 – 28. 4 %; 2013 – 29. 3 %). The spatial analysis suggested significant clustering of positive and negative herds. Presence of streams, wetlands and pastures on farms showed a significant association with the presence of infection in cattle herds. Buying animals from positive herds was a risk factor on conventional farms. Additionally, risk of being infected with F. hepatica was higher in non-dairy herds of medium size (= 30 and < 100) when compared to dairy and large (= 100) cattle herds. The observed spatial pattern could be reproduced by predictions of the risk factor model. Conclusions: This study showed an increase in annual herd level prevalence (2011 to 2013) indicating that an increasing proportion of herds are infected with F. hepatica infection every year in Denmark. Fasciolosis was found to be associated with both herd and environmental factors where the infection was influenced by local factors that clustered geographically...|$|E

The rSeCP had the CP enzymatic activity and SeCP seems to be important for the survival of plerocercoids in host. The rSeCP is a potential diagnostic antigen for sparganosis...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative {{agent of}} {{hepatitis}} E, {{and is an}} unenveloped pos 1 tive sense single-stranded RNA wus. Swine HEV strains are genetically closely related to human strains from the same area, suggesting the occurrence of zoonotic transmission. Recently, human cases of hepatitiS E {{have been linked to}} the consumption of raw or undercooked meat or organs from deer, wild boars or p 1 gs. The disease is now considered an emerging <b>food-borne</b> transmitted <b>zoonosis.</b> During 2006, a pilot investigation was performed to determine the prevalence of HEV in pig farms located in Northern Italy., 274 faecal samples were collected from healthy fattening animals (3 - 4 and 8 - 9 months of age) and from healthy breeding animals (gilts and sows) from 6 different farms, and analyzed using a Nested-RT-PCR target 1 ng the open reading frame 2 (ORF 2) region. Stool samples were suspended in water, and viral RNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit. Extracted viral RNA was subjected to RT-PCR amplification using degenerate primers conA 1 -conS 1 for the first amplification, and degenerate primers conA 2 -conS 2 for the nested PCR, yielding a final fragment of 145 bp. HEV RNA was detected in sixty-nine of the 274 (25. 2 %) examined samples. None of the six farms resulted negative and the prevalence within the farms ranged between 2 % and 60. 5 % For the characterization of the strains, randomly selected positive samples were subjected to nucleotide sequencing, and aligned with those present in the NCBI Data Bank Sequence analysis showed that all stra 1 ns were Swine Hepatitis E belonging to Genotype 3. These preliminary results confirm that swine HEV is widespread in Italian swine farms...|$|R
