5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> children, four <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> teenagers, and five <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> adults.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> 1984 to 103 <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E

50|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{experienced}} on the Rhine-Main S-Bahn is frequent unpunctuality, {{one reason for}} which is the shortage of capacity in the Citytunnel. Capacity of the tunnel was increased from 22 trains per <b>hour</b> (<b>in</b> each direction) to 24 trains per <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> 2010 by optimising the Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung signalling system, rather than upgrading the system to the more modern Linienzugbeeinflussung (LZB) system, as used on the Munich S-Bahn to achieve a throughput of 30 trains per <b>hour</b> <b>in</b> each direction in the Munich core city tunnel.|$|R
