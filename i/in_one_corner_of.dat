5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the room.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E

Graves are also placed along the exterior wall before the entrance, with inscriptions in Armenian. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the courtyard, there is a raised area with a memorial to the 1915 Armenian Genocide in Turkey. Across the courtyard and facing the cathedral, there is a building housing a library and museum. Outside of this building are several carved stones showing scenes from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|While {{this took}} place, in April the new Chief of Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet, {{appointed}} {{a committee of}} senior officers headed by Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois to approve a design. In July it rejected the circular layout proposed for the new base and put forth a plan that placed all buildings <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the property. Just prior to acceptance of the property, Lahm sharply criticized the revision to Fechet and a reconsideration, also on August 16, 1928, approved the original circular design. Clark was then detailed for special duty in Washington D.C. as Lahm's liaison with the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, which would build the base.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, little changed {{politically}} in Russia {{during this}} period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its tercentenary, but the crowds that flocked {{to see the}} processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend. In 1914, Russia was forced {{to go to war}} {{as a result of the}} Triple Entente Alliance. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.|$|E

500|$|The castle was {{positioned}} <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the town, following a similar town plan {{to that in}} the town of Conwy, although in Beaumaris no town walls were constructed at first, despite some foundations being laid. Work began in the summer of 1295, overseen by Master James of St George. James had been appointed the [...] "master of the king's works in Wales", reflecting the responsibility he had in their construction and design. From 1295 onwards, Beaumaris became his primary responsibility and more frequently he was given the title [...] "magister operacionum de Bello Marisco". The work was recorded in considerable detail on the pipe rolls, the continuous records of medieval royal expenditure, and, as a result, the early stages of construction at Beaumaris are relatively well understood for the period.|$|E

500|$|On April 20, 2010, Gaga {{performed}} the song at the MAC AIDS Fund Pan-Asia Viva Glam launch in Tokyo where {{she wore a}} doily lace dress. She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, she sat at her piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in talcum powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames pouring out of the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher from ABC News called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio. In May 2011, Gaga {{performed the}} song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.|$|E
