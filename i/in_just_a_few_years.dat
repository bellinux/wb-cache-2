25|$|The foul strike {{rule was}} a major rule change that, <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> sent {{baseball}} from a high-scoring game to a game where scoring any runs was a struggle. Prior to this rule, foul balls did not count as strikes. Thus, a batter could foul off a countless number of pitches with no strikes counted against him—except for bunt attempts. This gave the batter an enormous advantage. In 1901, the National League adopted the foul strike rule, and the American League followed suit in 1903.|$|E

Base schools usually have an even higher turnover rate, reaching 100% turnover {{in as little as}} 2 years. Due to revocation of base privileges upon reaching the age of 18 (or 23 if one attends college), access to bases to reminisce or reconnect with one's places of growing up can also be difficult.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments would already be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff {{to have to learn}} several new systems, one after the other, <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E
25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods– highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair— for raising {{the value of the}} pound sterling on the bourse of Antwerp which proved so successful that <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, 90 {{percent of the}} urban {{population}} of the United States had electric power, in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies {{did not feel that}} extending power to rural areas (rural electrification) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.|$|E

25|$|O'Brien's {{performance}} at the World Cup {{attracted the attention of}} Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and he secured a contract with the club for 2011. John Bracewell, Gloucestershire's coach, viewed O'Brien as primarily a one-day player and believed his style of batting was best suited to situations where the team needed to increase their run-rate. He made his debut for Gloucestershire on 15May, scoring three runs from four balls in a CB40 match against Glamorgan. In June he scored his first century in twenty20 cricket, beating his previous highest score of 39. His innings of 119runs against Middlesex came from 52deliveries and helped lift Gloucestershire to the highest total in the history of domestic T20 cricket. O'Brien shared an opening stand of 192 with Hamish Marshall, who also scored a century, and the pair set a record partnership for any wicket in the format.(But this record was broken <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years)</b> When O'Brien was finally dismissed, he received a standing ovation.Both Kevin O'Brien and Hamish Marshall became the first pair of batsmen to score centuries in a single T20.|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 1907, Sir George Gibb, {{managing}} director of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), appointed Stanley as its general manager. The UERL was the holding company of four underground railways in central London. Three of these (the District Railway, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway) were already in operation and the fourth (the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway) was about to open. The UERL had been established by American financier Charles Yerkes and much of the finance and equipment had been brought from the United States, so Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> had put the company in a precarious monetary position and income was not sufficient to pay the interest on its loans. [...] Stanley's responsibility was to restore its finances.|$|E

500|$|A very {{significant}} change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s, with the so-called du-reformen, [...] "the you-reform". Previously, {{the proper way to}} address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of herr ("Mr" [...] or [...] "Sir"), fru ("Mrs" [...] or [...] "Ma'am") or fröken ("Miss") was considered the only acceptable mode of initiating conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ni (the standard second person plural pronoun), analogous to the French Vous. (Cf. T-V distinction.) Ni (plural second person pronoun) wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of du (singular second person pronoun) used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these previously significant distinctions of class became less important, and du became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decrees, but rather a sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> from the late 1960s to early 1970s. The use of ni as a polite form of address is occasionally encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among younger speakers.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Xiangyang (...) {{was a key}} {{battle between}} the invading Mongols of the Yuan dynasty and Southern Song forces from AD 1267 to 1273. After the battle, the victorious Yuan forces pushed farther into the Song heartland. Previously for 30 years, the Song dynasty managed to handle several major offensives by the Mongol Empire. The {{strategic}} significance of Xiangyang came {{from the fact that}} it was in a position dominating the Han river.

After the Battle of Xiangyang, the Song dynasty could not enjoy the protection of natural barriers any more and so it collapsed <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> with the final battle being the relatively short naval Battle of Yamen in 1279.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dimensions}} and key {{system of the}} modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely {{the work of the}} great flautist, composer, acoustician, and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. It was immediately popular, and spread worldwide <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost exactly as he designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large straight tube bore, [...] "parabolic" [...] tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the [...] "crutch" [...] for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G key over an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys.|$|E

2500|$|Gibraltar {{has always}} had to import almost {{everything}} it consumes; this was no different in the late 19th century when Gibraltar was a British garrison with few civilians. Bartolo {{was able to take}} advantage of this fact by supplying the local population with all and sundry - [...] "from safety matches to flour, from buckets of lard to spaghetti". By the turn of the 19th century, the business was the top provisions merchant in Gibraltar. Soon Bartolo expanded into the Spanish and Moroccan markets and before long became rather wealthy. He soon realised that the future of his business lay in coffee which over a few years became an increasingly profitable part of the business, perhaps from his dealing with Spain. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> coffee had generally become big business in Gibraltar which was probably partly down to the profitable smuggling trade which had become part of daily life on the Rock. Coffee, as well as tobacco, were the two main exports historically smuggled across the land border from Gibraltar into Spain. In 1906 Bartolo purchased a merchant house designed by renown Italian architect, Giovanni Maria Boschetti, on the corner of Irish Town and Tuckey's Lane.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{the markets}} crashed, the boom ended, and many left San Francisco. South of Market, where many dot-com {{companies}} were located, had been bustling and crowded with few vacancies, but by 2002 was a virtual wasteland of empty offices and for-rent signs. Much {{of the boom}} was blamed for the city's [...] "fastest shrinking population", reducing the city's population by 30,000 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> While the bust has helped put an ease on the city's apartment rents, the city remains expensive. By 2003, the city's economy had recovered from the dot-com crash thanks to a resurgent international tourist industry and the Web 2.0 boom that saw the creation of many new internet and software start-up companies in the city, attracting white-collar workers, recent University graduates, and [...] young adults {{from all over the}} world. Residential demand as well as rents rose again, and as a result city officials relaxed building height restrictions and zoning codes to construct residential condominiums in SOMA such as One Rincon Hill, 300 Spear Street, and Millennium Tower, although the late 2000s recession has indefinitely halted many construction projects such as Rincon Hill. Part of this development is the reconstruction of the Transbay Terminal Replacement Project.|$|E
