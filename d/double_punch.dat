40|$|AbstractMeasurement of tensile {{strength}} of soil by direct methods {{can be challenging}} due to difficulties in sample preparation and in fixing the specimen while applying uniaxial tension forces. However the {{tensile strength}} of soil samples can be measured by indirect tests, such as the Brazilian and <b>double</b> <b>punch</b> tests, assuming that tensile stress is distributed uniformly on the failure plane. In this study, the tensile strength of statically-compacted sand bentonite and cement-enhanced sand bentonite mixtures is measured in varying curing time periods using the “double punch” test. The compressive strengths of samples are also measured using the unconfined compression test, and the correlation between tensile and compressive strength is discussed in relation to curing time. A simple method is also applied to determine the undrained cohesion and internal friction angle of samples through the Mohr-Coulomb circle method, using the <b>double</b> <b>punch</b> tensile strength and unconfined compressive strength. The results show that cohesion increases in both sand bentonite and sand bentonite-cement samples along with curing time...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of tests {{currently}} used for the characterization of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) only allow a unidirectional characterization (without considering {{the orientation of the}} fibres in the matrix). However, from a design-oriented perspective, the anisotropy due to the dispersion and orientation of fibres has {{to be taken into account}} when characterizing the mechanical behaviour of the material. In this paper, an alternative to the conventional tests applied for the characterization of FRC is proposed. The multidirectional <b>double</b> <b>punch</b> test (MDPT) consists of a <b>double</b> <b>punch</b> test applied to a cubic specimen. Due to the specimen shape in a single procedure an estimation of the fibre orientation efficiency can be obtained, establishing a link between the mechanical properties of FRC with the fibre orientation. Thereby, this paper represents a meaningful contribution to provide a step towards the development of a rational and design-oriented constitutive model for real-scale structures.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>punch</b> test {{is used to}} {{indirectly}} {{assess the}} tensile strength of plain concrete, ft. For this normalized test, the tensile strength is obtained {{as a function of}} the failure load, P, which is expressed as f_t = F(P). Different authors have proposed different expressions for the relation F(·), yielding scattered values of f_t. None of these alternatives is universally recognized as being more suitable than the others. In fact, these expressions are mainly based on elastic models considering the maximum tensile stress under the load P and ft is obtained as an output of the linear model. A numerical simulation allows using models in which f_t is an input of the material model and the corresponding failure load P is obtained associated with each value of f_t. In the present work, <b>double</b> <b>punch</b> test is simulated numerically considering two alternatives for modeling plain concrete accounting for damage and cracking: (a) the nonlocal Mazars damage model and (b) an heuristic crack model including joint elements in an a priori defined crack pattern.

40|$|Traditionally, {{flexural}} {{testing is}} used to characterize the strength and post–peak behavior of fiber–reinforced concretes (FRC). Nevertheless, these tests results exhibit a high dispersion, and therefore invalidate their use as tests for the systematic control of FRCs in works.

With the aim to solve these problems, an indirect tensile test based on <b>double</b> <b>punching</b> test set up, called the Barcelona test, has been proposed to control tensile behavior of FRC.
