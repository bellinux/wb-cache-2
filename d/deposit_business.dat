50|$|The biggest change, however, {{took place}} behind the scenes. Instead of {{focusing}} {{on the needs of}} the utilities (which had by this time already adopted the Giro) and the personal banking market, National Giro would aim to capture the cash <b>deposit</b> <b>business</b> then dominated by the commercial clearing banks. The Post Office itself was a major customer of the commercial banks. It had a constant need for cash in order for it to pay out social security payments (welfare payments and pensions). Bank notes and coin had to be obtained from the banks which charged a fee for this service. The banks were also charging the depositors of these notes and coin, all of which needed to be counted before being passed on to the Post Office (which itself then had extra costs in counting the money provided by the banks. The new system was brilliantly simple. Large depositors of cash (supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations etc.) would be encouraged through pricing to pay their cash into the Post Office. Post Offices are more convenient and open longer hours so there was a natural case for choosing the Post Office. What's more, the depositor would count the money once and seal it discrete envelopes of say, units of £100, £500 or £1000. The Post Office would take the money on trust, but commit to counting it not on receipt, but within a fixed period, of say 5 days. Thus within the Post Office, money could be handled very easily and its source was clearly marked. The money would be counted {{at the time it was}} needed (i.e. when the envelope needed to be opened). Discrepancies were reported to the Giro, so that any attempt at systematic fraud could be easily identified. And the Giro could charge both the depositor for the deposit and the Post Office as an internal charge for the provision of the cash. As these charges were lower than those being charged by the commercial banks, everybody was happy. The Post Office internal handling of cash also became much simplified by the handling of fixed value envelopes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an integrated}} model of pricing and dividend policies in open credit cooperatives (those that {{do business with}} members and non-members on a non-discriminatory basis). We show that both the distribution of member preferences {{and the amount of}} non-member business the cooperative does influence its optimal pricing and dividend policies. For a fixed distribution of member preferences, the larger the fraction of business done by members, the smaller the optimal dividend and the larger the optimal pricing subsidy (hence, increasing demand). On the other hand, for a fixed fraction of member business, the greater the skewness of member preferences toward loan (<b>deposit)</b> <b>business</b> with the credit cooperative, the larger the optimal dividend and the higher (lower) the optimal loan (deposit) interest rate. Aggregate empirical evidence from the German cooperative banking sector supports a version of the latter prediction, namely, that in an increasingly depositor-dominated open credit cooperative, average deposit rates tend to fall as dividend payouts rise.

40|$|Today in the United States, {{virtually}} every commercial bank makes safe deposit services {{available for a}} small fee, either through a department of the bank or through a subsidiary or affiliated safe deposit company. Never before has the demand for safe deposit services been so great. More than ever before, Americans are turning to safe deposit companies and bank safe deposit vaults for the storage of their assets. This increased demand has caused increased concern among legislators and bankers about whether to regulate further the day-to-day affairs of the safe <b>deposit</b> <b>business.</b> Increased use of safe deposit vaults and boxes will predictably lead to more litigation concerning the rights and responsibilities of banks and their customers. It is therefore important to examine {{the legal status of}} the relationship of the bank to its safe deposit customer.

40|$|Universal banking {{means that}} banks are {{permitted}} to offer all of the various kinds of financial services. This includes classical banking activities like the credit and <b>deposit</b> <b>business,</b> as well as investment services, placement and brokerage of securities, and even insurance activities, trading in real estate and others. German universal banks also hold stock in nonfinancial firms and offer to vote their clients' shares in other firms. This paper deals with universal banks and {{their role in the}} investment business, more specifically, their links with investment companies and their various roles as shareholders and providers of financial services to such companies. Banks and investment companies have, as financial intermediaries, one trait in common: they both transform capital of investors (depositors and shareholders of investment funds, respectively) into funds (loans and equity or debt securities, respectively) that are channeled to other firms. So why should a regulation forbid to combine these transformation tasks in one institution or group, and why should the law not allow banks to establish investment companies and provide all kinds of financial services to them in addition to their banking services? German banking and investment company law have answered these questions in the affirmative. This paper argues that the existing regulation is not a sound and recommendable one. The paper is organized as follows: Sections II - V identify four areas where the combination of banking and investment might either harm the shareholders of the investment funds and/or negatively affect other constituencies such as the shareholders of the banking institution. These sections will at the same time explore whether there are institutional or regulatory provisions in place or market forces at work that adequately protect investors and the other constituencies in question. Concluding remarks follow (VI.) ...|$|E
