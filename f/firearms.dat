5|$|<b>Firearms</b> {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and <b>firearms</b> spread elsewhere very quickly.

The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got <b>firearms</b> no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans.

5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested in massive transfer of now legal <b>firearms</b> into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal <b>firearms</b> entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 <b>firearms</b> legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned <b>firearms,</b> i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned <b>firearms</b> illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their <b>firearms.</b> The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal <b>firearms</b> and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 Background: Sentinel events {{preceding}} <b>firearm</b> perpetration events {{could be}} potential points of intervention to prevent injury and death related to <b>firearm</b> in King County. Objective: To compare risks of <b>firearm</b> perpetration among perpetrators of violent crime, and compare risk of fatal shootings among <b>firearm</b> perpetrators of violent crime. Study Design: Case-control study. Setting and Subjects: Study {{was conducted in}} 7 police jurisdiction encompassing 95 % of all <b>firearm</b> violent crime cases from 2006 – 2016 within King County, Washington. Cases were individuals who perpetrated with a <b>firearm,</b> and control were individuals who perpetrated without a <b>firearm.</b> Additionally, fatal shootings were defined <b>firearm</b> crimes where the victims deceased, and nonfatal shootings were <b>firearm</b> crimes where victims did not decease. Result: There were 208 <b>firearm</b> perpetrators and 738 non-firearm perpetrators identified for the study, with 55 fatal shootings and 153 nonfatal shootings. Between <b>firearm</b> perpetrators and non-firearm perpetrators, significant risk factors include juvenile criminal history, adult criminal history, history of <b>firearm</b> injury, education, and number of co-offenders. Between fatal and nonfatal shootings, fatal shooting is associated with type of <b>firearm,</b> history of criminal conviction, drug and alcohol intoxication, and previous exposure to <b>firearm</b> injury. Conclusion: Previous criminal history is {{associated with an increased}} risk for <b>firearm</b> perpetration and fatal shootings. Further research should be conducted on interventions and prevention strategies in the criminal justice system, law enforcement agencies, public health institutions, and hospital settings...|$|R

During 2006 – 2007, a total of 25, 423 <b>firearm</b> homicides and 34, 235 <b>firearm</b> suicides occurred among U. S. residents (1). These national totals include 4, 166 <b>firearm</b> homicides and 1, 446 <b>firearm</b> suicides among youths aged 10 – 19 years; the rate of <b>firearm</b> homicides among youths slightly exceeded the rate among persons of all ages.

5|$|Generally, <b>firearms</b> {{possession}} {{is not a}} politicized {{issue that}} would be debated during Czech elections.

5|$|Given that <b>firearms</b> {{possession}} {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal <b>firearms</b> following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal <b>firearms</b> ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed <b>firearms</b> licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for <b>firearms</b> licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{an effort}} to reduce <b>firearm</b> {{mortality}} rates in the USA, US states have enacted a range of <b>firearm</b> laws to either strengthen or deregulate the existing main federal gun control law, the Brady Law. We set out to determine the independent association of different <b>firearm</b> laws with overall <b>firearm</b> mortality, homicide <b>firearm</b> mortality, and suicide <b>firearm</b> mortality across all US states. We also projected the potential reduction of <b>firearm</b> mortality if the three most strongly associated <b>firearm</b> laws were enacted at the federal level. METHODS We constructed a cross-sectional, state-level dataset from Nov 1, 2014, to May 15, 2015, using counts of firearm-related deaths in each US state for the years 2008 - 10 (stratified by intent [homicide and suicide]) from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System, data about 25 <b>firearm</b> state laws implemented in 2009, and state-specific characteristics such as <b>firearm</b> ownership for 2013, <b>firearm</b> export rates, and non-firearm homicide rates for 2009, and unemployment rates for 2010. Our primary outcome measure was overall firearm-related mortality per 100   000 people in the USA in 2010.

5|$|On 15 March 1939, Germany {{invaded the}} {{remainder}} of Czechoslovakia. On the very first day, Chief Commander of German forces ordered surrender of all <b>firearms</b> present within the occupied territory. This pertained not only to civilian owned <b>firearms,</b> but also to those held by the police force. In August 1939, this order was replaced by Regulation of Reich Protector No. 20/39. The regulation again ordered surrender of all <b>firearms</b> and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all <b>firearms</b> that would be find within their property. Reich and Protectorate officials (including police) and SS Members were exempt from the gun ban. Licensed hunters could own up to 5 hunting guns and up to 50 pieces of ammunition. Long rimfire rifles, sport pistols up to 6 mm calibre, air rifles and museum guns were allowed, however {{they needed to be}} registered. Simple failure to surrender a firearm carried up to 5 years imprisonment, while hiding of cache of <b>firearms</b> carried death penalty. Offenders were tried in front of German courts.|$|E
