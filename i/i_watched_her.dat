25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} show's 2016 Christmas special, [...] "The Best of Tracey Ullman's Show", Ullman plays a {{workaholic}} Clare Balding. [...] "I like Clare. She was {{captain of the}} volleyball team at school. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> present the Olympics and she's incredible. She's really passionate when talking about horses, and she talks really fast... 'Beautiful filly, beautiful filly...' She never stops, you never feel uncomfortable with her, {{she knows how to}} talk to everybody. And I got this feeling that she was like, 'Oh, don't worry, I'll work the Christmas holidays, I can do that show, I'll work Boxing Day as well, nothing like the holidays.' She never stops." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> {{closely as}} <b>I</b> spoke, and {{was pleased to}} note respect {{suddenly}} dawn in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|A moment <b>I</b> stood <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> as she cantered {{away in the}} sunshine; then {{stepping}} to the litter, I vaulted in.|$|R
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> out of sight, {{and went}} on to {{interview}} Mr. Leigh.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{until the}} distant haze enveloped {{her and she}} had disappeared. I was alone.|$|E
5000|$|Bloggers {{began to}} provide nearly-instant {{commentary}} on televised events, creating a secondary {{meaning of the}} word [...] "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and editorialize speeches and events shown on television. (For example, [...] "I am blogging Rice's testimony" [...] means [...] "I am posting my reactions to Condoleezza Rice's testimony into my blog as <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as [...] "liveblogging." ...|$|R
6000|$|These words (<b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> {{white face}} as she spoke) gave me a slight shudder. She {{remained}} demure, almost prim. And I remarked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's no {{press in}} the room, and never was,' said I, {{resuming}} my seat, and looping up the curtain that <b>I</b> might <b>watch</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> for {{a little}} while until one of the poachers ran up with a stick.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not look}} back. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her,</b> till the sunlight, {{streaming}} in my eyes, raised a golden mist between us.|$|E
60|$|She flitted to my colour {{prints and}} my little case of books. Then {{she went to the}} pianola. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> intently.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was purely}} nervous, purely nervous. <b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> closely. With a heart in that {{condition}} and her digestion wrecked--yes, wrecked--anything might happen." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> stood <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> litter till it {{vanished}} {{in the evening}} haze. Then I turned to go to find myself {{face to face with}} Huaracha.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} up to my room," [...] she said, [...] "and as I passed the landing window which looks into the {{courtyard}} I saw you talking to your wife. I--I am afraid that <b>I</b> <b>watched.</b> <b>I</b> saw <b>her</b> leave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> well as I {{pronounced}} {{that name}} but I saw nothing wonderful. Why should I indeed--was not Jeffrey Aspern {{the property of}} the human race? ...|$|E
60|$|Dazed, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{open the}} bedroom doors, motion to Lindy to pass through, {{and then she}} had closed them again and I was alone in the darkened parlor.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> longer, and {{he stole}} [...] Her lily tincts and rose; All her young sprightliness of soul Next fell beneath his cold control, [...] And {{disappeared}} like those.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>I</b> not <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{these many}} years, Macumazahn? Shall <b>I</b> cease to <b>watch</b> because a {{wandering}} white man comes to steal her? Why were you kissing {{her in the}} garden, Macumazahn? How dare you kiss her who is a star?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yet I've {{forgotten}} in playing this game, Things I {{have known that}} shall have no name; Forgetting the place from which <b>I</b> came <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> ward away the flame, Yet warm herself at the fire--then blame Me that I flicker in the basket; Me that I glow not with content To have my substance so subtly spent; Me that I interrupt her game. I ought to be proud that she should ask it Of me to be her fire-opal--.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not comely, at least, {{to confess}} their love to men. But {{she has never}} done that, Amyas; not even by a look or a tone of voice, though <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> for months." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{face and}} soothed {{her to go}} on, I saw that Mr. Bucket {{received}} this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{damned if}} I go again!" [...] said Jack. [...] "She {{was in the}} second time, I know. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> into the house. Confound the stuck-up pair of them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Voraciously <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{smooth face}} as she untied the thread. [...] "A little ivory box!" [...] she exclaimed, pushing back the lid, [...] "and a Buddhist temple, how very pretty. Thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} {{much more than}} what I put in the message," [...] said the man. [...] "I saw the {{houseboat}} out yonder and headed in that direction. <b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> when a fog came up and hid her from view." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had not <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{sunlight}} blithe As o'er {{their shells}} it dances-- I've seen those winkles almost writhe Beneath her beaming glances.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have seen}} her in gowns the brightest, [...] Of azure, green, and red, And in the simplest, whitest, [...] Muslined from heel to head; <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> walking, riding, [...] Shade-flecked by a leafy tree, Or in fixed thought abiding [...] By the foam-fingered sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> face {{carefully}} as I spoke, and I thought that I detected a very faint flush mounting her cheek. Seeing an opening and an advantage, I sought {{to follow it}} up.|$|E
60|$|On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with {{gathering}} wild strawberries in Hay Lane {{half the}} day, {{had gone to}} bed with the sun. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> all {{the evening}} and the queer feeling in me somewhere grew worse and worse. I couldn't eat anything. Sidney took Mrs. Rennie in; they sat {{opposite}} to me and talked all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{saw the two}} {{coming up}} the path, and wanted to learn if she were not one of them. Can I help disliking her if I think of the past? Can <b>I</b> help <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> {{remember}} my boy? Can I help ill-wishing her if I well-wish him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She {{is a fine}} ship, sir, and no mistake. Tom and <b>I</b> were <b>watching</b> <b>her</b> lying out in the harbour yesterday, {{and were}} saying that, though {{we have always been}} {{accustomed}} to frigates, we should not mind shipping in her if we found out something about the captain.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, you oughtn't to {{have allowed}} {{yourself}} to do so. Well, there I agree with you.
