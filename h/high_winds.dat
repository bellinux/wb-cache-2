50|$|In <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> areas, such {{as where}} a cyclone or {{hurricane}} may make landfall, the main engineering consideration {{is to hold}} the roof down during severe storms. Every component of the roof, as of course {{the rest of the}} structure, has to withstand the uplift forces of <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speeds. This is accomplished by using metal ties fastened to each rafter or truss. This is not normally a problem in areas not prone to <b>high</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|R

5|$|Initial {{news reports}} stated that Kirogi {{produced}} deadly flooding in the Philippines; however, {{the storm was}} {{too far from the}} country to have any impacts. In Japan, Kirogi produced torrential rainfall and <b>high</b> <b>winds,</b> killing five people and leaving 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD) in damages.

40|$|Wind {{related damage}} is {{increasing}} in Malaysia. The {{information related to}} wind characteristics is very important. <b>High</b> <b>wind</b> speed area will result higher rate of damage. In this study, the wind speed identities are finding out by using Geographical Information System (GIS) application and the locations are located. Mean wind speed from weather station are been use. Spatial analyses are conducted to Peninsular Malaysia. From the analysis it shows that wind related disasters are tendency to follow any <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> speed. Therefore it can conclude that the <b>higher</b> <b>wind</b> speed will cause <b>high</b> rate of <b>wind</b> damage...|$|R

30|$|In general, the {{electricity}} price {{is expected to}} be lower during <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> periods, so that <b>higher</b> <b>wind</b> power can shift the supply curve to the right area in Fig.  9. However, the impact of wind power depends on the load level. If there is plenty of wind power during the peak power demand, wind power may significantly reduce the power price (from Price A to Price B). However if a <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> production happens during a low power demand period, where the most power is produced by base load plants, the impact of wind power on {{the electricity}} price would be low.|$|R

5|$|Gloria's <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> downed {{numerous}} trees across New England, causing minor {{to moderate}} damage. In the region, Connecticut received {{the worst of}} the hurricane, where tree and structural damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. New Hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding. In Maine, damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> across New England resulted in significant power outages, leaving 250,000 in Maine. In all, seven deaths occurred in New England, many of which occurred from falling tree limbs.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E

5|$|In Kyushu, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529ha (55,670acres) and accounting for ¥64billion ($530million USD) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya {{was killed when}} the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. <b>High</b> <b>winds</b> and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars, killing one person in Ōshima. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. On nearby Shikoku island, <b>high</b> <b>winds</b> and rains caused ¥4.7billion ($35.7million USD) in damage in Tokushima, mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses. A record storm surge, in conjunction with <b>high</b> <b>winds,</b> damaged a school in Sakaide, {{as well as a}} floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture.

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> events in the deep, narrow Owens Valley {{in the lee of}} the Sierra Nevada in California, are studied using climate data form surface and upper-air observations. Four possible mechanisms are considered including downward momentum transfer, forced channeling, pressure-driven channeling, and frontal passage. The <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> events with winds blowing up-valley from south to north are primarily caused by forced channeling of strong synoptic winds ahead of a deep trough off the coast of California. The <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> events with northerly along-valley winds are associated with cold frontal passages, with post-frontal cold air under-running and displacing warmer air in the valley...|$|R
