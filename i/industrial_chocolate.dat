50|$|In 1868 Hugo Hoffmann {{opened a}} company to produce sweets. The {{location}} of this shop was in Mohrenstraße 10 in Berlin. The <b>industrial</b> <b>chocolate</b> production took place on Mehringdamm No. 57 (then Belle-Alliance-Str. 81) since 1881, extended by Mehringdamm No. 55 in 1903 (then Belle-Alliance-Str. 82) and Mehringdamm No. 53 in 1906 (then Belle-Alliance-Str. 83). In 1913 the factory {{moved into a new}} building on Teilestraße 13-15 in Tempelhof, now part of Berlin.|$|E
40|$|A DSC {{method for}} {{isothermal}} crystallization of cocoa butter is described. The crystallization curves may be linearized {{according to the}} empirical Avrami equation. From the resulting Avrami plots the rate constant of crystallization may be calculated. This method gives valuable results about the specific crystallization tendency of cocca butters of different origins and about temperature influence on crystallization times. The method seems to be useful for quality control of cocoa butters and for process control during the tempering step of the <b>industrial</b> <b>chocolate</b> production...|$|E
50|$|Aalst Chocolate is a {{manufacturer}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>chocolates</b> and compounds, gourmet chocolates and related products. It was established in 2003 in Singapore, by Richard Lee and Connie Kwan, who are currently Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer respectively. They are the first chocolate factory to be fully owned and managed by Singaporeans.|$|R
5000|$|Frey {{was founded}} in 1887 by the {{brothers}} Robert (31 December 1861 [...] - [...] 3 March 1940) and Max Frey (9 March 1863 [...] - [...] 17 December 1933). Both had already gained experience with the manufacture of chocolate before establishing the family business. After his training as a commercial employee with the company S.A. de la Fabrique des Chocolats Amédée Kohler et fils in Paris, Robert dealt with machines for the manufacture of chocolate in the engineering works Riccard & Greiss. Max completed his commercial apprenticeship with the company Cramer-Frey in Zurich, {{for which he was}} eventually also active in Brazil. On 17 December 1887, they founded the general partnership R. & M. Frey in Aarau.The development of the conche in 1879 advanced the <b>industrial</b> production of <b>chocolate</b> greatly. Robert was already familiar with this technique {{and he was able to}} integrate it in his company. Furthermore, from the very beginning production was carried out by electric machines.|$|R
40|$|This general talk {{is devoted}} to briefly {{introduce}} the main uses and applications of synchrotron radiation. An initial introduction will be dedicated to describe a synchrotron as a Large Facility devoted to produce photons {{that will be used}} to carry out excellent science. The five outstanding main characteristics of synchrotron radiation are: i) High brilliance and collimation ii) Wavelength tunability iii) Beamsize tunability iv) Defined polarization v) Time structure vi) (Partial) coherence These properties will be illustrated through selected examples ranging from biomedicine (f. i. determination of the crystal structure of macromolecules from tiny crystals or cryo- nano tomography of individual cells by soft X-ray transmission microscopy) to materials science (f. i. experiments of powder diffraction of materials under high pressure in diamond-anvil-cells), from cultural heritage (f. i. the study of degradation of pigments in paints by X-ray absorption spectroscopy) to cements (f. i. the hydration chemistry of eco-cements followed by in-situ powder diffraction), and from basic research on magnetic materials (f. i. ferromagnets where the magnetism of individual metal transition elements are selectively followed by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dicroism) to <b>industrial</b> applications on <b>chocolate</b> (f. i. small X-ray scattering as function of temperature of the polymorphs of cacao).

40|$|This article reviews cocoa and {{chocolate}} production, consumption and the <b>industrial</b> organization of <b>chocolate</b> making throughout history. Today, the cocoa {{and chocolate}} market exists out of different products for many different consumers. Most of these consumers {{can be found}} in the industrial countries of the world. However, the actual cocoa plant originated and became a monetary medium of exchange for trade as well as a fatty, dark concoction in South and Central America centuries ago under the Olmecs, Mayas and Aztecs (3000 BC- 1500 AC). After the Spanish discoveries of the New world, the cultivation of cocoa beans and the consumption and production of drinkable chocolate spread over the world during the Early Modern Times (1500 - 1800). In the age of Enlightenment (18 th century) this drink of the clergy and elite became rather unpopular. However, globalization and scientific discoveries from the 16 th through the 19 th century transformed the cocoa and chocolate industry and increased demand under the elite, inducing the growth of commercial factories. New scientific discoveries in the 19 th and 20 th centuries, which led to eatable chocolate, made chocolate also available for the common people. The 20 th century was characterized by a large increase in cocoa and chocolate production and consumption, and shifts in production regions and consumption patterns and preferences. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the rheology of chocolate in relation to its flow and mixing features in a real <b>industrial</b> environment. The <b>chocolate</b> manufacturing plant of Rowntree at York provided a base for this study. The project aims were: a) to measure the viscous and time dependent properties of chocolate. b) to explain the observed flow properties in relation to the constituents of chocolate. c) to determine the shear rate which, for a given recipe, yields a minimum stable viscosity (of particular commercial value). d) to assess the type of mixer able to provide this duty. The experimental work involved rheological studies with concentric cylinder and tubular viscometers, operated to measure viscosity as a function of shear rate and shearing time. The chocolate samples studied were taken from various points in the manufacture process at Rowntree, York. Model chocolate systems were made from cocoa liquor, and sugar with cocoa butter, which were studied to underpin the basic mechanisms of the flow properties of the total chocolate. Shear thinning in milk chocolate {{has been shown to be}} accounted for by surface coating and fat release from the cocoa cellular material. Analysis of the sugar and cocoa butter system gave large hysteresis loops which may be explained as due to agglomeration of the sugar particles. The level of hysteresis was found to be related to the polarity of the liquid phase, such that a more polar fluid results in less hysteresis. Laboratory experiments have revealed that the level of work input to give permanent viscosity reduction for milk chocolate is dependent on the measuring shear rate. The level of optimum shear input for the measuring range 10 to 130 sec 1 is 645 sec for 30 minutes. The apparent viscosity measured at lower shear rates requires much longer ([approx] 100 minutes).
