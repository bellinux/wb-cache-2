5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
