40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVDs), including atherosclerosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction, is a {{major cause}} of death worldwide. In aspects of cell therapy against CVD, it is generally accepted that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are potent neovascular modulators in <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues.</b> In response to ischemic injury signals, EPCs located in a bone marrow niche migrate to injury sites and form new vessels by secreting various vasculogenic factors including VEGF, SDF- 1, and FGF, as well as by directly differentiating into endothelial cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Macrophages, key {{regulators}} of healing/regeneration processes, strongly infiltrate <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues</b> {{from patients}} suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). However pro-inflammatory markers correlate with disease progression {{and risk of}} amputation, suggesting that modulating macrophage activation state might be beneficial. We previously reported that thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) is highly expressed in <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues</b> during CLI in humans. TSP- 1 is a matricellular protein that displays well-known angiostatic properties in cancer, and regulates inflammation in vivo and macrophages properties in vitro. We therefore sought to investigate its function in a mouse model of CLI. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a genetic model of tsp- 1 (-/-) mice subjected to femoral artery excision, we report that tsp- 1 (-/-) mice were clinically and histologically protected from necrosis compared to controls. Tissue protection was associated with increased postischemic angiogenesis and muscle regeneration. We next showed that macrophages present in <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues</b> exhibited distinct phenotypes in tsp- 1 (-/-) and wt mice. A strong reduction of necrotic myofibers phagocytosis was observed in tsp- 1 (-/-) mice. We next demonstrated that phagocytosis of muscle cell debris is a potent pro-inflammatory signal for macrophages in vitro. Consistently with these findings, macrophages that infiltrated <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues</b> exhibited a reduced postischemic pro-inflammatory activation state in tsp- 1 (-/-) mice, characterized by a reduced Ly- 6 C expression and a less pro-inflammatory cytokine expression profile. Finally, we showed that monocyte depletion reversed clinical and histological protection from necrosis observed in tsp- 1 (-/-) mice, thereby demonstrating that macrophages mediated tissue protection in these mice. CONCLUSION: This study defines targeting postischemic macrophage activation state as a new potential therapeutic approach to protect tissues from necrosis and promote tissue repair during CLI. Furthermore, our data suggest that phagocytosis {{plays a crucial role}} in promoting a deleterious intra-tissular pro-inflammatory macrophage activation state during critical injuries. Finally, our results describe TSP- 1 as a new relevant physiological target during critical leg ischemia...|$|R

The Wnt signaling system, comprising 19 lipophilic proteins, regulates vascular patterning in the developing embryo. However, the effects of Wnts on hEPCs and the adult vasculature remain unclear. We demonstrate here that Wnt 1 is expressed in a subset of endothelial cells lining the murine embryonic dorsal aorta and is reactivated in malignant angiosarcoma, suggesting a strong association of Wnt 1 with angiogenesis. We investigate the effects of Wnt 1 in enhancing hEPC function and blood flow to <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues</b> and show that Wnt 1 enhances the proliferative and angiogenic functions of hEPCs in a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) -dependent manner. Injection of Wnt 1 -expressing hEPCs increases blood flow and capillary density in murine ischemic hindlimbs. Furthermore, injection of Wnt 1 protein alone similarly increases blood flow and capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs, and this effect is associated with increased HGF expression in ischemic muscle.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCritical limb {{ischemia}} (CLI) is a {{major health}} problem with no adequate treatment. Since CLI is characterized by insufficient tissue vascularization, efforts {{have focused on the}} discovery of novel angiogenic factors. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is an immunophilin that has been shown to promote angiogenesis in vitro and to enhance bone marrow (BM) cell mobilization in vivo. However, its potential as an angiogenic factor in CLI is still unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether CyPA might induce neo-angiogenesis in <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues.</b> Methods and resultsWild-type C 57 Bl/ 6 j mice underwent acute hind-limb ischemia (HLI) and received a single intramuscular administration of recombinant CyPA or saline. Limb perfusion, capillary density and arteriole number in adductor muscles were significantly increased after CyPA treatment. Interestingly, BM-derived CD 117 + cell recruitment was significantly higher in <b>ischemic</b> adductor <b>tissue</b> of mice treated with CyPA versus saline. Therefore, the effect of CyPA on isolated BM-derived CD 117 + cells in vitro was evaluated. Low concentrations of CyPA stimulated CD 117 + cell proliferation while high concentrations promoted cell death. Moreover, CyPA enhanced CD 117 + cell adhesion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that CyPA up-regulated CXCR 4 in CD 117 + cells and in adductor muscles after ischemia. Additionally, SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis inhibition by the CXCR 4 antagonist AMD 3100 decreased CyPA-mediated CD 117 + cell recruitment in the ischemic limb.

50|$|Global brain {{ischemia}} {{occurs when}} {{blood flow to}} the brain is halted or drastically reduced. This is commonly caused by cardiac arrest.

50|$|Reperfusion of ischemic tissues {{is often}} {{associated}} with microvascular injury, particularly due to increased permeability of capillaries and arterioles that lead to an increase of diffusion and fluid filtration across the tissues. Activated endothelial cells produce more reactive oxygen species but less nitric oxide following reperfusion, and the imbalance results in a subsequent inflammatory response.The inflammatory response is partially responsible for the damage of reperfusion injury. White blood cells, carried to the area by the newly returning blood, release a host of inflammatory factors such as interleukins as well as free radicals in response to tissue damage. The restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within cells that damages cellular proteins, DNA, and the plasma membrane. Damage to the cell's membrane may in turn cause the release of more free radicals. Such reactive species may also act indirectly in redox signaling to turn on apoptosis. White blood cells may also bind to the endothelium of small capillaries, obstructing them and leading to more ischemia.Another hypothesis would be that normally, tissues contain free radical scavengers to avoid damage by oxidizing species normally contained in the blood. <b>Ischemic</b> <b>tissue</b> would have decreased function of these scavengers because of cell injury. Once blood flow is reestablished, oxygen species contained in the blood will damage the <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissue</b> because the function of the scavengers is decreased.|$|E
40|$|Ischemic {{and solid}} tumor tissues are less well perfused than normal tissue, leading to {{metabolic}} changes and chronic hypoxia, {{which in turn}} promotes angiogenesis. We identified human angiopoietin-like 4 (angptl 4) as a gene with hypoxia-induced expression in endothelial cells. We showed that the levels of both mRNA and protein for ANGPTL 4 increased in response to hypoxia. When tested in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, ANGPTL 4 induced a strong proangiogenic response, independently of vascular endothelial growth factor. In human pathology, ANGPTL 4 mRNA is produced in <b>ischemic</b> <b>tissues,</b> in conditions such as critical leg ischemia. In tumors, ANGPTL 4 is produced in the hypoxic areas surrounding necrotic regions. We observed particularly high levels of ANGPTL 4 mRNA in tumor cells of conventional renal cell carcinoma.
