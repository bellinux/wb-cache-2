Marines in a combat area may also wear <b>Flame</b> <b>resistant</b> organizational gear, or FROG uniforms. These combat uniforms are designed to reduce fire-related injuries, and look quite similar to the MCCUU. Other individual equipment may be worn as directed.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{versions}} of headlights and signal lights were fueled by acetylene or oil. Acetylene was preferred to oil, because its <b>flame</b> is <b>resistant</b> to both wind and rain. Acetylene headlights were popular until 1898, {{when the first}} electric headlights were introduced.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} headlamps were {{fueled by}} acetylene or oil, and {{were introduced in}} the late 1880s. Acetylene lamps were popular because the <b>flame</b> is <b>resistant</b> to wind and rain. The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric Car from the Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional. Two factors limited {{the widespread use of}} electric headlamps: the short life of filaments in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.|$|R

25|$|Traditional {{shoelaces}} {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like <b>flame</b> <b>resistant</b> nomex are applied in safety boots for firefighters.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy {{issued a}} new model {{coverall}} {{for use as a}} shipboard working uniform beginning in early 2014. The new <b>flame</b> <b>resistant</b> variant (FRV) coverall is used aboard all ships. It has largely replaced for shipboard use polyester cotton blend coveralls that provided inadequate fire protection and the NWU Type I for the same reason. The all cotton FRVs are dark blue in color compared to the older coveralls, which are lighter. They use rectangular velcro-backed nametags similar to those worn on flight crew suits, rather than the nametapes of the previous coverall.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Fleet Forces Command (FFC) {{continues}} a multi-phase {{wear test}} of improved <b>flame</b> <b>resistant</b> variant (IFRV) working uniform components for shipboard wear. FFC most recently conducted in-depth focus groups with fleet sailors aimed at refining {{the design of}} the IFRV coverall. The IFRV coverall was approved for issue on 17 January 2017. Additional feedback from the focus groups, subsequently validated by a senior level working group, resulted in the preliminary design of a more professional looking two-piece utility shipboard uniform that can be worn both at sea and operational support jobs ashore. Wear tests of the prototype two-piece variants are expected to occur in 2017.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flame</b> and {{temperature}} <b>resistant</b> polyimide foams are {{prepared by the}} reaction of an aromatic dianhydride, (pyromellitic dianhydride) with an aromatic polyisocyanate, (polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate), {{in the presence of}} an inorganic acid and furfuryl alcohol. Usable acids include dilute sulfuric acid, dilute nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, polyphosphoric acid, and phosphoric acid, with the latter being preferred. The dianhydride and the isocyanate in about equimolar proportions constitute about 50 % of the reaction mixture, the rest being made up with the acid and the alcohol in a ratio of about 1 : 10. An exothermic reaction between the acid and the alcohol provides the heat necessary for the other components to polymerize without recourse to external heat sources. The mixture can be sprayed on any surface to form polymeric foam in locations where the application of heat is not practical or possible, for instance, between walls or on mine tunnel surfaces...|$|R

50|$|Firepaste {{is a white}} paste that, when dry, is <b>flame</b> {{and heat}} <b>resistant.</b> It has a {{consistency}} and texture similar to clay when wet and dries into a gray ceramic material which resembles concrete. The impetus for firepaste came from a failed fire test with the Ursus Mark VII where the metal exoskeleton heated up, popped the air bags and left Hurtubise with numerous burns. Like Project Grizzly, Hurtubise has tested the material on himself. For a demonstration for the media and military in summer 2004, he made a thin mask of the material, put it over his face, and aimed a specialized blowtorch at thousands of degrees directly at the mask. The temperature was intentionally much hotter than the temperatures reached by the Space Shuttle on reentry. A thermometer located between his face and the mask measured no appreciable temperature change below the mask after nearly ten minutes, {{and the integrity of}} the material stood strong.|$|R
40|$|Polyacrylonitrile fiber {{encompasses}} {{a broad range}} of products based on acrylonitrile (AN) which is readily copolymerized {{with a wide range of}} ethylenic unsaturated monomers giving rise to polymers with different characteristics and applications. Such products can be designed for cost-effective, <b>flame</b> and heat <b>resistant</b> solutions for the textile industry, aircraft and automotive markets. In the present work acrylonitrile was copolymerized with vinylidene chloride (VDC) by conventional suspension polymerization process via redox system, with an initial content of 10 %/mass of the VDC monomer. The copolymer average molecular weight was obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and by intrinsic viscosity analysis. To control the polymerization process continuously, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the chloride content in the PAN AN/VDC copolymer structure was accomplished by using X-ray fluorescence and potentiometric titration techniques. A good correlation was found between these two techniques, leading to a straightforward verification of VDC in the polymer structure. The thermal behavior of PAN AN/VDC copolymer was performed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The results showed that VDC monomers exhibited a nearly stoichiometric reaction with acrylonitrile, copolymerizing about 90 % of its initial mass. VDC changed significantly the polyacrylonitrile thermal behavior, decreasing the polymer degradation temperature by about 40 - 50 ¬∞C...|$|R
5000|$|An {{extremely}} different {{variant of}} the Batsuit is featured in Batman Beyond (1999-2001) which does away with the traditional individual articles of clothing {{and appears to be}} a simple black bodysuit with a red chest emblem and the cowl also covers the entire face. However, this version is a form fitting [...] "powered suit" [...] similar to an artificial powered exoskeleton. This fourth major Batsuit was originally designed by Bruce Wayne himself to aid his aging body (as the series' storyline was set at the DCAU's chronological end), but Terry McGinnis becomes the suit's primary wearer once Wayne retires. This Batsuit is unlike any other one in the DCAU. It gave Terry increased strength and equipped with sophisticated built-in gadgets (similar to Jean Paul Valley's variant). Of its many features, the most frequently used are a set of retractable wings and jet boots which together allow for flight, an active camouflage system which renders him nearly invisible, and a two-way radio and video link system that allows Bruce to see and hear everything Terry does and give advice and communicate. The suit features microphone recorders in the fingertips permitting eavesdropping and recording conversations either from a distance or through a wall. His signature weapon the batarang is now stored in a magazine. An automatic launcher built in the wrists places one or multiple foldable circle shaped batarangs for instant throwing (the suit most likely has a ballistics computer for calculating trajectories for throwing as shown when Terry attempted to throw a batarang while not wearing the suit and missed). The suit is flexible enough to be folded and stored in a backpack. It offers mild ballistic protection, <b>flame</b> resistance, radiation <b>resistant</b> (albeit not for prolonged exposure), is durable enough to offer the wearer resistance to blunt force trauma or significant impact (allowing the wearer to withstand punches from beings with super strength). Its original utility belt was capsulized like the original design from Batman: The Animated Series. It is also revealed that the suit's technology was designed by prosthesis scientist Dr. Peter Corso. Repeated encounters with Inque led Bruce to add electroshock circuitry to protect Terry or to disable an opponent. This Batsuit design was re-used in the feature film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000) as well as the crossover The Zeta Project and even post-series crossovers Static Shock and Justice League Unlimited. In the Justice League Unlimited episode [...] "Epilogue" [...] (set during the Batman Beyond era), minor changes show Terry has more traditional pouches like the designs from The New Batman Adventures and Justice League.|$|R
