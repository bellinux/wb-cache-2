500|$|Durian {{trees are}} large, growing to [...] in height {{depending}} on the species. The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to oblong and [...] long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four or six) petals. Durian trees {{have one or two}} flowering and fruiting periods per year, although the timing varies {{depending on the}} species, cultivars, and localities. A typical <b>durian</b> <b>tree</b> can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species. Among the thirty known species of Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum. There are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, however, so other species with edible fruit may exist. The durian is somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit, an unrelated species.|$|E

[...] The pollen, nectar, and flower of coconut and durian trees, {{as well as}} the fruits of rambutan, fig and langsat trees, are consumed. Flying foxes will also eat mangoes and bananas. With fruit, the flying fox prefers the pulp, and slices open the rind to get it. With <b>durian</b> <b>tree</b> flowers, the flying fox can lick up the nectar without doing apparent damage to the flower.|$|E

500|$|A durian {{falling on}} a person's head can cause serious {{injuries}} {{because it is}} heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit. Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious effusion of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt. A saying in Indonesian, ketiban durian runtuh, which translates to [...] "getting a durian avalanche", {{is the equivalent of}} the English phrase [...] "windfall gain". Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under <b>durian</b> <b>trees</b> are found in Indonesia. Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between <b>durian</b> <b>trees</b> in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid {{in the collection of the}} mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.|$|R
5000|$|Nonthaburi Province {{is renowned}} for growing the best durian in the country. The best durian farms are {{next to the}} river. Durian has been a {{well-known}} fruit in this province for 400 years. The fruit is known as [...] "durian Nont" [...] which means durian from Nonthaburi Province. It {{is also known as}} the most expensive durian in the world. There are six groups of Nonthaburi durian which are Kop, Luang, Kan Yao, Kampan, Thong Yoi, and miscellaneous. Most durian orchards are near rivers such as the Chao Phraya. This is because the soil next to the river is good for planting which is also good for <b>durian</b> <b>trees.</b> However, the majority of durian orchards have disappeared because of flooding and pollution. [...] The price of durian Non depends on its group. Kan Yao is the most expensive, starting from around 10,000 baht and can be up to 20,000 baht (or about US$600) for one durian. The Kan Yao itself is not easy to find in normal markets. The main reason for the high price is because it is rare. The recent flood in 2011 cleared out almost all of the <b>durian</b> <b>trees</b> in Nonthaburi, and only a few trees have been newly planted. Also, residential areas are expanding into agricultural areas.|$|R

60|$|I {{afterwards}} shot two adult {{females and}} two young ones of different ages, all of which I preserved. One of the females, with several young ones, was feeding on a <b>Durian</b> <b>tree</b> with unripe fruit; {{and as soon as}} she saw us she began breaking off branches and the great spiny fruits with every appearance of rage, causing such a shower of missiles as effectually kept us from approaching too near the tree. This habit of throwing down branches when irritated has been doubted, but I have, as here narrated, observed it myself on at least three separate occasions. It was however always the female Mias who behaved in this way, {{and it may be that}} the male, trusting more to his great strength and his powerful canine teeth, is not afraid of any other animal, and does not want to drive them away, while the parental instinct of the female leads her to adopt this mode of defending herself and her young ones.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has often}} been said that no animal uses any tool; but the {{chimpanzee}} {{in a state of}} nature cracks a native fruit, somewhat like a walnut, with a stone.[67] Rengger[68] easily taught an American monkey thus to break open hard palm-nuts, and afterwards of its own accord it used stones to open other kinds of nuts, as well as boxes. It thus also removed the soft rind of fruit that had a disagreeable flavour. Another monkey was taught to open the lid of a large box with a stick, and afterwards it used the stick as a lever to move heavy bodies; and I have myself seen a young orang put a stick into a crevice, slip his hand to the other end, and use it in the proper manner as a lever. In the cases just mentioned stones and sticks were employed as implements; but they are likewise used as weapons. Brehm[69] states, on the authority of the well-known traveller Schimper, that in Abyssinia when the baboons belonging to one species (C. gelada) descend in troops from the mountains to plunder the fields, they sometimes encounter troops of another species (C. hamadryas), and then a fight ensues. The Geladas roll down great stones, which the Hamadryas try to avoid, and then, both species, making a great uproar, rush furiously against each other. Brehm, when accompanying the Duke of Coburg-Gotha, aided in an attack with fire-arms on a troop of baboons in the pass of Mensa in Abyssinia. The baboons in return rolled so many stones down the mountain, some as large as a man’s head, that the attackers had to beat a hasty retreat; and the pass was actually for a time closed against the caravan. It deserves notice that these baboons thus acted in concert. Mr. Wallace[70] on three occasions saw female orangs, accompanied by their young, “breaking off branches and the great spiny fruit of the <b>Durian</b> <b>tree,</b> with every appearance of rage; causing such a shower of missiles as effectually kept us from approaching too near the tree.” ...|$|E

60|$|Near the landing-place {{we found}} a fine house, 250 feet long, raised high above the ground on posts, with a wide {{verandah}} and still wider platform of bamboo in front of it. Almost all the people, however, were away on some excursion after edible birds'-nests or bees'-wax, and there only remained in the house two or three old {{men and women with}} a lot of children. The mountain or hill was close by, covered with a complete forest of fruit-trees, among which the Durian and Mangosteen were very abundant; but the fruit was not yet quite ripe, except a little here and there. I spent a week at this place, going out everyday in various directions about the mountain, accompanied by a Malay, who had stayed with me while the other boatmen returned. For three days we found no Orangs, but shot a deer and several monkeys. On the fourth day, however, {{we found a}} Mias feeding on a very lofty <b>Durian</b> <b>tree,</b> and succeeded in killing it, after eight shots. Unfortunately it remained in the tree, hanging by its hands, and we were obliged to leave it and return home, as it was several miles off. As I felt pretty sure it would fall during the night, I returned to the place early the next morning, and found it on the ground beneath the tree. To my astonishment and pleasure, it appeared to be a different kind from any I had yet seen; for although a full-grown male, by its fully developed teeth and very large canines, it had no sign of the lateral protuberance on the face, and was about one-tenth smaller in all its dimensions than the other adult males. The upper incisors, however, appeared to be broader than in the larger species, a character distinguishing the Simia morio of Professor Owen, which he had described from the cranium of a female specimen. As it was too far to carry the animal home, I set to work and skinned the body on the spot, leaving the head, hands, and feet attached, to be finished at home. This specimen is now in the British Museum.|$|E

However, chiropterophily in the Old World and the pollination roles of large bats, such as flying foxes (Pteropus spp., Acerodon spp., Desmalopex spp.), are still poorly understood and require further elucidation. Efforts {{to protect these}} bats have been hampered {{by a lack of}} basic quantitative information on their role as ecosystem service providers. Here, we investigate the role of the locally endangered island flying fox Pteropus hypomelanus in the pollination ecology of durian (Durio zibethinus), an economically important crop in Southeast Asia. On Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia, we deployed 19 stations of paired infrared camera and video traps across varying heights at four individual flowering <b>trees</b> in a <b>durian</b> orchard. We detected at least nine species of animal visitors, but only bats had mutualistic interactions with durian flowers. There was a clear vertical stratification in the feeding niches of flying foxes and nectar bats, with flying foxes feeding at greater heights in the trees. Flying foxes had a positive effect on mature fruit set and therefore serve as important pollinators for <b>durian</b> <b>trees.</b> As such, semi-wild durian trees—particularly tall ones—may be dependent on flying foxes for enhancing reproductive success. Our study is the first to quantify the role of flying foxes in durian pollination, demonstrating that these giant fruit bats may have far more important ecological, evolutionary, and economic roles than previously thought. This has important implications and can aid efforts to promote flying fox conservation, especially in Southeast Asian countries. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} phenological patterns of mature <b>durian</b> <b>trees</b> {{grown in the}} north of Queensland, Australia, and monitored the distribution of phosphonate following trunk injection at three distinct phenological periods, to identify the injection period which results in maximum uptake in all <b>tree</b> organs. <b>Durian</b> cultivars Gumpun, Parung and Gob Yaow were injected with 16 g a. i. phosphonate at each of three injection periods (early flowering fruit/fruit-set, mid-fruit-set, and immediately after harvest). In northern Queensland, durian shoot and root development appears to be active throughout the year despite the relatively cool conditions that occur during winter. Shoot-flushing activity often occurs in parts of the tree rather then uniformly over the canopy. Phosphonate was detected within two days of injection in all organs sampled and reached a peak between four and eight days after injection. The highest levels of phosphonate were recorded in leaves and flowers (mean value of 60 and 40 μg/g dry weight). Phosphonate levels either declined or increased with sampling date, depending on organ and injection time, but persisted in all tissues for at least 128 days. Phosphonate trunk injection trials were also carried out on local durian varieties in Vietnam. Under moderate disease pressure, annual injections of 16 g a. i. per tree gave superior control of canker compared with recommended sprays of metalaxyl or Aliette. Under high disease pressure, 48 g a. i., injected at 3 three-monthly intervals, gave the best disease control. Results presented in this paper demonstrate the efficacy of phosphonate in controlling phytophthora diseases in durian when applied as a trunk injection...|$|R

Young children perceive outdoor environment such as forest, camp ground and park as playscape offering a variety of functional properties called affordances. This study presents empirical findings on a phenomenological inquiry on young children's behavioral responses experiencing orchard and forest in Perak, Malaysia. Through a participatory investigation on 18 middle childhood boys, the authors documented sensorial and motoric actions of the children using note taking and tape recording. The behavioral data were analyzed in two ways: levels of affordances and taxonomy of affordances. The two-day experience revealed 65 affordances which was dominated by utilized affordances (n= 38), followed by perceived affordances (n= 23), and lastly, shaped affordances (n= 4). The result suggests the children were active in performatory and exploratory activities such as hiking on trail, picking fallen durian fruits, plucking leaves, climbing slippery slopes, holding treelets and rattan climbers to climb slopes, ducking under fallen log, picking pebbles from stream bed, throwing pebbles on water surface, and many more. These motoric activities were associated or generated by perceiving the orchard and forest features including scanning trails and forest floor, hearing sound of birds and cicadas, observing water cascade and water striders, avoiding touching spiny rattans, and more. Finally, in the taxonomy of affordances, most of the children's performances were with vegetations, examples were observing <b>durian</b> fruits on <b>tree</b> branches, searching fallen fruits, grasping fruit stalks, picking attractive yellow pods, breaking pods with fingers, and seeing marble-like seeds in the pods.

Financially, the agroforestry system with MPTS in Southeast Sulawesi is worth undertaking because it is profitable. From the farmers point of view, the marketing of langsat, durian, coconut and cocoa is not competitive, since farmers are on the weak side in the price information process. The results of the analysis of price transmision elasticity, the index of market integration in the short-run and in the long-run, show that the market for the above mentioned commodities is not integrated. The reason for this is because of the inefficiency and deficiency in the availability of market information. The institutional system in the marketing process of the commodities offered by the farmersis relatively informal. In the marketing process of langsat, durian and coconut, the relationship between farmers and traders can be described as clientelism (patron-client). On the other hand, in the marketing of cocoa, the farmers have a fixed relationship with their market institutions like papalele, whereby the farmers receive working capital from local traders to harvest and to produce and sale the cocoa to the local market.
