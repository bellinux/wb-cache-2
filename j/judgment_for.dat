40|$|This study {{examined}} the interplay of taxonomic and contextual knowledge in cross-classification by assessing the interaction of taxonomic and ecological knowledge in folk biology. Stimuli were pairs of animal species in which {{the presence or absence}} of taxonomic and ecological relations was manipulated orthogonally. Participants judged whether each pair was related taxonomically and ecologically; we measures speed and accuracy. Presence of taxonomic relations facilitated ecological <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> ecologically related pairs, and hindered <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> unrelated pairs. In contrast, although ecological relations hindered taxonomic <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> taxonomically unrelated pairs, they failed to facilitate <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> taxonomically related pairs. These results underscore the interactive nature of different conceptual systems for cross-classified categories and suggest a disproportionally strong influence of taxonomic categories...|$|R

5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered <b>judgment</b> <b>for</b> Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Judge José A. Cabranes {{presided over}} {{the case in the}} United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In order to defeat a defense motion to dismiss the case in 1987, the plaintff called a number of expert {{witnesses}} including psychologist Margaret Singer, author of Cults in Our Midst, and psychiatrist and neurologist James Merikangas. Both Singer and Merikangas submitted affidavits asserting that Slee's death was related to the est training. After the defendants refused to respond to discovery requests, on January 18, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion for default <b>judgment,</b> <b>for</b> failure of the defendants to comply with discovery, which was denied. In 1991, before the case came to trial, defendant Erhard left the country. In 1992, a jury heard the wrongful death lawsuit.

40|$|The {{sense of}} agency, the {{experience}} of being responsible for the external effects of our actions, is pervasive, but the mechanism of this sensation is not well understood. Recent research has focused on a `comparator model' in which implicit comparisons between predicted and experienced sensory input drive the sense of agency. However, this cannot account for occasions when one feels responsible for an unpredicted outcome, like accidentally knocking over a glass. This study examined whether such judgments involve a more cognitively demanding interpretive process by comparing the effect of a cognitively taxing verbal shadowing task on agency <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> expected and unexpected action-consistent outcomes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that agency <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> unexpected action-outcomes were not more susceptible to interference from verbal shadowing than <b>judgments</b> <b>for</b> expected action-outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary <b>judgment</b> <b>for</b> the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E

In contrast to the prediction of Support Theory (Tversky & Koehler, 1994), we found no evidence that unpacking has a nonnegative effect on probability judgments (subadditivity). Instead, we found a negative effect with low representative direct unpackings (superadditivity). Our data suggest that probability judgments are proportional to the typicality of instances in the description...|$|R

The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment.
