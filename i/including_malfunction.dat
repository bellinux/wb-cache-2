By early 1960, the Howard Frankland Bridge was opened to traffic, as well as the segment from the Hillsborough Avenue/US 301 junction in Tampa to Plant City. The stretch from Lake Monroe to Lake Helen, including the original St. Johns River Bridge also opened during that period. The segment from Tampa to Orlando was complete by 1962. By the mid 1960s, several segments were already complete, <b>including</b> <b>Malfunction</b> Junction in Tampa and parts of I-4 through Orlando. The original western terminus was set at Central Avenue (County Road 150) in St. Petersburg, though a non-Interstate extension would have continued south and west to Pasadena. Proposed I-4 was later extended southwest to the present location of exit 20, with a planned temporary end at US 19 and 13th Avenue South, and a continuation to the Sunshine Skyway was also designated as part of Interstate 4. Construction was stalled at 9th Street North (CR 803) for several years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeuropathological {{investigations}} have identified major hallmarks of chronic neurodegenerative disease. These include protein aggregates called Lewy bodies in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. Mutations in the α-synuclein gene {{have been found}} in familial disease and this has led to intense focused research in vitro and in transgenic animals to mimic and understand Parkinson's disease. A decade of transgenesis has lead to overexpression of wild type and mutated α-synuclein, but without faithful reproduction of human neuropathology and movement disorder. In particular, widespread regional neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra associated with human disease has not been described. The intraneuronal protein aggregates (inclusions) in all of the human chronic neurodegenerative diseases contain ubiquitylated proteins. There could be several reasons for the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, <b>including</b> <b>malfunction</b> of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). This hypothesis has been genetically tested in mice by conditional deletion of a proteasomal regulatory ATPase gene. The consequences of gene ablation in the forebrain include extensive neuronal death and the production of Lewy-like bodies containing ubiquitylated proteins as in dementia with Lewy bodies. Gene deletion in catecholaminergic neurons, including in the substantia nigra, recapitulates the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{increased}} susceptibility of {{the elderly}} to infection presents a major challenge to public health services. An aging immune system is well documented {{as the cause of}} increased infection rates in elderly people. Such immunosenescence is multi-factorial and incompletely understood. Immunosenescent changes <b>include</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> of innate immune system cellular receptors; involution of the thymus, with consequent reduction of the naïve T cell population; alteration of the T cell population composition; modified phenotypes of individual T cells; and replicative senescence of memory cells expressing naïve markers. Unfortunately, immunosenescence also renders vaccination less effective in the elderly. It is therefore important that the vaccines used against common but preventable diseases, such as influenza, are specifically enhanced to overcome the reduced immune responsiveness of this vulnerable population. </p...|$|R

Results show of the two energy sources examined diesel fuel consumed accounted for 98 % of the total energy inputs over the years under review. The balance of 2 % was in the form of manual energy. The minimum and maximum values of energy use ratios were 11. 3 : 1 and 31. 1 : 1 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. A correlation between energy inputs and outputs with R 2 value of 0. 94 was obtained.

Thus, the results of energy use obtained from the industries are incomplete because the MTR energy plays a significant role in energy use analysis. The significance of the results obtained in this work is that since the level of use of each energy source was determined, the agro-allied industry would be able to relate energy use with commodity production so as to enhance production with minimum energy input...|$|R
