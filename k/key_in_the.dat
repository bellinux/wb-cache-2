5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E

5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively conservative in its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to {{the founding of the}} MDRM, which many non-Merina feared would revive Merina political hegemony, the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed in June 1946 by members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Militant leader Mahasampo Raveloson was <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation of the party. Other founding members included Philibert Tsiranana (who became Madagascar's first president after independence), Albert Sylla (who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under Tsiranana, and whose son, Jacques Sylla, would go on to become Prime Minister of Madagascar under Marc Ravalomanana), and Pascale Velonjara, father-in-law of future president Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by Billie Piper in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and {{was created by}} series producer Russell T Davies. With the revival of Doctor Who in 2005, Rose was introduced as a new travelling companion of series protagonist, the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character, intended {{to act as an}} audience surrogate, was <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first series to introduce new viewers to the mythos of Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. Piper received top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant for the duration of her time as a regular cast member. A regular for all of series one (2005) and series two (2006), Piper later returned for three episodes of the programme's fourth series (2008) and appeared in feature-length specials in both 2010 and 2013.|$|E

5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative {{use of the term}} appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{commanded}} {{an elite}} enforcer {{group known as}} Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army during the 5 November 2010 shootout in Matamoros {{that resulted in the}} drug lord's death. Los Escorpiones reportedly set up roadblocks, rocket-propelled grenade attacks, and snipers to prevent the capture of their leader. According to the PGR and the Mexican Armed Forces, the group was originally formed by Antonio Ezequiel in 2002 as a parallel to his brother's personal army, Los Zetas. However, his brother Osiel never approved of the group's creation and subsequently cut all communication with him, although he allowed him to work on his own. Known for their brutal tactics, Los Escorpiones is composed of at least 60 former state, judicial, and municipal police officers. The enforcer group served as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, and they were <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territorial war against Los Zetas in Reynosa and Matamoros {{in the first half of}} 2010.|$|E
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home <b>key.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
