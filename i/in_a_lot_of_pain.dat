2500|$|In October 1980, Julia Cave and a {{team from}} the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the {{documentary}} Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. The Times wrote of the documentary: [...] "An incredulous smile froze on my lips as I watched the Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Could I be absolutely positive {{it was all a}} lot of eyewash? Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." [...] At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, Egypt: Quest for Eternity. It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served as a priestess 3,000 years before.|$|E
2500|$|There was an {{international}} controversy {{about the death}} of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a snow-balling series of interviews, allegations, critiques, and peace-making. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die, and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal. He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a [...] "loose group", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide. It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him. Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis revealed {{in an interview with the}} press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang [...] below the summit, without attempting a rescue. Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed [...] "Green Boots", but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman named Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was [...] "...physically and mentally exhausted, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> He had suffered severe frostbite — he later had five fingertips amputated." [...] When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for $7,490USD, believed to be the whole financial cost. Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to $100,000USD plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses. It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summitted Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down. On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia, and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the North Side route.|$|E

Summers sought further medical advice, and ultimately the original diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia was confirmed. Chemotherapy would go on for the next 2 years for him, which he described as [...] "brutal". Summers has had PET scans ever since his chemo finished, and as of 2016, he is in remission.|$|E
50|$|Paediatric {{radiology}} {{comes with}} many challenges. Unlike adults, children cannot always understand / comprehend {{a change of}} environment. Therefore, staff are usually required to wear colourful uniforms, usually 'scrubs', {{as opposed to a}} normal hospital uniform. It is also important to recognise that when a child is unwell, they follow their instincts, which is usually to cry and stay close to their parents. This presents a huge challenge for the radiographer, who must try to gain the child's trust and gain their co-operation. Once co-operation has been achieved there is another big challenge of keeping the child still for their imaging test. This can be very difficult for children <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> Coercion and support from parents is usually enough to achieve this, however, in some extreme cases (such as MRI and CT), {{it may be necessary to}} sedate the child.|$|E

When Rodrigo asks about the snoring sound he hears, Sawano says it's not snoring but the whimpering of three Christian believers who have been hanged upside down for the past six hours. Sawano says he was in the same cell where Rodrigo is now and was hanged for two days and there were five men who were hanged in the pit, and he can still hear their voices. Sawano tells the real reason he renounced his faith was not because of the torture, but the absence of God in others' suffering. Rodrigo replies those who are in suffering will receive eternal happiness for their pain. Sawano tells him not to deceive himself, and says if Rodrigo renounces his faith now for the sake of love as Christ would do, those men hanged in the pits will be freed and receive immediate care.|$|E

Later on,all the jews in Lublinske were gathered up by German soldiers and being taken into the Parczew Forest and where they would probably be killed. Yossel decides to attack the Germans and the jews run away during this encounter. Shayna decides they should come back and check on Yossel and we find the dismembered bodies of the German soldiers and Yossel alive near the riverbank. Yossel has a dozen bullet wounds,some bayonett stab wounds, and was visibly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain.</b> Yossel asks Shayna to remove the Shema because that would signify him completing his mission and {{he would be able to}} die.
