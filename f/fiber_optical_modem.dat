40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} {{have been}} an important tool in biology and physics for studying single molecules and colloidal systems. Most of current optical tweezers are built with microscope objectives, which are: i) expensive, ii) bulky and hard to integrate, iii) sensitive to environmental fluctuations, iv) limited in terms of working distances from the substrate, and v) rigid with the requirements on the substrate (transparent substrate made with glass and with a fixed thickness). These limitations of objective-based optical tweezers prevent them from being miniaturized. <b>Fiber</b> <b>optical</b> tweezers can provide a solution for cost reduction and miniaturization, and these optical tweezers can be potentially used in microfluidic systems. However, the existing <b>fiber</b> <b>optical</b> tweezers have the following limitations: i) low trapping efficiency due to weakly focused beams, ii) lack {{of the ability to}} control the positions of multiple particles simultaneously, and iii) limited functionalities.
