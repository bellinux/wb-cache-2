40|$|Background Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are {{designed}} to deliver shocks or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of ventricular arrhythmias. During follow-up, some ICD recipients experience the sensation of ICD discharge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of an actual discharge (phantom shock). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of phantom shocks in ICD recipients. Methods Medical records of 629 consecutive patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and prior ICD implantation were studied. Results With a median follow-up of 35 months, phantom shocks were reported by 5. 1 % of ICD recipients (5. 7 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>prevention</b> group and 3. 7 % for <b>the</b> secondary <b>prevention</b> group; p=NS). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> combined group of primary and secondary prevention, there were no significant predictors of the occurrence of phantom shocks. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>prevention</b> group, phantom shocks were related to a history of atrial fibrillation (p= 0. 03) and NYHA class <III (p= 0. 05). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> secondary <b>prevention</b> group, there were no significant predictors for phantom shocks. Conclusion Phantom shocks occur in approximately 5 % of all ICD recipients. In primary prevention patients, a relation with a history of atrial fibrillation and NYHA class <III were significant predictors for the occurrence of phantom shocks. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> secondary <b>prevention</b> patients, no significant predictors were foun...|$|R
