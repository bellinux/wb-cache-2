5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E

25|$|John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley {{propose that}} dreams {{are caused by}} the random firing of neurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex during the REM period. Neatly, this theory <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> irrationality of the mind during REM periods, as, according to this theory, the forebrain then creates a story {{in an attempt to}} reconcile and make sense of the nonsensical sensory information presented to it. This would explain the odd nature of many dreams.|$|E
25|$|Postconstructivism {{benefited from}} a natural {{reaction}} against both the avantgarde and the eclectics of the past. It was perceived as new, {{and at the same}} time allowed grand buildings that were to the taste of provincial elite.

This <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> spread of Postconstructivism in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius {{would not be enough}} to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why {{the first phase of the}} layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.|$|E
25|$|To most Americans, {{the quick}} {{succession}} of {{events at the}} end of the war (the burning of the capital, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Treaty of Ghent) appeared as though American valor at New Orleans had forced the British to surrender after almost winning. This view, while inaccurate, strongly contributed to the post-war euphoria that persisted for a decade. It also <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> significance of the war, even if it was strategically inconclusive. Napoleon was defeated for the last time at the Battle of Waterloo near the end of Madison's presidency, and as the Napoleonic Wars ended, so did the War of 1812. Madison's final years began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, which was called the Era of Good Feelings. Madison's reputation as president improved and Americans finally believed the United States had established itself as a world power.|$|E

500|$|Littlebear {{believes}} the book <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> historical {{origins of the}} modern attitudes of the Northern Cheyenne towards other tribes. [...] For instance, the Crow are traditionally enemies of the Cheyenne and the Sioux are traditionally allies. [...] Littlebear says that although he knew of these prejudices, {{he did not understand}} the underlying reasons until he read this book. [...] Ted Rising Sun's humorous claim that the alliance with the Sioux was only because the Cheyenne [...] "needed someone to hold the horses" [...] only emphasises their friendship. [...] This claim, repeated by others, possibly originated because after the Sioux's migration into the Black Hills region, they obtained their first horses from the Cheyenne. [...] Ted Rising Sun is a descendant of Chief Dull Knife, a major figure in Cheyenne history and a contemporary of Wooden Leg.|$|E
500|$|Although Charles and Mary Blackstone {{were members}} of the middle class rather than landed gentry, they were {{particularly}} prosperous. Tax records show Charles Blackstone to have been the second most prosperous man in the parish in 1722, and death registers show that the family had several servants. This, along with Thomas Bigg's assistance to the family following Charles' death, <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> educational upbringing of the children. William Blackstone was sent to Charterhouse School in 1730, nominated by Charles Wither, a relative of Mary Blackstone. William did well there, and became head of the school by age 15. [...] However, after Charles' death the family fortunes declined, and after Mary died (5 January 1736) the family's resources largely went to meet unpaid bills. William was able to remain at Charterhouse as a [...] "poor scholar", having been named to that position in June 1735 after being nominated by Sir Robert Walpole.|$|E
500|$|The first {{reference}} to 3 John {{is in the}} middle of the third century; Eusebius says that Origen knew of both 2 and 3 John, however Origen is reported as saying [...] "all do not consider them genuine". Similarly, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Origen's pupil, was aware of a [...] "reputed Second or Third Epistle of John". Also around this time 3 John is thought to have been known in North Africa as it was referred to in the Sententiae Episcoporum produced by the Seventh Council of Carthage. There was doubt about the authority of 3 John, however, with Eusebius listing it and 2 John as [...] "disputed books" [...] despite describing them as [...] "well-known and acknowledged by most". Although Eusebius believed the Apostle wrote the Gospel and the epistles, it is likely that doubt about the fidelity of the author of 2 and 3 John was a factor in causing them to be disputed. By the end of the fourth century the Presbyter (author of 2 and 3 John) was thought to be a different person than the Apostle John. This opinion, although reported by Jerome, was not held by all, as Jerome himself attributed the epistles to John the Apostle. One factor which <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> late attestation of 3 John and the doubts about its authority is the very short nature of the letter; early writers may simply not have had occasion to quote from it.|$|E

[...] By using the cationic 2-aza-Cope/Mannich reaction on pyrrolizidine precursors, they showed that pyrrolizidines with cis substituents from E-alkenes and trans substituents from Z-alkenes are heavily favored, results that are indicative of a chair transition state. [...] If a boat transition state was operative, the opposite results would have been obtained (detailed in image below). [...] As is the trend with many reactions, conversion of the Z-enolate affords lower selectivity due to 1,3 diaxial steric interactions between the enolate and the ring, {{as well as the}} fact that substituents prefer quasi-equatorial positioning.

2500|$|This {{assimilation}} is {{also known}} to create [...] "intergenerational family conflict." [...] In contrast to their parents, second generation Asian Americans {{are less likely to}} tolerate racial stereotyping and racial discrimination, are more likely to marry non-Asians and are more aware of their minority status and the disadvantages associated with it. This has been linked to racism and discrimination experienced by minorities in the U.S. as this heightened sensitivity is common among all second generation groups of minority status, and this heightened sensitivity evokes an enhanced drive for success. This focus on success, in combination with the common Asian cultural value of family honor, <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> high educational successes seen by second generation Asian immigrants. College graduation rates are relatively high among second generation Asian Americans, with the two highest rates seen among the Chinese and Indian second generation.|$|E
