We describe the procedure of a transfemoral-transseptal implantation of the second-generation CardiAQ mitral valve bioprosthesis and 30 -day follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: The procedure was performed percutaneously, without any left <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support. The patient had severe mitral regurgitation with severely depressed ventricular function and other comorbidities. The patient was deemed extreme high risk for conventional cardiac surgery by a multidisciplinary team. The main procedural steps were the creation of an arteriovenous loop with an exchange nitinol wire, and the use of a customised "steerable snare system" to facilitate the catheter delivery system into the mitral annulus. Transoesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy were utilised for device positioning and deployment. The mitral valve prosthesis was implanted with mild mitral regurgitation. The postoperative course was uneventful and at 30 -day follow-up the patient is in NYHA Class I, with good function of the mitral valve bioprosthesis.

40|$|Abstract — Over {{the past}} few decades, {{we have seen a}} tremen-dous {{progress}} in the development of implantable ventricular assist devices (VAD). However, these devices are mainly devel-oped for adult patients. For the patients under age 5 who have chronic heart failures, physicians must resort to <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support devices which often result in infection, thromboembolism, or excessive blood transfusions. In this paper, we describe a design process for a pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD). The central part of the device is a magnetically levitated rotating pump which creates a pressure rise (∼ 100 mmHg) at a required flow rate (∼ 0. 5 L/min) suitable for infants and small children. We have considered several different pump topologies, of which an axial mixed– flow pump configuration was chosen for further development. The pump impeller is supported by two radial permanent– magnet passive bearings. The rotor–dynamics analysis of the pump shows that the critical speeds of the pump are affected by the radial and yaw stiffnesses of the PM bearings. Hence, analytical expressions for the stiffnesses are derived and verified through FEA. In contrast to the radial suspension, the axial motion of the impeller is actively controlled using a voice– coil actuator. A toroidally–wound motor drives the pump with high efficiency and little additional negative radial stiffness. The design process relies heavily on optimization at the component– level and system–level. The preliminary results of the design optimization are presented in this paper. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAnomalous {{origin of}} left {{coronary}} artery from pulmonary artery {{is a very}} rare disease with incidence of one every 300, 000 live births. It has a high mortality of 80 % {{in the first year}} of life. This observational study summarized our experience using the technique of subclavian arterial bypass without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for treatment of this coronary anomaly in pediatric population. The study aims to revive an earlier technique, with modifications, as an alternative to the existing coronary translocation. MethodsFrom 2009 till 2015, six consecutive infants were operated by a single surgeon using subclavian artery to left coronary artery bypass done off pump, to establish a two coronary circulation. ResultsFive patients had an improvement in their LV ejection fractions at the time of the last follow-up. Angiography done in two cases after 2 and 6 years after surgery revealed good flow in the left coronary artery and good growth in the length of subclavian artery. There was one surgical mortality in this series. ConclusionsThe technique of off pump subclavian arterial bypass for anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a viable alternative to the existing standard technique of coronary translocation. It essentially eliminates <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support or a left heart bypass that may be needed after coronary translocation. Also, the advantage of avoiding CPB, both in economic terms and also the adverse effects related to use of bypass in this very sick hearts, cannot be disregarded...|$|R

40|$|Extracorporeal {{circulation}} provides critical {{life support}} {{in the face of}} cardiopulmonary or renal failure, but it also introduces a host of unique morbidities characterized by edema formation, cardiac insufficiency, autonomic dysfunction, and altered vasomotor function. We tested the hypothesis that cyclohexanone (CHX), a solvent used in production of extracorporeal circuits and intravenous (IV) bags, leaches into the contained fluids and can replicate these clinical morbidities. Crystalloid fluid samples from circuits and IV bags were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to provide a range of clinical CHX exposure levels, revealing CHX contamination of sampled fluids (9. 63 – 3, 694 μg/l). In vivo rat studies were conducted (n = 49) to investigate the effects of a bolus IV infusion of CHX vs. saline alone on cardiovascular function, baroreflex responsiveness, and edema formation. Cardiovascular function was evaluated by cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, vascular resistance, arterial pressure, and ventricular contractility. Baroreflex function was assessed by mean femoral arterial pressure responses to bilateral carotid occlusion. Edema formation was assessed by the ratio of wet to dry organ weights for lungs, liver, kidneys, and skin. CHX infusion led to systemic hypotension; pulmonary hypertension; depressed contractility, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output; and elevated vascular resistance (P < 0. 05). Mean arterial pressure responsiveness to carotid occlusion was dampened after CHX infusion (from + 17. 25 ± 1. 8 to + 5. 61 ± 3. 2 mmHg; P < 0. 05). CHX infusion led to significantly higher wet-to-dry weight ratios vs. saline only (3. 8 ± 0. 06 vs. 3. 5 ± 0. 05; P < 0. 05). CHX can reproduce clinical cardiovascular, neurological, and edema morbidities associated with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> treatment...|$|R

Patterns were always the same for a given heart. PO 2 distribution in the vasculature measured by Pd-porphine phosphorescence showed patterns similar to the NADH fluorescence patterns. Microsphere embolization of the capillaries, but not of arterioles, elicited identical NADH fluorescence patterns as seen during recovery from anoxia without microspheres.

40|$|Objective: <b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support (ECS) is a {{life-saving}} {{technique and}} its use is increasing in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A meta-analysis on pooled event rate of short-term mortality and complications of ACS patients treated with ECS was performed. Data sources: Articles were searched in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Biomed Central. Study selection: Inclusion criteria: observational studies on ACS patients treated with ECS. Primary outcome: short-term mortality. Secondary outcomes: ECS-related complications, causes of death, long-term mortality and bridge therapy. Data extraction: Sixteen articles were selected. Data about clinical characteristics, ACS diagnosis and treatment, ECS setting, outcome definitions and event rate were retrieved from the articles. Random-effect meta-analytic pooling was performed reporting results as a summary point estimate and 95 % confidence interval. Data synthesis: A total of 739 patients were included (mean age 59. 8 ± 2. 9). The event rate of short-term mortality was 58 % (95 % CI, 51 - 64 %), 6 -month mortality was affecting 24 % (95 %CI, 5 %- 63 %) of 1 -month survivors and 1 -year mortality 17 % (95 %CI, 6 %- 40 %) of 6 -month survivors. The event rates of ECS-related complications were: acute renal failure 41 %, bleeding 25 %, neurologic damage in survivors 21 %, sepsis/infections 21 % and leg ischemia 12 %.

40|$|Aims: The {{morbidity}} and mortality of surgical aortic valve replacement are increased in elderly patients with multiple high risk comorbid conditions. Percutaneous prosthetic aortic valve replacement (PAVR) via the femoral arterial approach is feasible in selected patients, who are poor operative candidates, with satisfactory short term outcomes. It is conceivable that patients with poor LV function may benefit from periprocedural cardio-circulatory support. We evaluated the short-term safety and efficacy of using the TandemHeart® PTVA® System (p-LVAD) to deliver <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support in patients undergoing PAVR. Methods and results: Between April 2006 and May 2007 the TandemHeart® was used in 10 patients (age: range 64 - 85, median 80) undergoing elective PAVR using the CoreValve™ Revalving System. The median (range) time for implementation of circulatory support was 32 (22 - 40) minutes. A pump flow up to 4. 6 L/min was achieved. Systemic haemodynamics were maintained {{in all but one}} patient. The median (range) systemic arterial pressure (MBP) was 77 (67 - 89) mmHg at baseline and 76 (61 - 91) mmHg after pump functioning. A major systolic blood pressure drop (systolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg, pulse pressure < 10 mmHg, occurred in one patient due to PAVR related pericardial tamponade. Median (range) duration of support was 64 (60 - 93) minutes. Successful weaning was achieved in all patients. There was one in hospital death. Survival at 12 months was 90 %, at 15 months 70 %. Vascular access site complications were seen in two patients. One patient suffered a mild to moderate access site bleeding, one a local wound infection. There was no technical device failure. Conclusions: The TandemHeart-PTVA® may provide a valuable safeguard during high risk PAVR procedures and enables precise delivery of the CoreValve prosthesis. The rate of device related cardiac and vascular complications was acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Some acute {{myocarditis}} is refractory {{to conventional}} therapies including IASP and is rapidly culminating in death without <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support. In order to study possible effectiveness of PCPS against this subgroup, acute fulminant myocarditis (AFM), {{we have reviewed}} our experiences and have examined the clinical outcome following PCPS treatment. Since 1986, we have applied emergency PCPS to 10 AFM pts (mean 38 years) with rapidly progressive cardiac dysfunction and sustained wide GRS VT/vf with hemodynamic collapse. The average interval from {{the onset of the}} very early signs of AFM (common cold like symptoms) to the induction of PCPS was 5. 2 days. IASP was routinely applied before, during and after PCPS. Nafamostat mesilate (1 mg/kg/hr,iv) was also administered in combination with Heparin (ACT> 200 sec) as prophylaxis for bleeding complications. Histological examinations obtained from 12 endomyocardial biopsies and 2 autopsies revealed various inflamatory changes in myocardium in all of the 8 pts examined. Although the courses and degree of recovery varied among the pts, PCPS could be eventually weaned in all pts after a mean of 167 hours (ranging 37 – 302 hours). After the removal of PCPS, 2 old pts (> 70 years) expired within 1 week due to sepsis and 1 pt expired 4 months later due to multiple organ failure. Seventy percent of pts (7 of 10) survived, 6 pts recovered to show normal cardiac function (mean EF= 0. 62) and 1 pt showed DCM like chronic heart failure (EF= 0. 321 Although nonsustained VT was observed in 3 of 7 survivors. they have been experiencing an event free follow-up period (mean 4. 8 years).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Transannular patch {{repair of}} tetralogy of Fallot leads to {{pulmonary}} insufficiency and progressive right ventricular dilatation {{responsible for a}} decreased exercise capacity. We studied the impact of late homograft insertion on the regression of the right ventricular volumes in symptomatic patients. METHODS: Between July 1992 and August 1996, 15 consecutive patients (age range: 4 to 24 years) were operated on at a median of 13 years (range: 3 to 20 years) after transannular patch repair of tetralogy of Fallot. All patients complained of exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Syncopes were reported in six patients and four patients had sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Fourteen had pulmonary regurgitation grade 3 or 4 and one had an associated stenosis and insufficiency. All patients had a dilated right ventricle. At reoperation, no patients presented with major aneurysm. The patch was resected and the right ventricular outflow tract reconstructed with a cryopreserved pulmonary homograft. Right ventricular volumes were studied before the procedures and at the last follow up consultation. RESULTS: There was no operative death. One patient who had a concomitant patch repair of a hypoplastic left pulmonary artery needed <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulatory</b> support for eight days. After a median follow up of 25 months (range: 3 to 54 months) all patients but one are in NYHA class I. There were no late deaths. The mean end-diastolic diameter of the right ventricle decreased from 36 +/- 9 mm before surgery to 31 +/- 6 mm (not significant). The mean ratio between the end-diastolic diameter of {{the right and left}} ventricles decreased from 0. 94 +/- 0. 3 to 0. 74 +/- 0. 2 (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: An increasing number of patients who had transannular patch repair for tetralogy of Fallot will require reoperation for symptomatic long-term pulmonary regurgitation. Homograft reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract of these patients induces regression of their right ventricular dilatation and leads to their functional recovery...|$|R

We sought {{to test the}} underlying hypothesis, i. e. that a monoamniotic state reduces the severity of TTTS. With use of our previously developed mathematical model of two equal fetoplacental <b>circulatory</b> <b>units</b> connected by various sizes and types of placental anastomoses, we compared the haemodynamic and amniotic fluid dynamics of monoamniotic and diamniotic twins that develop TTTS. We used three anastomotic patterns that produce severe, moderate or mild forms of TTTS, respectively, in our diamniotic-monochorionic twin model. Monoamnionicity was modelled by adding the two amniotic fluid volumes and using the volume-averaged amniotic fluid osmolality. The results were as follows: for severe TTTS, small differences develop between diamniotic and monoamniotic donor twins in fetal urine production, swallowed volume, blood volume, blood pressures, net fetofetal transfusion, and blood and amniotic fluid osmolality. However, the circulatory imbalance between the monoamniotic twins deteriorates {{similar to that of}} diamniotic twins. The pathophysiological differences tend to disappear for milder TTTS. In conclusion, our model suggests that the uncommon finding of TTTS in monoamniotic twins is not due to the presence of a single amniotic sac. Rather, clinically significant differences in anastomotic patterns and the delayed or lack of identification of manifestations in monoamniotic twins account for the reduced rate of TTTS diagnosis. Based on these results we expect the clinical disruption of the amnion septum in diamniotic-monochorionic TTTS pregnancies to have only minimal benefit...|$|R
