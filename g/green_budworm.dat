40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{with the objective}} of studying field responses of the <b>green</b> <b>budworm</b> moth, Hedya nubiferana (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Tor- tricidae), to pear ester [PE; ethyl (E,Z) - 2, 4 -decadienoate] and acetic acid (AA) with the aim of developing a lure attractive also for females. In the overwhelming majority of tests, traps baited with the PEAA lure (the com- bination of both PE and AA) caught more than traps baited with either of the constituents presented alone. PEAA lures were attractive to H. nubifer- ana no matter whether the two compounds were provided in separate dis- pensers or mixed together in a single one, and a large percentage (up to 71...|$|E
40|$|Hedya nubiferana (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a {{polyphagous}} pest damaging apple, pear, peach, plum {{and other related}} fruits. In tests conducted in Hungary, traps baited with a female-targeted lure [ethyl (E,Z) - 2, 4 -decadienoate (pear ester) + acetic acid; abbreviated later as PE+AA] caught comparable number of moths as pheromone baited traps. Traps with PE+AA lures caught (females and males together) on an average 30 % of the catch in traps baited with the synthetic <b>green</b> <b>budworm</b> moth sex pheromone (catching all males). This suggested that the PE+AA lure had a trapping performance comparable with that of pheromone traps, which latter are in practical use by farmers today. The seasonal flight patterns recorded with the PE+AA baited traps {{were similar to those}} with the sex pheromone baited ones, with respect to detection of beginning of flight and quantitative trends of catches during the flight. Consequently, the PE+AA lure shows potential for future practical applications as a female-targeted lure for H. nubiferana...|$|E
