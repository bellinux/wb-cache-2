40|$|Right lower {{quadrant}} pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common symptoms of the emergency patients. For accurate diagnosis and treatment; the patients must be questioned and examined very well. Also accompanying conditions due to right lower quadrant pain may be noticed. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case <b>presentation,</b> <b>we</b> discussed a patient who was presented with right lower quadrant pain and cervical dystonia. By limiting the usage of metoclopramide the patient was followed seamlessly. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case <b>presentation</b> <b>we</b> want to accentuate that a patient who with abdominal pain may be presented with rare symptoms such of dystonia. In such conditions a detailed anamnesis and physical examination are the first steps of the evaluation to prevent potential hazardous outcomes.
