50|$|As {{an option}} with this arrangement, if the vacuum is shut off prior to cure completion, as {{is called for}} in some applications, before the supply line is vented to atmosphere, the gauge line is backfilled with {{nitrogen}} from a zero-pressure gas regulator, thus preventing atmospheric contaminants from entering the breather/bleeder fabric. <b>Individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> of each vacuum line does not necessarily require gauge lines, nor does inert gas backfill.

50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip aerial protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|E
50|$|A well cluster, also {{referred}} to as a monitoring well cluster, consists of multiple co-located monitoring wells that are constructed with intakes (well screens) at different depths in the subsurface. The purpose of a well cluster is to provide groundwater samples from discrete depths at approximately the same location. Also, water levels can be measured in each <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> well, providing vertical profiles of groundwater pressure (hydraulic head). Well clusters are different from nested wells in that each monitoring well is constructed in a separate borehole, as opposed to multiple well casings in a single borehole which is the case with nested wells). A key advantage of a well cluster over a nested well is that there is less potential for vertical leakage and hydraulic short-circuiting because reliable annular seals are installed in each separate borehole in the cluster. However, well clusters require drilling multiple boreholes, which results in higher construction costs compared to nested wells. Economical alternatives to well clusters are multilevel groundwater monitoring systems, {{also referred}} to as engineered nested wells.|$|E

40|$|Part of {{the action}} of the EURADOS working group (European Radiation Dosimetry Group) on ‘Harmonisation of <b>Individual</b> <b>Monitoring</b> in Europe' was to {{investigate}} how the results from personal dosemeters for external radiation, from monitoring for internal exposure and from workplace monitoring, can be combined into a complete and consistent system of <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring.</b> To facilitate this work, the ‘EURADOS questionnaire Q 3 ' relating to radon and other natural sources of radiation in the workplace was distributed to relevant institutes across Europe. A total of 24 countries replied to the questionnaire. This study offers an important overview on actual regulations, national standards and reference levels for protection of employees from radon and other natural sources in different workplace scenarios. Information was also collected on <b>individual</b> <b>monitoring</b> and area monitoring to determine individual doses in workplaces with elevated levels of natural radiation.
