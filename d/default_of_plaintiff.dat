Loving, an {{attorney}} {{and former president of}} the Eastern Great Lakes Mission Center of the Community of Christ in Kirtland, Ohio, explained why the case was dismissed: [...] "Suffice it to say that, legally, the Court dismissed the <b>default</b> case <b>of</b> the <b>plaintiff,</b> the Reorganized Church, because it failed to allege or prove one of the essential elements of a statutory cause of action to quiet title in Ohio, that the plaintiff was in possession of the property. As such, the involuntary dismissal, or nonsuit, legally was not an adjudication on the merits of the truth or falsity <b>of</b> the <b>plaintiff’s</b> contentions. Findings <b>of</b> fact in such a case are not legally binding on anyone, least of all upon absent defendants. It could be inferred that E. L. Kelley should have known as much, but failed to broach or explore these ramifications with the leaders of the Church." ...|$|R

5000|$|A defendant's unjust {{enrichment}} is generally quantified using information {{resulting from the}} defendant's profits due to the misappropriation <b>of</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> trade secrets. [...] The laws on the loss of profits generally tends to favor the defendant, and if the lawsuit is filed early to stop the defendant's misappropriation <b>of</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> trade secrets, {{it might not be}} possible to quantify the wrongful enrichment damages. In such cases where {{it is not possible to}} measure the exact losses arising from wrongful enrichment, a royalty assessment in favor <b>of</b> <b>plaintiff</b> can help to fairly evaluate the value of its misappropriated trade secrets. Generally speaking a feasible value of royalty assessment should be done by expert who can measure the extent of misappropriation and can arrive at a fair conclusion accordingly.|$|R
