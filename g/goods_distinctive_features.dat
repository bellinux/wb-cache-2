Budući da je izraziti crkvenoslavenizam, ona je ujedno dobar razlikovni element u prepoznavanju ovih tekstova. Najčešće služi kao adjunktivna čestica ili kao parataktički veznik. Također je često i navezak drugim riječima uz koje je prvotno stajala kao pojačajna čestica. U ovom radu ispituje se status takvoga, izvorno pojačajnoga že, kao samostalne riječi u hrvatskome crkvenoslavenskome. The {{particle}} že {{is among}} the most frequent words in Croatian Glagolitic texts written in Croatian Church Slavonic Language. Furthermore, as a distinct Church Slavonic word it is a <b>good</b> <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> for the identification of such texts. It is often used as an adjunctive particle or a coordinating conjunction. We can also frequently find it in the function of a simple affix to different words with which it initially stood enhancing their meaning. This paper examines the status of that kind of že, the emphatic one, as an independent word in Croatian Church Slavonic. It is shown that the particle že – already only sporadically confirmed in its emphatic role in Old Church Slavonic with imperatives, question words or other words that carry emphasis – in the Croatian Glagolitic texts appears as a distinct archaism that, through various editorial interventions, was usually disposed of from the system. This might be attributed {{to the fact that the}} original Glagolitic texts were either adapted to Latin or created according to the Latin template, and that the Latin language did not have a corresponding particle. But its disappearance is more likely due to the fact that the Church Slavonic texts emerged in the area where the (Čakavian) Croatian language was spoken, in which že had probably already disappeared long since and functioned only as a phonetically changed affix -re...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> matrix to {{distinguish}} similar elements is identified with phonology, {{but there have been}} at least two efforts to use a <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> matrix in related fields. Close to phonology, and clearly acknowledging its debt to phonology, <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> have been used to describe and differentiate handshapes in fingerspelling in American Sign Language. <b>Distinctive</b> <b>features</b> have also been used to distinguish proverbs from other types of language such as slogans, clichés, and aphorisms.|$|R
40|$|Six pigeons were instrumentally {{trained to}} {{discriminate}} between two displays that differed only {{by the presence of}} a <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> on the positive or food-correlated display. In accordance with previous studies, subjects learned the discrimination and, {{in the presence of the}} positive display, directed most of their responses to the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature,</b> although responses to the common feature were also reinforced. Subsequent generalization tests revealed that on the positive display, both common and <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> produced decremental gradients, contradicting Farthing's (1971) statement that the common feature acquires a control function opposite that of the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature.</b> Procedural differences probably caused the discrepancy in results; within a display, Farthing presented common and <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> successively; the present study used simultaneous presentations of common and distinctive stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{groups of}} pigeons {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} between two stimulus displays that could be differentiated only by a single <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> {{on one of the}} displays. For half of the pigeons, responses to displays containing the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> were reinforced (feature-positive), and for the remaining pigeons responses to displays without the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> were reinforced (feature-negative). The pigeons were further grouped so that half were presented displays in which the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> was in close proximity to other features (compact displays) and half were presented displays in which the features were not close together (distributed displays). Pigeons in the feature-positive groups localized responses on the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of the displays and seldom responded to displays without the <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature.</b> Pigeons in the distributed feature-negative groups localized responses on features common to the two displays and did not learn the discrimination. Compacting the displays facilitated discrimination performance for the subjects in the feature-negative condition. Tests carried out in extinction indicated that responding in the compact feature-negative group was largely controlled by pattern rather than by the individual elements on the display...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} {{possible}} relationship among {{the awareness of}} one' s own speech disorder and {{some aspects of the}} phonological system, as the number and the type of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features,</b> as well as the interaction among the severity of the disorder and the non-specification of <b>distinctive</b> <b>features.</b> METHODS: The analyzed group has 23 children with diagnosis of speech disorder, aged 5 : 0 to 7 : 7. The speech data were analyzed through the <b>Distinctive</b> <b>Features</b> Analysis and classified by the Percentage of Correct Consonants. One also applied the Awareness of one' s own speech disorder test. The children were separated in two groups: with awareness of their own speech disorder established (more than 50 % of correct identification) and without awareness of their own speech disorder established (less than 50 % of correct identification). Finally, the variables of this research were submitted to analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The type of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> weren' t different between the groups, as well as the total of changed features and the severity disorder. However, a correlation between the severity disorder and the non-specification of <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> was verified, because the more severe disorders have more changes in these linguistic variables. CONCLUSION: The awareness of one' s own speech disorder doesn' t seem to be directly influenced by the type and by the number of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features,</b> neither by the speech disorder severity. Moreover, one verifies that the greater phonological disorder severity, the greater the number of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features...</b>|$|R
