5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E

25|$|Burns's worldly {{prospects}} {{were perhaps}} {{better than they}} had ever been; but he had become soured, and had alienated many of <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> by too freely expressing sympathy with the French Revolution and the then unpopular advocates of reform at home.

Feeling guility of having effectively sacked one of <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends,</b> he taught Lynott how to play bass, figuring {{it would be easier to}} learn than a six string guitar, and sold him a Fender Jazz Bass he had bought from Robert Ballagh for £36, and started giving him lessons.|$|E

Huston {{was reported to be}} easily bored during production, and admired Bogart (also bored easily off camera) not just for his acting talent but for his intense concentration on the set.|$|E
