Fathi said of Qandil [...] "He is the first man who has <b>fascinated</b> <b>me.</b> It {{is not easy to}} bewitch me, but he did. I feel like a student when I'm with him: I {{discover}} new qualities in him every day," [...] while Qandil said he felt an [...] "immediate chemical bond" [...] with Fathi.|$|E
500|$|A Manhattan {{power broker}} who is hired {{to act as}} a [...] "fixer" [...] in {{response}} to the bank heist. Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always <b>fascinated</b> <b>me,</b> and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, I never thought I would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South {{record of}} 88°23′. As they neared the pole, they looked for any {{break in the}} {{landscape}} that might indicate another expedition had got there ahead of them. While camped on 12 December they were momentarily alarmed by a black object that appeared on the horizon, but this proved to be their own dogs' droppings off in the distance, magnified by mirage. Next day they camped at 89°45′S, [...] from the pole. On the following day, 14December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled {{in front of the}} sledges, and at around 3pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole. They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau [...] "King Haakon VII's Plateau". Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: [...] "Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole—devil take it—had <b>fascinated</b> <b>me</b> since childhood, and now here I was at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?" ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003 Bullen made {{a journey}} to Perth's Small Screen Big Picture. On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested me is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what <b>fascinated</b> <b>me</b> is the way we arrive at the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
2500|$|Werfel {{does not}} mention here that he rewrote much of the novel in May 1933, {{responding}} to events in Nazi Germany and kept revising it up until it was published. Later, speaking to reporters, Werfel elaborated: [...] "The struggle of 5,000 people on Musa Dagh had so <b>fascinated</b> <b>me</b> that I wished to aid the Armenian people by writing about it and bringing it to the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the 12 November 2014 {{landing of}} the Philae lander on Comet 67P (part of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission), Vangelis {{composed}} three short pieces titled [...] "Arrival", [...] "Rosetta's Waltz", and [...] "Philae's Journey". The pieces were released online as videos accompanied by images and animations from the Rosetta mission. He was quoted by ESA as saying, [...] "Mythology, science and space exploration are subjects that have <b>fascinated</b> <b>me</b> since my early childhood. And {{they were always}} connected somehow with the music I write". In September 2016, the works were released {{as part of the}} new studio album Rosetta.|$|E

2500|$|While recovering, Day {{started to}} sing {{along with the}} radio and {{discovered}} a talent {{she did not know}} she had. Day said: [...] "During this long, boring period, I used to while away a lot of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller [...] But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to Ella Fitzgerald. There was a quality to her voice that <b>fascinated</b> <b>me,</b> and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Verdi had {{not lost}} sight of Corsaro at all, as is {{demonstrated}} in a letter he wrote to Piave. [...] Impatient because of the delays, Piave had asked for his libretto {{to be returned to}} him in order that he might fulfill another commitment. Verdi was shocked: [...] "Give you back Il corsaro, that Corsaro which has always <b>fascinated</b> <b>me</b> and which I've thought about so much, and which you've put into verse with more than your usual care?" [...] The composer continues to explain details of the work on the music he has already done, but notes [...] "I still have to write the opera for Lucca." [...] Piave relented, and he moved ahead on Macbeth 's libretto. But, {{by the end of the}} year, when Lucca and the British impresario, Benjamin Lumley were raising the issue of the London contract, Verdi replied that he found Il corsaro [...] "dull (freddo) and theatrically ineffective".|$|E
