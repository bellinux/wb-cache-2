It {{will focus on the}} benefits of process as it relates to personal creativity within a group and/or community. Composition borne of various musical traditions is often product driven, asking all students to create similar works as opposed to allowing them to individually decide what sounds good and what might not. Composition that begins with local soundscapes gives students the opportunity to listen creatively and decide what they would like to <b>include,</b> <b>exclude,</b> or change.

40|$|Please {{follow the}} link {{at the top}} of this item to view the full-textTertiary {{institutions}} represent pinnacles of authority in knowledge production, accreditation, legitimation and dissemination. Every year, millions of young adults aspire to ascend to these pinnacles and acquire their necessary credentials. What these institutions choose to <b>include,</b> <b>exclude,</b> or denigrate can make all the difference as to the cognitive and operational capacities of the products of this industry in a post training period. From this perspective, the reconstruction of knowledge, the critical scrutiny of existing paradigms and the epistemological foundations of existing academic practice, and identification of the limitations that they impose on creativity must precede any specific work on curricula, research, or teaching methods because it is there, up-stream at the levels of epistemological foundations, that the orientations that feed the curriculum and details of teaching-learning practices emanate. Students must be taught about the deeper technologies of subjugation that have been applied to keep their societies down so effectively, for so long, if they are to find a sustainable, inclusive formula for a way forwarSchool of Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Studies (SIRGS...|$|E
40|$|To {{commemorate the}} Dutch Revolt people {{from both the}} Northern and Southern Netherlands commissioned, kept, and {{collected}} a large variety of objects. From paintings to clay pipes, from hearth plates to gable stones, from clothing to cannonballs; all these objects were used to either remember of forget {{the war in the}} late sixteenth and seventeenth century. Especially on an urban level many of these material memories survive. They are part of an urban memory landscape, a set of shared memories which survived on several levels of the urban community and involved multiple stakeholders such as the magistrate, the church, corporations, and individual citizens. Within the urban community these stakeholders used diverse objects to promulgate a certain message about the Revolt. Subsequently this could become part of a city's urban identity and civic representation. Whether in the Dutch Republic or in the Habsburg Netherlands cities were well aware of their options either to <b>include,</b> <b>exclude</b> or reinterpret stories about the past. Material memories of the Dutch Revolt were therefore continuously and carefully (re) selected and used to reflect on what the urban community had gone through during eighty years of wa...|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{covering}} the perpetrators, victims and Sweden's society. The main issue {{is to examine}} how these categorization portrayed in the biggest newspaper in Sweden, Aftonbladet. To conduct the survey {{we have used a}} critical discourse analysis. The empirical material consists of 55 strategically selected news articles and 127 images related to the analyzed articles. In order to identify discourses we chose to use the following analytical concepts: We, they, <b>include,</b> <b>exclude,</b> ideal offender, ideal victim, the victims who survived and the ideal society to apply the investigation. With these concepts, we were able to identify five discourses and analyse how the perpetrators, victims, survivors and society were represented in the articles. In our conclousion, we found out that Sweden's society gets the largest space in the news texts. The representation of the perpetrator is depicted on the basis of different time aspects. In the first insight, the suspected perpetrator is presented as a father of four children who lived in Sweden to support his family, who remained in their homeland. In the second insight he is conceived as a stranger and a insane human.   As far as the victims are concerned, they are usually reflected as saints and they are rewarded by loveful words. ...|$|E
40|$|We re-investigate {{the market}} pricing of special items, with {{particular}} emphasis on how managers " frame " these non-operating earnings components via their inclusion or exclusion from " street " earnings, the earnings numbers that firms disclose in their press releases and that analysts track and forecast. When managers include the special items in " street earnings (i. e., " street " = GAAP), the market overprices them, believing the special items to be more persistent than they actually are. As a result, there is a negative relationship between the special items and future stock returns in the following year. However, when managers exclude special items from " street " earnings (i. e., " street " not equal GAAP), the market recognizes their transitory characteristic {{and the relationship between}} special items and returns is insignificant in the following year. We also demonstrate that the decision to <b>include</b> (<b>exclude)</b> special items with (from) " street " earnings is associated with whether inclusion or exclusion of special items a) increases earnings numbers, b) smoothes the earnings series, or c) helps managers to meet earnings benchmarks. These results suggest that the decision to include or exclude special items from " street " earnings is associated with managerial incentives to manage earnings numbers rather than signal the persistence of special items...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uncovers and {{analyses}} {{the relationship between}} forms of talk on British television between 1970 - 1990, and the uneven transformations in gender politics that occurred in this period, which encompasses both the second wave feminist movement {{and the rise of}} neoliberal politics. It presents five historical case studies of talk-based television programmes from across this time period: No Man’s Land (Associated Television/ITV, 1973), Good Afternoon! (Thames Television/ITV, 1971 - 1984), Pictures of Women: Sexuality (Channel 4, 1984), Watch the Woman (Channel 4, 1985), and Question Time (BBC One, 1979 -present). These case studies offer a deliberate selection of television texts that differ according to their institutional contexts; their position in the schedules; their status in existing broadcasting histories; their discursive arrangements; and their modes of address. The thesis seeks to consider how the communicative ethos of television talk has been gendered in three key ways: at the level of production - in the sense of when, how, and why television spaces have been opened up for gendered forms of talk in relationship to wider shifts in gender politics; {{at the level of the}} text - in terms of how the discursive arrangements of talk-based programmes have worked to <b>include,</b> <b>exclude,</b> legitimise or disavow women’s voices; and at the level of critical reception - in the sense of how television talk has been evaluated in profoundly gendered terms. The thesis is methodologically innovative because it theorises gendered forms of television talk in relationship to histories of television production, as well as to broader political, cultural and gender histories. It carries out important empirical ‘recovery work’ of hidden women’s television histories through the presentation of original archival research. It also presents theoretical work, which re-evaluates the distinctive communicative ethos of television – or its “sociability” in light of feminist theories of language, gender and power. Moreover, it sheds some historical light on why the institutional parameters of television still delimit the available spaces for women's speech...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained {{on a combination}} of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. MethodsTest collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of <b>included</b> and commonly <b>excluded</b> articles and one with a combination of <b>included</b> and <b>excluded</b> articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. ResultsThe AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with <b>included</b> and commonly <b>excluded</b> articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with <b>included</b> and <b>excluded</b> articles. ConclusionAutomatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of <b>included</b> and commonly <b>excluded</b> articles is more helpful than a combination of <b>included</b> and <b>excluded</b> articles...|$|R
40|$|The iFlow {{modelling}} {{framework is}} a width-averaged {{model for the}} systematic analysis of the water motion and sediment transport processes in estuaries and tidal rivers. The distinctive solution method, a mathematical perturbation method, used in the model allows for identification {{of the effect of}} individual physical processes on the water motion and sediment transport and study of the sensitivity of these processes to model parameters. This distinction between processes provides a unique tool for interpreting and explaining hydrodynamic interactions and sediment trapping. iFlow also includes a large number of options to configure the model geometry and multiple choices of turbulence and salinity models. Additionally, the model contains auxiliary components, including one that facilitates easy and fast sensitivity studies. iFlow has a modular structure, which makes it easy to <b>include,</b> <b>exclude</b> or change individual model components, called modules. Depending on the required functionality for the application at hand, modules can be selected to construct anything from very simple quasi-linear models to rather complex models involving multiple non-linear interactions. This way, the model complexity can be adjusted to the application. Once the modules containing the required functionality are selected, the underlying model structure automatically ensures modules are called in the correct order. The model inserts iteration loops over groups of modules that are mutually dependent. iFlow also ensures a smooth coupling of modules using analytical and numerical solution methods. This way the model combines the speed and accuracy of analytical solutions with the versatility of numerical solution methods. In this paper we present the modular structure, solution method and two examples of the use of iFlow. In the examples we present two case studies, of the Yangtze and Scheldt rivers, demonstrating how iFlow facilitates the analysis of model results, the understanding of the underlying physics and the testing of parameter sensitivity. A comparison of the model results to measurements shows a good qualitative agreement. iFlow is written in Python and is available as open source code under the LGPL license. </p...|$|E
40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} have shown increasing performance in image classification recent years. However, {{most of the}} methods developed in research are created, trained and compared on standard, general image collections. While some of such datasets contain realistic pictures with multiple objects and interaction between them, the selection of pictures and categories is broad and designed for the training of automatic classification systems. Therefore, questions remain on how modern image classification approaches {{can be applied to}} real-world datasets. What challenges can arise in the implementation of systems based on such datasets and how can they be solved? What level of classification performance can be expected? This study looks into these questions and gives insights on building such classification systems for real-world image collections. The Norwegian News Agency provided the author with a unique labeled dataset of one million images {{for the purpose of this}} research. The study consists of a trial and main experiment. The goal of the trial experiments was to learn necessary tools, test classification system implementation, training and testing pipelines as well as different architectural design choices. These set of experiments were performed on a subset of the original image collection with a limited number of categories. Insights from these experiments were further used to perform model training on a much broader set of manually selected categories. Two network architectures were employed and compared in the research: CaffeNet and GoogleNet. Results from the study suggest a big potential of using pre-trained convolutional {{neural networks}} in solving the task of multi-label image classification on a real-world dataset. However, the study also highlights a number of challenges connected with developing such system in a realistic environment, including: A unique set of categories which requires either to train a new model or to reuse a pre-trained neural network with adjustments in the architecture to solve classification problems. Difficulties in category tree transformation connected with the decision of which categories <b>include,</b> <b>exclude</b> and merge. Categories which are unsuitable for automatic training purposes including contextual, abstract and ambiguous labels. Contextual images which can not be classified only by visual features and require additional information. Issues connected with the classification of objects and people located in the background of the pictures. Duplicates of images in the dataset which can cause issues for both training and testing processes. The research gives further insights on the challenges mentioned, discusses their impact and possible solutions to them. The main limitation of the study is that only one dataset was employed in the research. Therefore, results are considered likely to be more generalizable to datasets similar to the one used in the study...|$|E
