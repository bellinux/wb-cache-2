50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete.</b> Compared with the other new stations Holden designed for the extension, Cockfosters' street buildings are modest in scale, lacking the mass of Oakwood or Arnos Grove or the avant-garde flourish of Southgate. Holden's early design sketches show the station with two towers. The most striking feature of the station is the tall concrete and glass train shed roof and platform canopies which are supported by portal frames of narrow blade-like concrete columns and beams rising from the platforms and spanning across the tracks. The trainshed roof constructed at Uxbridge in 1937-38 was built to a similar design. Cockfosters station is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

The octagonal ticket hall is lit by four large windows with an imposing lattice of concrete beams in the ceiling; large London Underground roundels; and original bronze signs, ventilation grilles and information panel frames. The sub-surface areas of the station are finished in biscuit-coloured tiles lined with red friezes.

[...] The Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton at the Great Exhibition of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal curtain wall. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago, built in 1884 by William Le Baron Jenney. [...] The iron frame construction of the Eiffel Tower, then the tallest structure in the world, captured the imagination of millions of visitors to the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Modern civil {{engineering}} {{is characterized by}} resource and energy efficiency, and func-tional integration. The focus of modern architecture is therefore increasingly on free-formed build-ings with organic shapes and biomorphic structures. The basis of new buildings still consists of conventional materials like steel, <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete.</b> However, the applicability of these materials is limited, regarding lightweight design, freedom of design, efficiency and functional inte-gration. Innovative projects either cannot be implemented, or would be put to enormous costs and expenditure of resources. The theoretical and experimental basis for this functionally integrated support structure was es-tablished {{within the scope of}} the research project “New lightweight structural components and pro-cessing technologies for the application in support structures”, supported by the Sächsische Aufbau-bank SAB. The main objective was to develop a modular supporting structure in a constructive way that considers lightweight criteria and material. Innovative production technologies were used for the implementation. New approaches included the application of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) due to its favorable mechanical properties, low susceptibility to corrosion and load-adjusted dimen...|$|E

The K 10 cutting tools were coated with monolayer titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), multilayer TiAlN/titanium silicon nitride (TiSiN), and TiAlN/titanium boron oxide nitride (TiBON). Cutting tests {{were performed on}} computer numeric control router at a high cutting speed of 17 m/s and a feed rate of 0. 2 mm/rev to investigate the wear characteristics on the clearance face of these coated tools. Experimental {{results show that the}} coated tools experienced a smaller amount of clearance wear than the uncoated tool in cutting the mersawa wood, fiberboard, particleboard, and GRC. The GRC compared to the other work materials caused higher amount of clearance wear for both the uncoated and coated cutting tools. High content of silica and density were the reason for this phenomenon. The best coating among other coated cutting tools in this study was multilayer TiAlN/TiBON. The high hardness, low coefficient of friction, high resistance to oxidation, and high resistance to delamination wear of the multilayer-coated TiAlN/TiBON tool indicate a very promising applicability of this coating for high-speed cutting of abrasive woods and wood-based materials...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer materials (composite FRP materials) to strengthen existing concrete structures {{continues to expand}} as our current infrastructure ages. However, {{one of the concerns}} when using FRP systems in this manner is the difficulty in determining the quality and strength of the bond between the concrete and FRP overlays. There appears to be a need for a reliable non-destructive testing (NDT) method that can directly determine the strength of this bond to ensure the structural performance of FRP-strengthened concrete systems. The goal of this research was to evaluate whether a non-destructive acoustoultrasonic parameters (AUP) evaluation method could be used to determine the shear strength of the bond between FRP systems and concrete substrates. Eighteen concrete beams were externally reinforced flexurally with carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymers (CFRP) <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> fiber <b>reinforced</b> polymers (GFRP) <b>and</b> then non-destructively tested using the AUP procedures. The test beam specimens were then placed in a simply supported configuration and loaded to failure.

Both longitudinal and shear transducers were utilized to collect propagating stress waves; however, only the longitudinal transducer provided consistent correlations to interfacial shear strength values. The investigation concluded that the (AUP) analysis procedure can be used to determine the interfacial shear bond strength of both <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> carbon fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam specimens with relatively good correlation to actual strength data...|$|R
