5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a <b>gauge</b> <b>theory</b> similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of various types of equivalences in large N <b>gauge</b> <b>theories.</b> We are {{specifically}} interested in theories whose dynamics is not constrained by supersymmetry or conformal invariance, and we consider theories both at zero and at finite temperature. Specific examples include equivalences between <b>gauge</b> <b>theories,</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> and matrix models, and between <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> and gravitational theories. The use of lattice regularization for zero temperature <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> and effective hydrodynamic description for finite temperature <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> made it possible to find generic equivalences which do not rely on any sort of small-parameter expansion...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the string tensions, mass spectrum, and deconfining temperatures of SO(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> in 2 + 1 dimensions. After {{a review of}} lattice field theory, we describe how we simulate the corresponding lattice <b>gauge</b> <b>theories,</b> construct operators to project on to specific states, and extrapolate values to the continuum limit. We discuss how to avoid possible complications such as finite size corrections and the bulk transition. SO(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> have become recently topical since {{they do not have}} a fermion sign problem, are orbifold equivalent to SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories,</b> and share a common large- N limit in their common sector of states with SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories.</b> This motivates us to compare the physical properties of SO(N) and SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> between 'group equivalences', which includes Lie algebra equivalences such as SO (6) and SU (4), and particularly a large- N equivalence. We discuss the large- N orbifold equivalence between SO(N) and SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories,</b> which relates the large- N <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> perturbatively. Using large- N extrapolations at fixed 't Hooft coupling, we test to see if SO(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> and SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> share non-perturbative properties at the large- N limit. If these group equivalences lead to similar physics in the <b>gauge</b> <b>theories,</b> then we could imagine doing finite chemical potential calculations that are currently intractable in SU(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories</b> by calculating equivalent quantities in the corresponding SO(N) <b>gauge</b> <b>theories.</b> We show that the SO(N) and SU(N) values match between group equivalences and at the large- N limit.

5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important <b>gauge</b> <b>theory</b> in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called 3D mirror symmetry which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of <b>gauge</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
