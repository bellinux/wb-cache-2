5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, <b>enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization,</b> and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature {{of some of the}} properties of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an <b>enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization</b> (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} the lowest temperature possible, {{but it is not the}} lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the <b>enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization</b> (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero.

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its <b>enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization.</b> In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
25|$|When a {{substance}} undergoes a phase transition (changes from one {{state of matter}} to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See <b>Enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization.</b> The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the enthalpy of fusion and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the enthalpy of sublimation.|$|E

2500|$|High ethanol blends {{present a}} problem to achieve enough vapor {{pressure}} for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather (since ethanol tends to increase fuel <b>enthalpy</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization).</b> When vapor pressure is below 45 kPa starting a cold engine becomes difficult.

40|$|International audienceA {{classical}} {{force field}} is {{proposed for the}} molecular simulation of primary alkanolamines containing a NH 2 C C OH backbone. A method is devised {{to take into account}} the polar (Hbonding) environment of the alkanolamines by calculating electrostatic charges in the presence of explicit solvent molecules. The force field does not use a universal set of charges, but is rather constructed by following a general method for obtaining specific charges for the different alkanolamines. The model is parameterized on the two simplest primary alkanolamines and then validated by calculating thermodynamic properties of five other molecules. Experimental liquid densities and <b>enthalpies</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization</b> are also reported in order to complete existing literature data. The predicted ability of the force field is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with experimental densities and <b>enthalpies</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization.</b> Densities are predicted with an uncertainty of 1. 5 % and <b>enthalpies</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaporization</b> with an uncertainty of 1 kJmol 1. A decomposition of the interaction energy into electrostatic and repulsive- dispersive interactions and an analysis of hydrogenbond statistics lead to a complex picture.
