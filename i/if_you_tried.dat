2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E

To wield the long sword well, you must wield it calmly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to wield it quickly, like a folding fan or a short sword, you will err by using [...] "short sword chopping". You cannot cut down {{a man with}} a long sword using this method.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why not? You {{are much}} sharper than most people, and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried,</b> {{you would know}} those things much better than I do, as {{you know how to}} learn history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is surely}} some mistake here, gentlemen," [...] {{he said in}} an unctuous, make-everything-easy voice. [...] "I fancy that you have been misdirected. Possibly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> farther down the street--" ...|$|E
