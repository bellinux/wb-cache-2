5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E
5|$|The crisis worsened and by December 19, 2001, {{riots and}} looting broke out at several {{points in the}} country. De la Rúa {{announced}} in a cadena nacional (national network broadcast) that he established a state of emergency. The riots continued; <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> followed by increased protests, the cacerolazos, which caused 27 deaths and thousands of injuries. Cavallo resigned at midnight the same day, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, events held at Speakers' Corner {{must not}} deal with any matter that relates {{directly}} or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which may cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore. On 19 September 2008, Thamiselvan Karuppaya, an Indian real estate agent who wished to speak at Speakers' Corner {{about the use of}} Tamil on public signs, had to change his plans after being informed by the police that he required a permit as the topic of <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> racially sensitive.

5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened more violence if their demands were not met. Ralston addressed {{the crowd to}} promise concessions if the workers would return to work. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's tenement slums.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} dismissal, Wenger {{travelled}} to the United Arab Emirates {{to attend a}} series of conferences held by FIFA. Wenger {{was a member of}} the football governing body's technical committee, responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to coaches of emerging football nations. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> closely followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into the restructuring of its football league system. Representatives of Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger and offered him the chance to become the club's manager. Wenger deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him; negotiations between the two parties lasted for two months. In that time, he sought the advice of his closest friends and family, and flew to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final appearance before his professional retirement. In December 1994, Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year contract worth ¥75m annually.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> {{credited}} in {{part with}} preventing post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis, on a night where such events broke out in major cities across the country. It is widely {{considered one of the}} greatest speeches in American history.|$|E

25|$|<b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> effective. The state {{government}} purchased the theatre for £12,000 {{with the promise}} of restoration if matching funds were raised. An ambitious public campaign followed and by 1952, the renovations were completed. 'Royal boxes' had been installed specifically for an anticipated visit from then-Princess Elizabeth. King George's death curtailed the planned audience but the theatre re-opened on schedule. The updates were a success; the theatre was booked with frequent productions and became home to a new resident company.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George {{afterwards}} told Amery that in 50 years, he {{had heard}} few speeches that matched his in sustained power and none with so dramatic a climax. The debate led to 42 Conservative Members of Parliament voting against Chamberlain and 36 abstaining, leading to {{the downfall of the}} Conservative government and the formation of a national government under Churchill's premiership. Amery himself noted in his diary that he believed that <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> one of his best received in the House and that he had made a difference to the outcome of the debate.|$|E

25|$|Six months later, he {{was arrested}} and {{expelled}} from the German Empire for maintaining close contacts with the Russian revolutionaries there. He finished his education in 1894–1896 in Zürich, Nancy and Montpellier, where he wrote for La Jeunesse Socialiste and La Petite République, maintaining a friendship with Guesde and becoming an opponent of Jean Jaurès' reformist views. According to his own testimony, he became active in supporting the Anti-Ottoman upsurge in Crete and Macedonia, as well as Dashnak revolutionary activities. In 1896, he was the Bulgarian representative to the Second International's London Congress (part of <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> published in Karl Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit).|$|E
25|$|On 25 August, Giorgi Karkarashvili, the Georgian {{military}} commander, announced via {{television that}} the Georgian forces {{would not take}} any POWs. He promised that no harm would be done to peaceful residents of Abkhazia and that peace talks would be conducted. He warned separatists that if the peace talks wouldn't succeed and if 100,000 Georgians were killed, that the remaining 97,000 ethnic Abkhaz, who supported Ardzinba would perish. Karkarashvili later allegedly threatened the Abkhaz politician, Vladislav Ardzinba, not to take any actions that would leave the Abkhaz nation without descendants and thus placed the responsibility for future deaths on Ardzinba personally. Later, <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> used by the separatists as propaganda and to justify their own actions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supporters}} {{raised concerns}} that publications such as The New York Times minimized {{coverage of the}} Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates', especially Trump's and Clinton's. A December 2015 report found that the three major networksCBS, NBC, and ABChad spent 234minutes reporting on Trump and 10minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that ABC World News Tonight had spent 81minutes on Trump and less than 1minute on Sanders during 2015. In November 2016, journalist Amy Goodman noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger {{than any of the}} others, but <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> not mentioned, let alone broadcast.|$|E

25|$|Kamenev {{continued}} to oppose Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, resulting in his expulsion from the Central Committee in October 1927. After {{the expulsion of}} Zinoviev and Trotsky from the Communist Party on 12 November 1927, Kamenev was the United Opposition's chief spokesman within the Party, representing its position at the XVth Party Congress in December 1927. Kamenev used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation among the groups. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> interrupted 24 times by his opponents - Bukharin, Ryutin, and Kaganovich, {{making it clear that}} Kamenev's attempts were futile. The Congress declared United Opposition views incompatible with Communist Party membership; it expelled Kamenev and dozens of leading Oppositionists from the Party. This paved the way for mass expulsions in 1928 of rank-and-file Oppositionists, as well as sending prominent Left Oppositionists into internal exile.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A. Wallace's {{bid for the}} President of the United States, {{during which}} Robeson {{traveled}} to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him. In the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas to work because his concert performances were canceled at the FBI's behest. While on tour, he spoke at the World Peace Council, at which <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> publicly reported as equating America with a Fascist state—a depiction that he flatly denied. Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to him was a catalyst for his becoming an enemy of mainstream America. Robeson refused to bow to public criticism when he advocated in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin J. Davis Jr., charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.|$|E
25|$|Hawking's {{first year}} as a {{doctoral}} student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find {{that he had been}} assigned Dennis William Sciama, {{one of the founders of}} modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depressionthough his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point. However, his disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> <b>was</b> almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work. Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.|$|E
