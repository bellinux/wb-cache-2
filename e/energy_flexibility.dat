50|$|The {{core of the}} EF-Pi is the <b>Energy</b> <b>Flexibility</b> Interface (EFI). The EFI is {{a generic}} interfacewhich {{appliance}} manufacturers can use to describe <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility,</b> and which Smart Gridservice developers can use to describe {{how they want to}} use this flexibility. The EFIeffectively provides a common language for both sides, facilitating interoperability betweenall Smart Grid services and smart appliances.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Flexibility</b> Platform and Interface (EF-Pi) {{approach}} is to decoupleSmart Grid services from the customer appliances.|$|E

50|$|All {{candidates}} for rhizotomy must have good muscle {{strength in the}} legs and trunk. There must also be evidence of adequate motor control, {{or the ability to}} make reciprocal movements for crawling or walking, and to move reasonably quickly from one posture to another. Chiefly, pediatric rhizotomy candidates are people with CP who have shown age-appropriate progression in motor development, but spasticity hampers the development of skills and/or causes gait patterns like the scissors gait. In adults, the primary requirements are that the person is able to ambulate independently, but spasticity limits <b>energy,</b> <b>flexibility,</b> walking speed and balance and sometimes causes pain/muscle spasms.|$|E

But her jumps, explosive <b>energy,</b> <b>flexibility</b> and coordination were very good then, {{and it is very}} rare that you get all these qualities in one athlete, particularly at that age." [...] He is confident that You has what it takes to become a future world and Olympic champion.

50|$|Recent {{research}} {{has shifted from}} focusing solely on distal (dispositional/trait-like) characteristics of leaders to more proximal (malleable/state-like) individual differences often {{in the form of}} knowledge and skills (Hoffman et al., 2011). The hope is that emergence of proximal traits in trait leadership theory will help researchers answer the ancient question: are leaders born or made? Proximal individual differences suggest that the characteristics that distinguish effective leaders from non-effective leaders are not necessarily stable through the life-span, implying that these traits may be able to be developed. Hoffman and others (2011) examined the effects of distal vs. proximal traits on leader effectiveness. He found that distal individual differences of achievement motivation, <b>energy,</b> <b>flexibility,</b> dominance, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, creativity, and charisma were strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. Additionally, he found that the proximal individual differences of interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication, management skills, problem solving skills, and decision making were also strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. His results suggested that on average, distal and proximal individual differences have a similar relationship with effective leadership (Hoffman et al., 2011).|$|E

40|$|Conventional key {{performance}} indicators (KPI) assessed in building simulation lack specific measures of how the building interacts with the grid and its <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility.</b> This paper aims to {{provide an overview of}} specific <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> {{performance indicators}}, together with supporting control strategies. If applied correctly, the indicators help improving the building performance in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> and can enable minimization of operational energy costs. Price-based load shifting, self-generation and self-consumption are among the most commonly used performance indicators that quantify <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> and grid interaction. It has been found that the majority of performance indicators, specific to <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility,</b> are combined with rule-based control. Only a limited amount of specific <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> KPIs are used in combination with optimal control or model predictive control. Both of these advanced control approaches often have a couple of economic or comfort objectives that do not take into account an <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> KPI. There is evidence that recent model predictive control approaches incorporate some aspects of building <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> to minimize operational cost in conjunction with time varying pricing...|$|E

30|$|Building {{managers}} {{believe that}} buildings can provide <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> by building automation and distributed energy resources. However, the main task for buildings is still energy efficiency {{due to the}} national and international policies on energy efficiency and monetary benefit from the energy saving. The main barriers for buildings to provide <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> are 1) building refurbishment is needed in many buildings, 2) the monetary benefit of providing <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> to the grid is not significant, 3) building management systems need to be upgraded and respond properly to activities in rooms and demand from the grid.|$|E
30|$|Building {{automation}} {{enables the}} possibility of <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> in buildings. To investigate the motivation and barriers for the <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> in buildings, this study develops a conceptual framework of the readiness for energy flexible buildings by conducting interviews with building automation suppliers, electricity supplier, district heating supplier, distribution system operator, energy service companies, experts in energy and buildings, building managers, and occupants. The two main parts of the framework are building preparation, grid and market conditions following the impacts of regulation and policies, stakeholder collaboration and integrated building automation. A case study of campus buildings is conducted to demonstrate the framework. The result of the case study shows that the main barriers for buildings to provide <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> are 1) many buildings are too old {{and need to be}} refurbished, 2) the benefit of providing <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> to the grid is not sufficient, 3) building management systems need to be either installed or upgraded to response to the demand from the grid. Building managers believe that buildings can provide <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> by building automation and distributed energy resources, but they consider energy efficiency to be more important than providing flexibility to the grid. Meanwhile, occupants have different opinions regarding the comfort level of indoor air quality and control, and the differences are based on various factors, e.g. location, room type, and building ages.|$|E
30|$|However, {{the case}} study with campus {{buildings}} shows {{that none of the}} three aspects are ready in the current situation in Denmark. The <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> market is not ready and there is no incentive for buildings to provide <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility.</b> For example, the requirement for participating ancillary service in Denmark is 1 MV that most of the commercial buildings cannot participate in this market directly. Meanwhile, aggregators aggregating consumption side <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> are not allowed to participate in the Danish energy market. There is usually a fixed electricity price for the commercial buildings in Denmark that is based on negotiation with energy suppliers. Although buildings can choose hourly electricity price, the energy bill is not significantly different from the fixed price.|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews {{different}} approaches, technologies, {{and strategies}} to manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as {{solar and wind}} power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting <b>energy</b> system <b>flexibility</b> measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e. g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different “P 2 Y”-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e. g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To “functionalize” or to assess {{the value of the}} various <b>energy</b> system <b>flexibility</b> measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Future CCS power plants are usually equipped with more components than conventional power plants, {{resulting in}} a more complex and inert reaction on changes in power output. Additionally, due to the change in price structures and higher fixed and operational costs for CCS power plants, it is harder for them to be economically efficient. This study will show different options to increase the flexibility of CCS power plants and evaluate their benefits...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{definitions}} and indicators for <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> of buildings are reviewed and evaluated {{in the context}} of nearly zero energy buildings, energy matching and grid interactions. The thesis approaches <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> of buildings from the building perspective. Focus is set on the evaluation of the flexibility a building system can achieve. Objective of the thesis is to treat the whole building system rather than to focus on single parts of it. Available definitions for <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> of a building are reviewed and a comprehensive definition is framed: “The ability of a building system to change its energy or power characteristics for a certain time period without influencing the designated utilization of the building. ” The goal is to collect available flexibility, matching and grid interaction indicators, to categorize and evaluate them and to propose possible developments. Recent research shows that energy matching and grid interaction are not congruent with <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Nevertheless the three topics still correlate, as <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> is a suitable tool on the path towards energy matching. Energy matching is not only the goal for the building system itself, but the whole energy market needs matching of demand and generation to achieve highest efficiency. The most suitable indicators are undergoing further investigation. Differences in important parts of the simulation like the reviewed period, the price signal or the demand influence the performance of the indicators and may foil their original meaning. The selected indicators are evaluated based on a TRNSYS simulation of a single family house in Helsinki, Finland. All indicators are calculated based on the same simulation consisting of 18 cases to evaluate their adaptability for a general assessment of <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> of buildings...|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} question is what the <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> in buildings is supposed to accomplish: is it everyday flexibility or in case of emergency. It could become much cheaper to utilize flexible consumption instead of having large production facilities on standby in case of emergency. In the near future, data centers are being built in Denmark, which will not use flexible consumption and therefore becomes a baseload. This will likely create an incentive for <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> in buildings.|$|E

30|$|Renewable energy {{technologies}} are rapidly becoming {{a significant part}} of the global energy system. Policies to support renewable energy deployment have been widely established for power generation, heating, cooling, and transportation. The primary motivations for these policies have been climate change mitigation, energy security, <b>energy</b> system <b>flexibility,</b> <b>energy</b> system resiliency and economic development. In fact, by the end of 2015 renewable energy support policies had been implemented in more than 146 countries [1]. However, as renewable {{energy technologies}} have become increasingly cost-competitive and more widely deployed, policymakers have begun to focus their attention on the adaption of existing policies to reflect the rapidly changing economics of these technologies and the impacts they have may have on the energy systems in which they are deployed. Recent trends in renewable energy policy include integration of policy mechanisms, linkage between electricity, heating/cooling, and transport sector policies and the development of new mechanisms to integrate increasing amounts of renewable energy into energy systems. Importantly, however, appropriate renewable energy policies are context specific and, therefore, must be considered within the unique circumstances of the regional, national or sub-national energy systems in which they are to be applied.|$|R
30|$|In this context, {{the active}} {{involvement}} of end users (e.g. as prosumers) and {{the exploitation of}} end user flexibility can {{pave the way for}} the creation of local energy balances on a decentralized level (Mengelkamp et al. 2018 a; Kamrat 2001). Locally balanced distribution systems lead to a more balanced energy transmission system. This can result in lower transmission congestion and, consequently, reduce the need for redispatch measures and RES curtailment in an energy system. Facilitating a market approach, local energy markets (LEMs) may enable the cost-efficient creation of local energy balances between energy producers, prosumers and consumers. On such LEMs, the participants can trade <b>energy</b> and <b>flexibility</b> among each other.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{structural}} thermal storage is often suggested {{as a key}} technology to improve the penetration of renewable energy sources and mitigate potential production and distribution capacity issues. Therefore, a quantitative assessment of the <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> provided by structural thermal energy storage is a prerequisite to instigate a large scale deployment of thermal mass as active storage technologies in an active demand response (ADR) context. In {{the first part of}} the work, a generic, simulation-based and dynamic quantification method is presented for the characterization of the ADR potential, or <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility,</b> {{of structural}} thermal energy storage. The quantification method is based on three ADR characteristics – i. e. available storage capacity, storage efficiency and power-shifting capability – which can be used to quantify the ADR potential in both design and operation. In the second part of the work, the methodology is applied to quantify the ADR characteristics for the structural thermal energy storage capacity for the different typologies of the Belgian residential building stock. Thereby an in-depth analysis demonstrates the relation between the building properties and its <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> as well as the dependence of the <b>energy</b> <b>flexibility</b> on the dynamic boundary conditions. status: publishe...|$|E

Nowadays, to participate in the electricity regulating market in Denmark, the requirement is a minimum electricity supply of 10  MW, which is much higher than an individual building can provide.|$|E
