25|$|In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited {{before the}} battle {{by an old}} man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would {{intervene}} in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) {{the sign of the cross}} and Jesus Christ on a crucifix.

25|$|On 1 April 1911, Porfirio Díaz {{claimed that}} he had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> {{of the people of}} Mexico, {{replaced}} his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President Díaz and Vice-President Ramón Corral. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders– they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with Díaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries Pascual Orozco and Francisco Villa disagreed and went ahead with an attack on Ciudad Juárez. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively and on 21 May 1911, the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez was signed.|$|E
25|$|Inside the fortress, {{they prepare}} for battle. Soon, Saruman's army of 10,000 Uruk-hai arrive. They breach the outer walls using {{explosives}} and overwhelm the inner defenses. As Berethor fights, he suddenly hears {{the voice of}} Saruman telling him he shall be punished for his betrayal. Gandalf and Éomer arrive with the Rohirrim, attacking and decimating the Uruk-hai army. Meanwhile, the Ents, roused to war by Saruman's partial destruction of Fangorn Forest, lay siege to Orthanc, ending Saruman's involvement in the war. Gandalf then explains to Berethor why he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Saruman - Berethor was captured by Saruman, who put him under a spell. Saruman believed Boromir would take the Ring from Frodo, and Berethor's job was to take it from Boromir {{and return it to}} Saruman. However, Boromir did not take the Ring. Knowing of Saruman's plan, Gandalf and Galadriel sent Idrial to find Berethor and stay by him until the spell could be broken, and with the destruction of Orthanc, Berethor is freed from the spell.|$|E
500|$|... "Kitsunegari" [...] {{serves as}} a sequel to the third season episode [...] "Pusher". The episode's title means [...] "Fox hunt" [...] in Japanese. Minear's {{original}} story for the episode was one where a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist would have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man. Series creator Frank Spotnitz suggested that Minear should use fan favorite Robert Modell.|$|E

500|$|Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the {{south-west}} of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded {{meeting of}} white people in South Africa up to that time. [...] "I stand here before you", Kruger declared, [...] "called by the people. In {{the voice of the}} people I have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!" [...] He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the Vice-President of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|Jin Kobayashi {{began writing}} School Rumble, his debut work, in 2002. He stated to an {{audience}} at Honolulu's 2006 Kawaii Kon convention that he started writing the series because he found {{the idea of a}} manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting. Kobayashi's favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates [...] "about 30%" [...] of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that Ryuuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical. Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates; Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> actors' interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound. He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes [...] "if there's no misunderstanding then there's no funny story." [...] He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.|$|E

2500|$|In 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon {{wrote an}} account {{in which they}} both claimed to have seen the resurrected Jesus Christ.

The two passages each describe the experience of Paul's traveling companions during the revelation, with Acts 9:7 (the author's description of the event) stating that Paul's traveling companions <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> that spoke to him; and Acts 22:9 (the author's quotation of Paul's own words) traditionally stating they did not.|$|E
