"An <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> <b>H5</b> {{virus was}} present in {{multiple}} organs in all species from the outbreak site in Grd Jotyar (Table). cDNA for sequencing was amplified directly from RNA extracts from pathologic materials without virus isolation. On the basis of sequence analysis of the full HA1 gene and 219 amino acids of the HA2 gene, the viruses from the goose and 1 cat from Grd Jotyar and from the person who died from Sarcapcarn (sequence derived from PCR amplification from first-passage egg material) are >99% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (GenBank nos. DQ435200-02). Thus, no indication of virus adaptation to cats was found. The viruses from Iraq are most closely related to currently circulating Qinghai-like viruses, but when compared with A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005 (H5N1) (GenBank no. DQ095622), they share only 97.4% identity at the nucleic acid level with 3 amino acid substitutions of unknown significance. On the other hand, the virus from the cat is only 93.4% identical to A/tiger/Thailand/CU-T4/2004(H5N1) (GenBank no. AY972539). These results are not surprising, given that these strains are representative of different clades (8,9). Sequencing of 1,349 bp of the N gene from cat 1 and the goose (to be submitted to GenBank) show identity at the amino acid level, and that the N genes of viruses infecting the cat and goose are >99% identical to that of A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005(H5N1). These findings {{support the notion that}} cats may be broadly susceptible to circulating H5N1 viruses and thus {{may play a role in}} reassortment, antigenic drift, and transmission." ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the CombiMatrix influenza detection system compared to the FDA approved Luminex Respiratory virus panel (RVP) assay for <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> subtyping. Verification of the CombiMatrix influenza detection system was carried out using the Luminex RVP assay as a reference method. A limit of detection (LOD) series was performed using the Luminex and CombiMatrix systems with both <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 viruses. Seventy-five clinical specimens were used in the study. Of these, 16 were <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 3 N 2) positive and five were <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 1 N 1) positive. Fifty-four specimens were <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> negative or "no call" (inconclusive) or could not be subtyped. The LOD of the Luminex RVP assay was found to be 0. 3 TCID 50 s/mL for <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 3 N 2) and 16 TCID 50 s/mL for <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 1 N 1).

40|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>A</b> {{virus is}} a dreadful {{pathogen}} {{of animals and}} humans, causing widespread infection and severe morbidity and mortality. It is essential to characterize the <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus-host interaction and develop efficient counter measures against the viral infection. Autophagy {{is known as a}} catabolic process for the recycling of the cytoplasmic macromolecules. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} autophagy is a critical mechanism underlying the interaction between <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus and its host.

On the other hand, <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus can inhibit the autophagic formation via interaction with the autophagy-related genes (Atg) and signaling pathways. In addition, autophagy is involved in the influenza virus-regulated cell deaths, leading to significant changes in host apoptosis. Interestingly, the high pathogenic strains of <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus, such as H 5 N 1, stimulate autophagic cell death and appear to interplay with the autophagy in distinct ways as compared with low pathogenic strains.

40|$|The homeostatic {{mechanisms}} that regulate {{the maintenance of}} immunological memory to the multiple pathogen encounters over time are unknown.

Our aim was to determine the seroprevalence and seroincidence of novel <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> infection among HIV-infected patients in Taiwan. MethodsBetween September and November 2009, before the implementation of a nationwide vaccination for novel <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> in Taiwan, 931 HIV-infected patients and 566 persons seeking voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV infection at our university hospital were enrolled in this study.

ResultsHIV-infected patients had a significantly lower seroprevalence of novel <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> infection than VCT clients (14. 7 % vs. 33. 9 %, p¬†<¬† 0. 001). The seroincidence of novel <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> infection among HIV-infected patients was 9. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7. 6 ‚Äì 11. 4).

In the lower respiratory tract of squirrel monkeys, this avian-human influenza reassortant virus, like its avian <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> parent virus, was restricted approximately 100 -fold in replication compared with the wild-type human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus. Despite this restriction of replication, infection of monkeys with the avian-human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> reassortant virus induced resistance to wild-type human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus challenge. In comparison with the wild-type human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus, the avian-human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> reassortant was also fully attenuated when 10 (5. 5) to 10 (7. 5) 50 % tissue culture infective doses were administered to susceptible adult volunteers.

Here, we show that the M 158 - 66 epitope in the M 1 protein derived from human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus was poorly recognized compared to the M 1 protein derived from avian <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that naturally occurring variations at extraepitopic amino acid residues affect CD 8 + T cell recognition of the M 158 - 66 epitope. These data indicate that human <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses can impair recognition by M 158 - 66 -specific CTLs while retaining the conserved amino acid sequence of the epitope, which may represent a yet-unknown immune evasion strategy for <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses. This difference in recognition may have implications for the viral replication kinetics in HLA-A* 0201 individuals and spread of <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses in the human population. The findings may aid the rational design of universal influenza vaccines that aim at the induction of cross-reactive virus-specific CTL responses...|$|R
40|$|We studied anti-influenza {{cytotoxicity}} by bulk {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear leukocyte (PBL) cultures derived from older, chronically ill volunteers undergoing vaccination. Vaccinees received either cold-recombinant, live-attenuated influenza A/Korea/ 1 / 82 (H 3 N 2) virus intranasally or inactivated monovalent influenza A/Taiwan/ 1 / 86 (H 1 N 1) subvirion vaccine intramuscularly. PBL were collected pre- and postvaccination and in vitro stimulated by autologous PBL infected with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus homologous and heterosubtypic to the respective vaccine strain. Cytotoxicity was measured against <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus-infected autologous and {{human leukocyte antigen}} (HLA) -mismatched PBL targets infected with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus homologous or heterosubtypic to the vaccine virus strain. Vaccinees infected with the live-attenuated virus developed significant rises in mean anti-influenza, HLA-restricted cytotoxicity that was cross-reactive against <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses homologous and heterosubtypic to the vaccine virus. The enhanced cross-reactive cytotoxicity was inducible postvaccination by in vitro stimulation with autologous PBL infected with the homologous <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 3 N 2) virus and with <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 1 N 1) virus. In contrast, after vaccination with inactivated monovalent subvirion vaccine, volunteers developed significant increases in mean anti-influenza, HLA-restricted cytotoxicity only against autologous PBL infected with homologous <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 1 N 1) virus. Increased cytotoxicity occurred only after in vitro stimulation with autologous cells infected with homologous <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> (H 1 N 1) virus. Mean gamma interferon levels in supernatant fluids of <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus-stimulated effector PBL did not increase postvaccination, despite increased levels of anti-influenza cytotoxicity displayed by the effector cells. We conclude that the live-attenuated <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus infection induced {{a broader range of}} enhanced anti-influenza cytotoxicity than did the inactivated subvirion vaccine...|$|R

40|$|The <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> {{virus is}} one of the leading causes of {{respiratory}} tract infections in humans. Upon infection with <b>an</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> virus, both innate and adaptive immune responses are induced. Here we discuss various strategies used by <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> viruses to evade innate immune responses and recognition by components of the humoral and cellular immune response, which consequently may result in reduced clearing of the virus and virus-infected cells. Finally, we discuss how the current knowledge about immune evasion can be used to improve <b>influenza</b> <b>A</b> vaccination strategies...|$|R
