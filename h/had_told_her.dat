However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger.

5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E
5|$|Veitch {{worked as}} a {{stripper}} for {{four years in the}} Las Vegas area and California. After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle. She then became a Christian, married her boyfriend Jon, started and completed a course in cosmetology, left the sex industry, and became a hairdresser all by September 1999. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished she <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E
5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E

5|$|Mello invades SPK—an {{organization}} {{that aims to}} catch Kira—to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules, which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light. Mello then enlists {{the help of his}} friend Matt to spy on Misa Amane, suspecting she is helping Kira. After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap Kiyomi Takada, Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity. Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> his name and what to do in such a situation. Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; Teru Mikami uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.|$|E

At the time of her disappearance, she was staying at a motel in Hauppauge, New York, 15 miles northeast of Gilgo Beach. Her body was also recovered in December 2010.|$|E
25|$|For his part, Joseph Zoellner {{rather more}} prosaically {{stated that he}} {{and the rest of the}} quartet felt they had been playing to a “responsive instrument” and were {{impressed}} with Keller’s ability to interpret the music. For instance, although no one <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the Tchaikovsky work supposedly had its basis in an old fisherman’s song, Keller described it as evoking the sea and the ocean breeze on her face.|$|E

25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly {{that she}} wanted to go and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1995, {{an eight-year-old}} girl was {{abducted}} and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley.

The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> he had a knife in his possession.|$|E
25|$|In a {{biography}} published in 2011, William M. Adler concludes that Hill was probably innocent of murder, but {{also suggests that}} Hill came to see himself as worth more to the labor movement as a dead martyr than he was alive, and that this understanding may have influenced his decisions not to testify at the trial and subsequently to spurn all chances of a pardon. Adler reports that evidence pointed to early police suspect Frank Z. Wilson, and cites Hilda Erickson's letter, which states that Hill <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{he had been shot}} by her former fiance.|$|E
