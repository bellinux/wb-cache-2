25|$|HMQS Gayundah was a flat-iron gunboat {{operated}} by the Queensland Maritime Defence Force and later the Royal Australian Navy (as HMAS Gayundah). She entered service in 1884 and was decommissioned and sold to a civilian company in 1921. She then served as sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>barge</b> in Brisbane until the 1950s, when she was scrapped. In 1958, Gayundah was run aground at Woody Point near Redcliffe, {{to serve as a}} breakwater structure.|$|E
500|$|Sava {{was again}} raised and {{refurbished}} after World War II. Armed with two single [...] gun turrets, three single [...] gun mounts and six [...] weapons, she {{served in the}} Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962. Afterwards, she was placed {{into the hands of}} a state-owned company, which was privatised after the breakup of Yugoslavia. In 2005, the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum, though little else had been done to restore her as of 2014, by which time she was serving as a <b>gravel</b> <b>barge.</b> In December 2015, Sava was acquired by the Serbian Ministry of Defence and Belgrade's Military Museum, which plan on restoring her. The ship is one of only two surviving Austro-Hungarian river monitors that served during World War I. The other is SMS Leitha, a much older monitor, which has been a museum ship anchored alongside the Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest since 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, an {{electrical}} fault caused the drawspan to open during rush hour, causing one death and five injuries. In 2000, a <b>gravel</b> <b>barge</b> struck the bridge, closing it for eleven days and causing $500,000 worth of damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of marine traffic consists of log tows and <b>gravel</b> <b>barges,</b> which {{are permitted to}} use the navigation channel beneath the fixed span between piers 5 and 6. The swing span is used for wood chip barges and other vessels which cannot navigate beneath the span between piers 5 and 6.|$|R
50|$|While the river's source lies over 300 ft {{above sea}} level, it descends to 50 ft within about 0.4 mi. The river is fully tidal 11 mi from its mouth, {{indicating}} its slight gradient through the marshes below Petaluma. The United States Army Corps of Engineers dredges this section {{to keep it}} navigable by <b>gravel</b> <b>barges</b> and pleasure craft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site was}} used as gravel pits between 1929 and 1967, and is still owned by CEMEX, the gravel {{extraction}} company, who continue to extract sand and gravel from neighbouring areas. Working <b>gravel</b> <b>barges</b> still pass through the site. As sections of the site are worked out they are restored as wetland. In 2010 an area known as Thrumpton's Land was restored in this way. [...] The reserve was established {{at the completion of}} an earlier phase of workings, in 1966 and was opened by the naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} paid off from service on 23 November 1945 and {{returned}} to her civilian owners on 22 July 1946. She was sold in 1951 to Lumbar Operators Pty Ltd and in 1954 to Allen Taylor & Co. as a timber transport vessel. She was later sold in 1961 and converted into a <b>gravel</b> <b>barge</b> and used on the Brisbane River until 1979. She was scuttled off Tangalooma, Queensland.|$|E

50|$|The 1974 floods caused {{large-scale}} {{damage to}} Jindalee, including inundating of many houses, {{as well as}} severe damage to the Centenary Bridge. A <b>gravel</b> <b>barge</b> rammed into the upstream side, blocking the floodwaters and raising real fears that the bridge would collapse. The barge was partly sunk using explosives to reduce the floodwater pressure on the bridge. When the floodwater receded the barge was refloated and beached downstream to be cut up for scrap. The damage sustained by the bridge required its partial closure for repairs. For {{two years after the}} floods, the bridge was reduced to a single lane. The bridge was duplicated in 1980, providing two lanes each way.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and <b>gravel</b> <b>barges.</b>|$|R
25|$|Several crane barges {{were also}} used to place sandbags and <b>gravel,</b> and other <b>barges</b> were used to haul equipment, pumps, {{generators}} and people to sites.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the river}} is used commercially by tourboats and sand and <b>gravel</b> mining <b>barges.</b> It also is used by canoe outfitters and ferry boat excursions. Numerous trails travel along the river and up over the bluffs, giving the hiker a glimpse of ducks, herons, beavers and other species of {{wildlife}} which may be seen along the river.|$|R
50|$|Sava {{was again}} raised and {{refurbished}} after World War II.

40|$|This {{vessel was}} built at Collingwood, Ontario in 1916 by Collingwood Shipbuilding Company Ltd. She was of 2, 060 gross tons. She {{was owned by}} the Imperial Oil, Ltd. of Toronto, Ontario until 1959. From 1917 to 1961, she {{was known as the}} "Imperial Kingston. " In 1959, she was owned by A. B. McLean and Son of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. In 1961, her name was changed to the "Charles W. Johnson. " That year she was changed to a sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>barge...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two {{years into}} his {{retirement}} at Meung-sur-Loire, Maigret {{has yet to}} be tempted to take on a case. But 82-year-old Bernadette Amorelle, the widow of Amorelle of Amorelle and Campois, the major <b>gravel</b> and <b>barge</b> company on the Seine, shows up at his door and virtually orders him to Orsennes, where her 18-year-old granddaughter, Monita Malik, has been found dead in the Seine. Maigret arrives and finds an old acquaintance from his days at lycée in Moulins, Ernest Malik, who they'd called [...] "The Tax Collector" [...] after his father's occupation, the sort of man Maigret instinctively disliked. It is made clear that Maigret's presence in Orsenne is unwelcome, but Maigret is intrigued by the apparent disappearance of Malik's younger son, Georges-Henry Malik.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} issues on South Maury Island is the destruction of eelgrass beds with the proposed expansion by Glacier Northwest. Part of the allure of the Maury Island location is the site's proximity to the Puget Sound waterway. Glacier Northwest ships gravel by truck and by <b>barge,</b> but shipping <b>gravel</b> by <b>barge</b> is cheaper than by truck, so the gravel mine will use a dock (Glacier Northwest). The existing dock {{on the eastern shore}} is [...] "dilapidated" [...] (Preserve Our Islands-Eelgrass). Glacier Northwest has agreed to expand this dock to distances that reduce the risk of damaging the local habitat, yet many concerns still remain, including the potential damage to the local eelgrass habitat, {{a vital part of the}} salmon’s livelihood. According to Dr. David Jay's Propeller Wash Analysis Study of 2002, expanding the dock out as Glacier Northwest has proposed will not significantly reduce this risk (Preserve Our Islands-Eelgrass). The construction of the dock could also stand to disturb the habitat.|$|R
5000|$|According to University of Washington {{research}} scientist David Bain, this orca population is [...] "teetering {{on the brink}} of extinction" [...] (Ervin 2004). Bain suggested that the Glacier Northwest’s proposed dock expansion, along with the frequent tug and barge traffic used to load and transport the gravel, could deter the orcas from utilizing this area. The noise created by loading the <b>gravel</b> onto the <b>barges</b> would be magnified by the water and, at full proposed operation, would be fairly constant. Bain, who is studying the effects of noise on the orcas for the National Marine Fisheries Service, suggests that being deterred from using this area could contribute to the extinction of this resident population.|$|R
2500|$|Contracts for {{constructing}} a new [...] runway, 32/14, were awarded in late November 1955 to R. B. Tyler and Hyde Construction Co. of Jackson, Mississippi, whose $3,191,577 bid {{was the lowest}} received for the project, said Col. Walter W.
