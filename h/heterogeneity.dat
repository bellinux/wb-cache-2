The presence of <b>heterogeneities</b> {{can influence the}} evolution of the medium, in particular scroll waves may pin to such <b>heterogeneities.</b> We show that as a result the medium may be stabilized by <b>heterogeneities</b> of a suitably chosen geometry.

40|$|AbstractIt is well {{understood}} that spatially correlated <b>heterogeneities</b> can affect large-scale CO 2 migrations in geological sequestration. However, recent experimental observations from high resolution Computed Tomography (CT) imaging have shown <b>heterogeneities</b> at the millimeter scale in natural sandstone core samples. These <b>heterogeneities</b> {{have a high}} degree of randomness without distinct spatial patterns, and they appear relatively homogeneous at a larger scale. As a result, such <b>heterogeneities</b> tend to be ignored in core analysis and in flow simulations. In this study, we show that ignoring such small-scale <b>heterogeneities</b> can lead to significant overestimations of CO 2 plume speed in modeling buoyancy-driven CO 2 migrations. For the representative examples we study, the overestimation can be a factor of two or larger...|$|R

This <b>heterogeneity</b> or inconsistency {{from generation to}} generation, despite nearly identical genomic sequences, is evidence that mega-telomeres promote recombination during meiosis. Furthermore, the preferential location on microchromsomes and the discovery of an extremely large mega-telomere on the female-specific W chromosome of avian species also signify the role of mega-telomeres.|$|E

Because habitat <b>heterogeneity</b> is correlated with species diversity, levees can cause reductions in the overall biodiversity of riparian ecosystems.|$|E
