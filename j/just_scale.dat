For example, Panah and Heath Jr [14] and Roemer and Haardt [15] have proposed channel estimation techniques to supplement their designs.

He described a 7-limit double diatonic <b>just</b> <b>scale</b> to distinguish it from the usual diatonic scale, which he called the triple diatonic, with common tones from tonic, dominant and subdominant major triads. The new scale replaced subdominant pitches with the [...] "perfect seventh and ninth of the dominant harmony" [...] to correspond better with what he heard harmonically and melodically {{in all kinds of}} music. Poole proposed using five parallel chains of fifths from 1/1, 5/4, 25/16, 7/4 and 35/16, which he distinguished by type and case. One octave needed 100 different pitches to play in 19 different keys.|$|E

5000|$|Violins are {{tuned in}} perfect fifths, {{like all the}} orchestral strings (violin, viola, cello) except the double bass, which is tuned in perfect fourths. Each {{subsequent}} note is stopped at a pitch the player perceives as the most harmonious, [...] "when unaccompanied, violinist does not play consistently in either the tempered or the natural <b>just</b> <b>scale,</b> but tends on the whole to conform with the Pythagorean scale." [...] When violinists are playing in a string quartet or a string orchestra, the strings typically [...] "sweeten" [...] their tuning to suit the key they are playing in. When playing with an instrument tuned to equal temperament, such as a piano, skilled violinists adjust their tuning to match the equal temperament of the piano to avoid discordant notes. The fingers are conventionally numbered 1 (index) through 4 (little finger) in music notation, such as sheet music and etude books. Especially in instructional editions of violin music, numbers over the notes may indicate which finger to use, with 0 or O indicating an open string. The chart to the right shows the arrangement of notes reachable in first position. Not shown on this chart {{is the way the}} spacing between note positions becomes closer as the fingers move up (in pitch) from the nut.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{families}} of tuning systems: equal temperament and just tuning.

5000|$|In {{the years}} 2000-2004, Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz worked {{together}} in Berlin {{to develop a}} method to exactly indicate pitches in staff notation. This method was called the extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI pitch notation. Sabat and Schweinitz take the [...] "conventional" [...] flats, naturals and sharps as a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F proceeds C G D A E B F and so on. The advantage for musicians is that conventional reading of the basic fourths and fifths remains familiar. Such an approach has also been advocated by Daniel James Wolf and by Joe Monzo, who refers to it by the acronym HEWM (Helmholtz-Ellis-Wolf-Monzo). In the Sabat-Schweinitz design, syntonic commas are marked by arrows attached to the flat, natural or sharp sign, septimal commas using Giuseppe Tartini's symbol, and undecimal quartertones using the common practice quartertone signs (a single cross and backwards flat). For higher primes, additional signs have been designed. To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). The convention used is that the cents written refer to the tempered pitch implied by the flat, natural, or sharp sign and the note name. One of the great advantages of any such a notation {{is that it allows}} the natural harmonic series to be precisely notated. A complete legend and fonts for the notation (see samples) are open source and available from Plainsound Music Edition.

In the system we considered in this work, all subcarriers have the same frequency occupancy. Hence, the plots for spectral efficiency against error probability or blocklength are <b>just</b> a <b>scaling</b> on the y-axis of Figs.  3 and 4. On the other hand, for the energy efficiency, based on Proposition 2, we can derive that the energy consumption of all these schemes are the same, i.e., the maximum.

In summary, both the energy and the spectral efficiency performance of these schemes are <b>just</b> <b>scaling</b> of their throughput plots. Hence, the proposed scheme always outperforms the mix-scheme with respects to throughput, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Statistical systems near a {{classical}} critical point have been intensively studied both from theoretical and experimental points of view. In particular, correlation functions are of relevance in comparing theoretical models with the experimental data of real systems. In order to compute physical quantities near {{a critical point}} one needs to know the model at the critical (conformal) point.

30|$|A {{first step}} towards an {{integration}} {{of these cases}} is a hybrid source identification (HSI) approach that exploits still images for estimating the fingerprint {{that will be used}} to verify the source of a video, as proposed in [4]. Authors of [4] investigate the geometrical relation between image and video acquisition processes. Indeed, even if the sensor is the same, videos are usually acquired at a much lower resolution than images: top-level smartphones reach 4 K video resolution at most (8 megapixels per frame), but can easily capture 20 -megapixel images. To achieve that, in video recording, a central crop is carried so to adapt the sensor size to the desired aspect ratio (commonly 16 : 9), then the selected pixels are scaled to match the desired video resolution. As a direct consequence, the fingerprints extracted from images and videos cannot be directly compared and most of the times, because of cropping, it is not sufficient to <b>just</b> <b>scale</b> them to the same resolution. Instead, image-based and video-based fingerprints are linked by the cropping and scaling factors between image and video sensor portion, that usually change across different device models.|$|E

An efficient methodology and associated tools for designing aircraft for minimized sonic booms are presented. The computer-based preliminary design tool, RapidF, based on modified linear theory, enables quick assessment of an aircraft 2 ̆ 7 s sonic boom with run times less than 30 seconds on a desktop computer. A unique feature of RapidF is that it tracks where on the aircraft each segment of the of the sonic boom came from, enabling precise modifications, speeding the design process. Sonic booms from RapidF are compared to flight test data, showing that it is capability of predicting a sonic boom duration, overpressure, and interior shock locations. After the preliminary design is complete, scaled flight tests should be conducted to validate the low boom design. When conducting such tests, it is insufficient to <b>just</b> <b>scale</b> the length; thus, equations to scale the weight and propagation distance are derived. Using RapidF, a conceptual supersonic business jet design is presented that uses F-function lobe balancing to create a frozen sonic boom using lifting surfaces.

40|$|The force {{response}} of the locust hind leg extensor muscle to input excitation pulses is modelled. Despite the processes behind muscle contraction being well established, no broadly valid method of modelling skeletal muscle exists. Studies that compare the merits of existing models are extremely scarce and researchers make various assumptions {{in order to simplify}} the complex, nonlinear behaviour of the muscle. Locusts provide an opportunity to develop a muscle model in a simpler system, that will still show similar properties to that of mammalian muscles. In developing a model previous work is considered, and complexity is introduced in the experimental conditions in stages. This meant a model could be built up in parts. This approach reduces the need for questionably valid assumptions. The main focus of this work is modelling activated isometric muscle. Experimental data was collected by stimulating the extensor muscle and measuring the force generated at the tibia. In the first instance the response to individual stimulus pulses is modelled. This is extended to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the isometric force response to general pulse train inputs. In developing the model, data was fit to existing models, and from this an improved isometric model developed. The effect of changing the isometric muscle length is considered. Commonly changing the muscle length is assumed to <b>just</b> <b>scale</b> the force response. This assumption is poor. The dynamics of the force response were found to be modifed by the change in muscle length, and the isometric model adapted to include this dependency. Results related to the non-isometric behaviour are also presented. Passive muscle is usually just modelled over the lengthening period, however, the whole stretch-shorten cycle is considered here. A model, adapted from the standard linear model, is developed to describe the passive force response. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
