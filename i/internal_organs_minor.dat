40|$|Even {{though the}} number of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> {{impairments}} who registered their disabilities is small, it has steadily increased, but their employment rate is still very low; in Japan, the kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments had increased since 1967 through 1998; and in South Korea, as the categories of disabilities have been expanded, those of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairment have been expanded. Even though the kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have been expanded and the population with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments has also increased, the studies on <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have not been actively carried out. Therefore, this study aimed {{to find out the}} tasks to promote the employment of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments in Japan and South Korea by analyzing the current situation of their employment and considering the problems in it, since the systems of both countries are similar. As for this study, the pertinent data to the employment of persons with disabilities that had been disclosed by both governments were analyzed and the precedent studies were collected and analyzed to find out its problems and tasks for the promotion of their employment. In the results of analyzing the current situation of the employment of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments and its problems in Japan and South Korea, {{it was found that the}} tasks have to be undertaken; the creation of diverse jobs that are proper for persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairmen...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} to what extent fifth grade students located the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of human body. Study group consisted of 150 students at two primary schools in Balıkesir in northwest of Turkey during the fall term of 2011 - 2012 academic years. Data were collected by Locate <b>Internal</b> <b>Organs</b> Questionnaire consisting of two open-ended questions. In the first question (written question), the names with numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body were given to the students and the students were asked to locate the numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of the human body. In the second question (written-visual question), the names and images with numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body were given to the students and the students were asked to locate the numbers of the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> on the outline of the human body. The data was analyzed by descriptive analysis method. The study results revealed that the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body signed the most correctly were esophagus, trachea, lungs on the outline of the human body for the written and written-visual questions, while the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body signed the least correctly were spleen, pancreas, intestines for both of the questions. The students’ total correct answers were mostly at the category of partly right to both written and written-visual questions. However, most of the students tended to sign much more <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> in the human body in the written-visual question correctly than those of the written question...|$|R

40|$|The {{carotenoids}} in mysis and the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid were extracted, purified on the columns, {{characterized by}} absorption spectra, the {{behavior on the}} columns, absorption maxima of the reduction and co-chromatography with authentic samples. In the mysis, the existence of β-carotene, echinenone, isocryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, and crustaxanthin was confirmed. In the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid, astaxanthin was found. The content of astaxanthin was most abundant amoung each pigment in mysis and the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid. It was clarified that mysis and <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of squid were good additives to the food for sea bream {{in order to improve}} their reddish brightness. It was assumed that in mysis β-carotene would be converted to astaxanthin through the steps of isocryptoxanthin, echinenone, and canthaxanthin. ...|$|R

40|$|Gross {{dissection}} for demonstrating {{anatomy of}} the human pelvis has traditionally involved one of two approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages. Classic hemisection in the median plane through the pelvic ring transects the visceral organs but maintains two symmetric pelvic halves. An alternative paramedial transection compromises {{one side of the}} bony pelvis but leaves the <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> intact. The authors propose a modified technique that combines advantages of both classical dissections. This novel approach involves dividing the pubic symphysis and sacrum in the median plane after shifting all <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> to one side. The hemipelvis without <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> is immediately available for further dissection of the lower limb. The hemipelvis with intact <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> is ideal for showing the complex spatial relationships of the pelvic organs and vessels relative to the intact pelvic floor...|$|R
40|$|In South Korea, the <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> {{impairments}} {{have six}} scopes including kidney, heart, respiratory organs, liver, colostomy and epilepsy. Among the total 2, 513, 000 persons who registered their disabilities, there are 117, 000 persons (4. 7 %) with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairment, which occupies the smallest portion among the entire registered disabled persons. The {{reason that the}} number of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments is relatively small is because of the intricacy of the criteria for grading and procedure for registration. In results, persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have not sufficiently taken advantage of the benefits from government and others comparing with persons with other types of disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to. understand the actual condition and problems of disability registration procedure and the criteria for grading and to make suggestions; {{to increase the number of}} registered persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments and to provide them with benefits and services of government, (1) the disability registration procedure needs to be simplified, (2) the disability grading system needs to be modified and the re-evaluation, and (3) the expansion of the category of disability...|$|R

40|$|Background: Currently, {{presence}} of Moraxella sp. in <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> of fish {{is not considered}} detrimental for fish farming. However, bacterial colonization of <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> can affect fish wellness and decrease growth rate, stress resistance, and immune response. Recently, {{there have been reports}} by farmers concerning slow growth, poor feed conversion, and low average weight increase of fish farmed in offshore floating sea cages, often associated with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> colonization by Moraxella sp. Therefore, {{presence of}} these opportunistic bacteria deserves further investigations for elucidating incidence and impact on fish metabolism. Results: A total of 960 gilthead sea breams (Sparus aurata, L.), collected along 17 months from four offshore sea cage plants and two natural lagoons in Sardinia, were subjected to routine microbiological examination of <b>internal</b> <b>organs</b> throughout the production cycle.
