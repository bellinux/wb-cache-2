6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Mr. Lincoln, incredulously. [...] "And <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> {{that you}} come {{to me with a}} message from a rank Abolitionist lawyer in St. Louis?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But, Conway, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen?</b> Do {{you think}} it is true? That man would say {{anything}} to gain his object. Is he here now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mamma, {{you have}} been in this {{neighbourhood}} before. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that when you reappeared here with Miss Keeldar you were not recognized?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Mr. Kernan, {{trying to}} {{remember}}. [...] "I remember {{now there was}} a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to know}} that, too," [...] said Dorothy. [...] "But, tell me; <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> {{that you}} are able to talk? I thought hens could only cluck and cackle." ...|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that men in high state of moral culture are often insensible to the {{influence}} of material beauty, and insist feebly upon it as an instrument of soul culture.|$|R

6000|$|There remain, however, {{two points}} {{to be noticed}} before I can hope that this {{conclusion}} will be frankly accepted by the reader. If it be the moral part of us to which beauty addresses itself, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>it</b> will be asked, that it is ever found {{in the works of}} impious men, and how is it possible for such to desire or conceive it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The cities breed felons," [...] he remarked. [...] "It is a pity {{so young}} a girl should have chosen so {{dangerous}} and disastrous a career. It is inevitably disastrous. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that Colonel Hathaway allowed you {{to impose on}} him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Albemarle laughed, and Sir Edward smiled. [...] "You robbed him, eh?" [...] said His Grace. [...] "Very well.

[...] Be quiet, and unclench your fist! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you don't see my point," [...] he said gently. [...] "What I mean is: {{if you love}} me, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that you love me now {{so much more than}} you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{the revelation}} of the {{circumstances}} under which she was found, the revelations contained in her letters to the Senate, and the revelations which one imagines must have followed her return to her husband, confirm past rumours and convict Cesare of the outrage, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that Sanuto--who has never failed to record anything that could tell against Cesare--should be silent on the matter? And <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that so many pens that busied themselves greedily with scandal that touched the Borgias should be similarly silent? Is it unreasonable to infer that those revelations did not incriminate him--that they gave the lie to all the rumours that had been current? If that is not the inference, then what is? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God keep thee, stranger; what is thy name?" [...] "Wisdom. And thine?" [...] "Knowledge. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that we meet?"

60|$|Further reflection. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> that RICHARDS'S name {{remained}} in Stephenson's mind as indicating the right man, {{and not some}} other man's name? That looked good. Yes, that looked very good. In fact it went on looking better and better, straight along--until by-and-by it grew into positive PROOF. And then Richards put the matter at once out of his mind, for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is better left so.|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} the doctor's inquiry <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen,</b> and was anyone to blame, Tom Tootle gives in his verdict, {{unavoidable}} accident and {{no one to blame}} but the sufferer. 'He was slinking about in his boat,' says Tom, 'which slinking were, not to speak ill of the dead, the manner of the man, when he come right athwart the steamer's bows and she cut him in two.' Mr Tootle is so far figurative, touching the dismemberment, as that he means the boat, and not the man. For, the man lies whole before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since when have {{children}} like {{you come to}} the knowledge of storms? And who is the man who has plotted the hurricane-courses of the Paumotus? What books will you find it in? I sailed the Paumotus before the oldest of you drew breath. I know. To the eastward the paths of the hurricanes are on so wide a circle they make a straight line. To the westward here they make a sharp curve. Remember your chart. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> the hurricane of '91 swept Auri and Hiolau? The curve, my brave boy, the curve! In an hour, or two or three at most, will come the wind. Listen to that!" ...|$|E
