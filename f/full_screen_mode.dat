500|$|A new {{iteration}} of the Start menu {{is used on}} the Windows 10 desktop, with a list {{of places}} and other options on the left side, and tiles representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode. A new virtual desktop system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped {{to one side of the}} screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called [...] "Snap Assist"). Windows' system icons were also changed.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{interface}} of KitKat further downplays the [...] "Holo" [...] interface appearance introduced on 4.0, replacing remaining {{instances of}} blue accenting with greys and white (such as the status bar icons). Apps may trigger a translucent status and navigation bar appearance, or trigger a <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> ("Immersive mode") to hide them entirely. The launcher {{also received a}} refreshed appearance, {{with the implementation of}} the translucent navigation bars, and the replacement of the black backdrop in the application drawer with a translucent backdrop. Additionally, action overflow menu buttons in apps are always visible, even on devices with the deprecated [...] "Menu" [...] navigation key. In the Settings menu, users can now specify a default Home (launcher) and text messaging app.|$|E

5000|$|In Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Konqueror for KDE, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer for Windows, the {{function}} key F11 key toggles <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> viewing <b>mode.</b> In macOS, F11 hides all open windows.|$|R
50|$|The LMS option loads ANTIC's {{screen memory}} scan address with the 16-bit {{value in the}} two bytes {{following}} the instruction. The Character or Map mode specified will begin displaying bytes from that address. The LMS option must appear in the first Playfield Mode Instruction line (not Blank Line) in the Display List to initialize ANTIC to begin reading {{at the start of}} screen memory. Most of the Operating System-generated <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>modes</b> will have only that one occurrence of the LMS modifier present in the Display List. ANTIC will automatically increment its LMS address {{at the end of each}} mode line in preparation for the next line. As long as screen memory does not cross over a 4K boundary the LMS modifier is not needed on subsequent Playfield Mode Instructions.|$|R
50|$|It also {{includes}} <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> which only displays the text.|$|E
5000|$|Support for Mac OS X Lion {{features}} such as versions, auto save, and <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since ANTIC's memory scan counter cannot {{automatically}} increment over a 4K boundary {{the limit}} of vertical scrolling in this simple manner is up to 4K of movement. A <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> of <b>Mode</b> 2 text using approximately 1K can continuously scroll the height of four screens until reaching the 4K boundary. Likewise, a Mode 7 text display can scroll the height of 16 entire screens.|$|R
50|$|The first {{implementation}} of scRGB was the GDI+ API in Windows Vista. At WinHEC 2008 Microsoft announced that Windows 7 would support 48-bit scRGB (which for HDMI {{can be converted}} and output as xvYCC). The components in Windows 7 that support 48-bit scRGB are Direct3D, the Windows Imaging Component, and the Windows Color System and they support it in both <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> exclusive <b>mode</b> and in video overlays.|$|R
50|$|Some of its {{features}} include {{the ability to}} view and bookmark PDFs, highlight and underline selectable PDF text, and a <b>Full</b> <b>Screen</b> and Presentation <b>mode.</b> It also allows the adding of circles and boxes, {{as well as being}} able to embed and edit notes.|$|R
5000|$|The green [...] "zoom" [...] {{button on}} windows {{now has a}} {{different}} function in applications that support <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode.</b> Instead of simply enlarging the window, the button now enters <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> eliminating the full screen button at the top right corner of windows that has been present since Mac OS X Lion. However, holding the Option key (‚å•) while clicking the zoom button or double-clicking on the window chrome continues to invoke the original behavior.|$|E
50|$|Adjustable display modes. In PlayStation 2 version, it {{includes}} 2 portrait and 2 landscape modes. In Windows version, {{it includes}} window mode, <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> adjustable zoom ratios (x0.5, x1.0, x1.5, x2.0).|$|E
50|$|Share can use two capture methods: Frame Buffer Capture (NVFBC) and Inband Frame Readback (NVIFR). NVFBC {{is used in}} <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode.</b> NVIFR is used in windowed mode {{only because}} it has a higher {{performance}} impact.|$|E
5000|$|The FactoryPMI Runtime or Client is a Java {{application}} typically {{launched from}} a web browser. It {{acts as the}} HMI interface for end users {{and can be used}} to view realtime or historical process data or control industrial applications. The runtime can be launched one of three ways. As an Applet inside a web browser, via Java Web Start, or in <b>Full</b> <b>Screen</b> Exclusive <b>mode,</b> where it occupies the whole screen without borders or toolbars, typical of an industrial Touchscreen application.|$|R
50|$|TSO {{interacts with}} users {{in either a}} line-by-line mode or in a <b>full</b> <b>screen,</b> {{menu-driven}} <b>mode.</b> In the line-by-line mode, the user enters commands by typing them in at the keyboard; in turn, the system interprets the commands, and then displays responses on the terminal screen. But most mainframe interaction is actually via ISPF, which allows for customized menu-driven interaction. This combination is called TSO/ISPF. TSO can also provide a Unix-style environment on OS/390 and z/OS via the UNIX System Services command shell, with or without ISPF.|$|R
50|$|Protext is a British word {{processing}} program, developed by Arnor Ltd, of Peterborough {{in the decade}} following 1985. Originally written for the Amstrad CPC464, it was later sold for the Amstrad PCW series of word processors, for MS-DOS based PCs, the Atari ST, and the Commodore Amiga. A version was developed for the Acorn Archimedes and released in October 1990 which ran in <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> text <b>mode,</b> an accompanying note in the box mentioned Arnor's intention to develop a future release that would support operation in the RISC OS desktop with drag and drop capabilities, etc. but this was never developed.|$|R
50|$|Nokia 7500 has {{a stereo}} FM radio and a music player which can play mp3, wma {{and several other}} formats. It can play 3gp and mp4 video. The videos {{can be seen in}} <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> too.|$|E

5000|$|RealVNC clients using [...] can run in full-screen mode; {{they use}} the F8 function-key as the default key for {{bringing}} up an options menu (which includes the option to, among other things, switch off <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> or to forward a Control-Alt-Delete key-sequence).|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Gold Box Engine" [...] had {{two main}} game play modes. Outside of {{character}} creation, game play {{took place in}} a screen that displayed text interactions, the names and current status of your party of characters, and a window which displayed images of geography, and large or small pictures of characters or events. When combat occurred, which was often in these games, you switched to a <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> combat <b>mode,</b> in which player character icons could move about to cast spells or attack icons representing the enemies. All the games typically involved long dungeon crawls, and were heavier on combat than on role-playing.|$|R
50|$|Windows Live Messenger's album {{viewer is}} based on Windows Photo Gallery and {{provides}} users a photo viewing experience for photo albums shared via SkyDrive and Facebook. The album viewer is interactive and supports <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> and slideshow <b>modes,</b> as well as viewing and uploading comments on Facebook and SkyDrive albums. It also supports people tagging for SkyDrive. The album viewer closely resembles the Microsoft Silverlight counterpart for web photo albums present on SkyDrive.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{programs}} with a graphical interface simulate the display style of text mode programs, notably {{when it is}} important to preserve the vertical alignment of text, e.g., during computer programming. There exist also software components to emulate text mode, such as terminal emulators or command line consoles. In Microsoft Windows, the Win32 console usually opens in emulated, graphical window mode. It can be switched to <b>full</b> <b>screen,</b> true text <b>mode</b> and vice versa by pressing the Alt and Enter keys together. This is no longer supported by the WDDM display drivers introduced with Windows Vista.|$|R
5000|$|Full-screen apps - Native, {{system-wide}} {{support for}} full-screen applications running {{in their own}} space. Supporting applications display a new button at the top right of application window, this button opens applications in full-screen mode. However, <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> is not supported for dual screen setups.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} 32 kB BBC Model B version uses {{a specially}} defined screen resolution (eight physical colours; 128 pixels across &times; 128 lines down = 8 kB screen memory), smaller than <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>MODE</b> 2. This is {{to free up}} memory for game data - a common technique in complex BBC games.|$|E
50|$|On October 13, 2009 Marvel {{launched}} an upgraded {{version of the}} comic viewer, dubbed the Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited Reader 3.0. The new digital comics reader added {{a number of new}} features including <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> <b>mode,</b> thumbnails for all pages, and easier ways of finding books related to the one being read.|$|E
50|$|The {{rest of the}} {{interface}} was closely modeled on MacPaint's, with a palette of familiar tools such as the Pencil, Paintbrush, and Paint Bucket, which have survived today in Adobe Systems Photoshop. FullPaint also introduced the <b>screen</b> <b>modes</b> (windowed, <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> with menubar, and <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> without menubar) and the iconic selectors for them which were later used in Photoshop.|$|R
50|$|Aemulor Pro adds {{support for}} low-bpp <b>screen</b> <b>modes,</b> sound, {{hardware}} emulation of VIDC/IOC, an altered memory map and 26-bit filing systems. Some software, such as Sibelius, can be run {{both in the}} desktop and in <b>full</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R

40|$|Computer {{games are}} often played on devices with varying display resolutions. While higher resolutions {{generally}} provide more immersive game play they can yield reduced frame rates and/or increased costs, making choosing the optimal resolution important. Despite this importance, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, there has been no extensive study of the effects of resolution on users playing computer games. This paper presents results from extensive user studies measuring the impact of resolution on users playing First Person Shooter games. The studies focus on the effects of resolution in conjunction with low and high contrast virtual environments, <b>full</b> <b>screen</b> and windowed <b>modes</b> and identification of long-range objects. Analysis indicates resolution has little impact on performance over the range of conditions tested and only matters when the objects being identified are far away or small and are reduced to too few pixels to be distinguishable. 1...|$|R
