For months he lived among people whose fathers had helped Lincoln survey land, build fences and drive hogs to market. For months he delved <b>among</b> <b>old</b> <b>books,</b> letters, speeches, half-forgotten {{newspapers}} and musty court records, trying to understand Lincoln.|$|R

2500|$|In Arthur Conan Doyle's first {{short story}} about Holmes for The Strand, Doctor Watson {{noted that the}} detective [...] "loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul" [...] and [...] "remained in our lodgings in Baker-street, buried <b>among</b> his <b>old</b> <b>books</b> and {{alternating}} from week to week between cocaine and ambition..". Designer Savannah Miller, elder sister of actress Sienna Miller, described a [...] "real bohemian" [...] as [...] "someone who {{has the ability to}} appreciate beauty on a deep level, is a profound romantic, doesn't know any limits, whose world is their [...] own creation, rather than living in a box".|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning he}} spent rummaging <b>among</b> the <b>old</b> <b>books,</b> dipping listlessly {{here and there}} as the {{tasteless}} fancy took him, while Herbert sat writing with serene face and lifted eyebrows at his open window. But the unfamiliar long S's, the close type, and the spelling of the musty <b>old</b> <b>books</b> wearied eye and mind. What he read, too, however far-fetched, or lively, or sententious, or gross, seemed either {{to be of the}} same texture as what had become his everyday experience, and so baffled him with its nearness, or else was only the meaningless ramblings of an idle pen. And this, he thought to himself, looking covertly up at the spruce clear-cut profile at the window, this is what Herbert had called Life.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 8: The {{original}} edition of 'Drunken Barnaby's Journal', a small square volume, without date, was probably printed about 1650. The author {{was supposed to}} be Barnaby Harrington of Queen's College, Oxford. But Joseph Haslewood, whose edition (1818) is the best, attributed it to Richard Brathwait (circ. 1588-1673). The title of the second edition (1716) runs as follows: 'Drunken Barnaby's Four Journeys to the North of England. In Latin and English Verse. Wittily and merrily (tho' near one hundred years ago) composed; found <b>among</b> some <b>old</b> musty <b>books,</b> that had a long time lain by in a corner; and now at last made publick. To which is added, Bessy Bell'.|$|R
60|$|I {{had seen}} little of Holmes lately. My {{marriage}} had drifted {{us away from}} each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried <b>among</b> his <b>old</b> <b>books,</b> and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa {{in the case of}} the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.|$|R
50|$|MT's {{latest novel}} is Varanasi (2002) {{which is an}} {{emotional}} journey to Varanasi, a pilgrim centre in North India. Varanasi opens with Professor Srinivasan’s letter to Sudhakaran, the protagonist, referring to his unfinished thesis <b>among</b> his <b>old</b> <b>books.</b> The professor invites him {{to his home in}} Varanasi. Sudharkaran, in his sixties, and recovering from a prostrate procedure, decides to take the professor by surprise. He realises on arrival that the professor has recently died. The story evolves with a series of reminiscences, like a REM stream, in time transitions. The narration involves the third, first, and second person. In the train to Varanasi, Sudhakaran fishes out the book Kashi: The Eternal City by Sumita Nagpal, in which he is also acknowledged. By the time Sudhakaran finishes the book, he has traversed his life, his women, seen the demise of his well-wishers, moved through Varanasi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Paris, and Madras. He sees no need to complete his thesis — 'about the possibilities of Caliban' as once suggested by his professor for a scholarship at the university — and lets it go into the Ganga. He does the professor’s last rites as also his own Atma Pindom (One's own funeral rites in anticipation of death). At the Dashashwamedh Ghat, Sumita, now an elderly woman, merely passes him by, not even recognising him. With no intricate plot, the novel is an experiment. It was well received in the literary circles but received criticism from critic and painter M. V. Devan.|$|R

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} how content-enriched catalogue records impact the circulation rates of print resources in four subject areas, and to investigate how this additional metadata influences OPAC searching and item retrieval. Design – Analysis of circulation data, bibliographic records, and OPAC search logs. Setting – A library at a four-year undergraduate residential {{college in the}} North-eastern United States. Subjects – Bibliographic records for 88, 538 titles; data from 7, 782 circulation transactions; and 130 OPAC search strings and related circulation data. Methods – In {{the first part of}} the study, bibliographic records for print items published since 1990 were extracted from the library’s integrated library system (ILS) in the following Library of Congress (LC) classes: D, E, F, H, J, L, P, Q, R, S, and T. It is assumed that electronic books were excluded from this study because their usage is not tracked in the ILS. These LC classes were chosen to correspond to the subject areas targeted by the researchers for comparison – “history, social sciences, language and literature, and science and technology” (p. 416). The data file included the publication date of the title, as well as values for the MARC fields identified by the researchers as containing content-enriched data. These fields were MARC 505 (an item’s table of contents or list of works included), MARC 520 (summaries or annotations), and MARC 856 (URL to electronic location of related material or electronic copy) (p. 416; Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office, 2003, 2008 a, 2008 b). The authors analyzed records for 88, 538 titles and determined the total number of records containing each of the MARC fields either singly or in combination. Data relating to circulation transactions for items located in these LC classes from January to May 2009 was also identified. Like the bibliographic records, circulation data was pulled for print items only. The researchers identified 7, 782 circulation transactions that met the study criteria for the period in question. In the second part of the study, circulation data for September 22, 2009 was obtained and sorted into the four subject categories identified in Part I of the study. The authors indicate that this date was chosen at random, but do not specify how. Researchers compared the records of the 133 titles borrowed that day from the LC classes studied to the OPAC search logs from September 16 - 22, 2009 to determine which searches led to the circulation of these items. The authors felt that searches resulting in checkouts on the day in question may have begun earlier in the week. The searches that led to borrowing were recorded and categorized as keyword, title, author, or other searches. If a user entered a title or author name into the keyword field, these were classed as known item searches in the appropriate categories. The authors identified and analyzed 130 searches relating to circulated items. Main Results – In {{the first part of the}} study, the number of catalogue records that contained MARC 505, 520, and/or 856 fields significantly increased for titles published between 1990 and 2007, with a slight decrease in 2008. MARC 505 was the most common content- enriched field until 2000, after which the presence of MARC 856 grew significantly. The MARC 520 field was used least often, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about its impact on circulation. The incidence of enhanced records was very low <b>among</b> <b>older</b> <b>books</b> in the study. Only 14. 3...|$|R

40|$|Integrated Pest Management (IPM) of {{the drug}} store beetle, Stegobium paniceum (L.), a serious pest of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> Abstract- Recently (January 2010), {{we have found that}} {{drugstore}} beetle, Stegobi-um paniceum (L.), is a serious pest of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> in a religious library in Cra-cow, Poland. About 80 % <b>old</b> <b>books</b> were found more or less damaged by this pest. As the result of larval activity, many holes and tunnels were formed in damaged books. Some of them were old, some of them were new tunnels with live larvae and pupae. Many characteristic emergence holes of the adults were found in the book bindings. Around books there was an enormous amount of dust as a result of larval feeding activity. Live and dead adults were found around <b>old</b> <b>books</b> and within the library room, especially near windows. The Integrated Pest Manage-ment program was suggested to the owners and curator of the library to control infestation and to avoid the continuation of the damage.
