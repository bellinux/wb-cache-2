40|$|High-throughput {{bisulfite}} sequencing technologies {{have provided a}} comprehensive and well-fitted way to investigate DNA methylation at single-base resolution. However, there are substantial bioinformatic challenges to distinguish precisely methylcytosines from unconverted cytosines based on {{bisulfite sequencing}} data. The challenges arise, at least in part, from cell heterozygosis caused by multicellular sequencing and the still limited number of statistical methods that are available for methylcytosine calling based on bisulfite sequencing data. Here, we present an algorithm, termed Bycom, a new Bayesian model that can perform methylcytosine calling with high accuracy. Bycom considers cell heterozygosis along with sequencing errors and bisulfite conversion efficiency to improve calling accuracy. Bycom performance was compared {{with the performance of}} Lister, the method most widely used to identify methylcytosines from bisulfite sequencing data. The results showed that the performance of Bycom was better than that of Lister for data with high methylation levels. Bycom also showed higher sensitivity and specificity for low methylation level samples (< 1 %) than Lister. A validation experiment based on reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data suggested that Bycom had a false positive rate of about 4 % while maintaining an accuracy of close to 94 %. This study demonstrated that Bycom had a low <b>false</b> <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> at any methylation level and accurate methylcytosine calling at high methylation levels. Bycom will contribute significantly to studies aimed at recalibrating the methylation level of genomic regions based on the presence of methylcytosines...|$|E

We compared the accuracy and sensitivity of SNPMClust to that of GenCall, Illumina's proprietary algorithm, on a data set of 94 whole-genome amplified buccal (cheek swab) DNA samples.

The round robin measured the crack detection capabilities of seven field inspection teams who employed procedures that met or exceeded the 1977 edition through the 1978 addenda of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section 11 Code requirements. Three different types of materials were employed in the study (cast stainless steel, clad ferritic, and wrought stainless steel), and two different types of flaws were implanted into the specimens (intergranular stress corrosion cracks (IGSCCs) and thermal fatigue cracks (TFCs)). When considering near-side inspection, far-side inspection, and <b>false</b> <b>call</b> <b>rate,</b> the overall performance was found to be best in clad ferritic, less effective in wrought stainless steel and the worst in cast stainless steel.

TOFD, like any other technique requires to be applied in a concise manner, in order to achieve the theoretical targets of high probability of detection (POD), a low <b>false</b> <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> and proof of coverage. The introduction of European and ASME standards has brought some coherence to the application of TOFD for fabrication inspection. However, a difficulty lies in the determination of actual coverage by TOFD on different geometries. Although for instance ASME specifically requires documented evidence of the coverage achieved, common practice is that at best a table is included in the procedure indicating the setups for the different weld geometries involved. To produce a documented examination strategy showing component coverage is cumbersome without software aids. Even with software tools such as professional drawing packages, producing such scan plans is not a simple task if many different geometries are involved...|$|R

The subject to detect a hidden subject by penetrating physical interaction with the target {{is similar to that of}} non-destructive testing where it is looked for hidden cracks etc. in material via waves and rays. The non destructive testing profession is now about 100 years old and developed some procedures to check reliability of testing. Those principles like the performance demonstration where the successful detections are statistically evaluated against <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> <b>rates</b> and their implementation in an industrial standard (ASME section XI appendix VIII) are analysed. A first adoption to demining was accomplished in the prescription for blind trials in the CEN workshop agreement CEN BT 126 CWA 07 for test and evaluation of metal detectors. A number of blind trials were accomplished within an ITEP project to learn about the necessary statistical layout of those trials to achieve true, reproducible and repeatable results to give guidance to selection and improvement of metal detectors. The special focus in these investigations was on the influence of the human factor due to the degree of experience of the operators and the infulence of uncooperative soil.

40|$|Next-generation massively {{parallel}} sequencing technologies provide ultrahigh throughput at two {{orders of magnitude}} lower unit cost than capillary Sanger sequencing technology. One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36 × coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92. 25 % of the diploid autosomes and 88. 07 % of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1 M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98. 6 % of the 37, 933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98 % of 999, 981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99. 97 % and 99. 84 % consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles {{and were able to}} improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model.

40|$|The total {{reliability}} of a mine searching system {{is driven by}} the triple of intrinsic capability, which describes the physical-technical basis capability, the application and environmental factors and the human factors. Some of them can be determined in laboratory measurements but the human factor and a part of environment conditions and their interaction with the device need to be treated statistically. That is why the test & evaluation procedure described in CEN CWA 14747 : 2003, includes in addition to parameter tests of metal detectors also the reliability or blind field tests under local conditions with local personnel. A series of three big field trials had been accomplished in the ITEP-project 2. 1. 1. 2 “Reliability Model for Test & Evaluation of Metal Detectors ” to specify the optimum conditions for reliable trial results with affordable effort. For each set of specific working conditions, characterized in terms of a combination of one mine type in one soil with one detector handled by local personnel, the searching system will show up a working performance in mine detection rates as a function of mine depth and show up a certain overall <b>false</b> <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> During the ITEP-trials in Benkovac and Oberjettenberg the authors learnt to determine this function separately for each mine type in each soil, which is especially important for low metal mines in uncooperative soil which will be illustrated for the mine PMA 2 in different types of soil.

40|$|The {{work of this}} Engineering Doctorate {{addresses}} {{the research and development}} of efficient Finite Element (FE) modelling techniques for calculating the ultrasonic response from rough defects for Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) applications specific to the nuclear power generation industry. The project has been carried out in collaboration with Imperial College London and Rolls-Royce allowing for the transfer of novel academic research into an applied industrial context. Within the UK nuclear power generation industry, one of the fundamental principles of regulation and operation is a robust safety culture where the highest levels of quality assurance are applied to safety critical components. This principle places a requirement on NDE to deploy reliable and accurate inspections to ensure the structural integrity of the plant and its components. To achieve this goal, modelling techniques can be used to aid in the design and justification of ultrasonic NDE inspections. For smooth, relatively large defects, analytical methods can provide an accurate scattering solution; however, for more realistic rough defects, the limitations of these methods are only applicable for specialised cases of roughness. Defects which possess rough surfaces greatly affect ultrasonic wave scattering behaviour. Ultrasonic NDE inspections of safety-critical components rely upon this response for detecting and sizing flaws. Reliable characterisation is crucial, so it is essential to find an accurate means to predict any reductions in signal amplitude. An extension of Kirchhoff theory has formed the basis for many practical applications; however, it is widely recognised that these predictions are pessimistic owing to analytical approximations. As a result, NDE inspections can be overly sensitive, meaning that small and insignificant indications are incorrectly classed as being potentially hazardous defects. This increases the likelihood of making false-calls and incurring unnecessary expenditure to the programme. A numerical full field modelling approach does not fall victim to such limitations, and therefore, FE modelling techniques have been developed to deliver a non-conservative methodology for the prediction of expected back-scattering from rough defects. This has been achieved in two parts: improved performance of absorbing boundary methods for use with commercial FE codes, and application of domain linking algorithms to NDE inspection problems. This thesis presents the development of these methods and their application to industrial NDE inspections. Ultimately, the findings of this work will aid in establishing more reliable, less conservative, reporting thresholds for the inspection of power plant components, reducing <b>false</b> <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and therefore any unnecessary expenditure.

40|$|Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) {{represent}} {{the most abundant}} type of genetic variation {{and they are a}} valuable tool for several biological applications like linkage mapping, integration of genetic and physical maps, population genetics as well as evolutionary and protein structure-function studies. SNP genotyping by mapping DNA reads produced via Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on a reference genome is a very common and convenient approach in our days, but still prone to a significant error rate. The need of defining in silico true genetic variants in genomic and transcriptomic sequences is prompted by the high costs of the experimental validation through re-sequencing or SNP arrays, {{not only in terms of}} money but also time and sample availability. Several open-source tools have been recently developed to identify small variants in whole-genome data, but still the candidate variants, provided in the VCF output format, present a high <b>false</b> positive <b>calling</b> <b>rate.</b> Goal of this thesis work is the development of a bioinformatic method that classifies variant calling outputs in order to reduce the number of <b>false</b> positive <b>calls.</b> With the aim to dissect the molecular bases of grape acidity (Vitis vinifera L.), this tool has been then used to select SNPs in two grapevine varieties, which show very different content of organic acids in the berry. The VCF parameters have been used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that classifies the VCF records in true and false positive variants, cleaning the output from the most likely false positive results. The SVM approach has been implemented in a new software, called VerySNP, and applied to model and non-model organisms. In both cases, the machine learning method efficiently recognized true positive from false positive variants in both genomic and transcriptomic sequences. In the second part of the thesis, VerySNP was applied to identify true SNPs in RNA-seq data of the grapevine variety Gora Chirine, characterized by low acidity, and Sultanine, a normal acidity variety closely related to Gora. The comparative transcriptomic analysis crossed with the SNP information lead to discover non-synonymous polymorphisms inside coding regions and, thus, provided a list of candidate genes potentially affecting acidity in grapevin...|$|R

Four types of errors were used: false, missed, stuck-on, and dropped calls. The three VD systems were installed side-by-side at an intersection in Rantoul, IL. The configurations were modified by the vendors to improve their performance. The modifications to Peek VD configuration effectively reduced dropped calls at the stop bar zones; however, {{that was at the}} expense of increasing <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during daytime and missed and <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during night time. Similarly, in the advance zones, in both daytime and nighttime, there was a clear tradeoff between decreasing missed <b>calls</b> and increasing <b>false</b> <b>calls.</b> The modifications to Autoscope VD configuration did not provide a clear improvement at the stop bar zones during daytime; however, during nighttime, <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> increased and missed calls were eliminated. In the advance zones, the Autoscope changes significantly reduced missed calls in both day and night, reduced <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> in daytime, but increased in <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> during nighttime. The modifications to Iteris VD configuration were slight and overall effects of the changes were relatively small. This resulted in a tradeoff between <b>false</b> and missed <b>calls.</b> The results for three systems indicate that there are tradeoffs when the goal is to improve the overall performance of VD systems. Thus, after making modifications to {{the configuration of}} VD systems, the effects of these changes should be monitored not only for improvements on the previously detected errors, but also for potential new errors of a different type.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{non-destructive}} testing is a renowned method for the inspection of girth welds. However, defect sizing and characterization remains challenging {{with the current}} inspection philosophy. In addition, data display and interpretation is not straightforward and requires skill and experience from the inspector. A better and more reliable inspection result would contribute to safer pipeline construction and economic benefits (like low <b>false</b> <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and the possibility to use smaller wall thickness). In seismic exploration, images of the subsurface have been obtained using acoustic data, for many years. The main objective of this thesis is to apply the imaging concepts developed in seismic exploration to the application field of ultrasonic NDI in 2 D and to give a proof of concept in 3 D. The 2 D inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX) imaging approach is presented, {{which is based on}} the Rayleigh II integral for back propagation. A 3 D imaging approach is presented called 'two pass imaging'. This approach consist of two 2 D imaging steps performed in two orthogonal directions. For homogeneous media, this two-pass process is known to be exact. With a linear array, a surface is scanned. In the direction parallel to linear array (the in-line direction) full offset imaging can be performed. In the direction perpendicular to the linear array (the cross-line direction) zero-offset imaging can be performed. The current traditional inspection philosophy is based on zonal discrimination. This philosophy is well regulated in codes and standards. From these codes and standards, a rough requirement was derived for the resolution of the IWEX imaging approach. The resolution that can be obtained with IWEX imaging is investigated on the basis of point spread functions. Aperture limitations and directivity effects of the ultrasonic elements are taken into account. Result of 2 D images from different insonification and scatter paths are presented. The data was obtained from measurements on various test blocks with machined reflections using a linear array. The test blocks also contain reflectors that are representative for actual weld defects. To demonstrate the proof of principle of 3 D IWEX imaging, test blocks were manufactured with suitable reflectors to study the characteristics of 3 D imaging. Also, a final experiment was performed on a test block with an intentional defect in a real weld. The results are presented and discussed. The IWEX imaging approach basically removes propagation effects from source to scatterer and from scatterer to receiver. In ultrasonic data from carbon steel, two wave modes exist with different sound velocities (longitudinal and transversal). To construct an image, one of these modes must be chosen for the back propagation. As a consequence, the energy in the data from the other mode is not treated correctly and will produce leakage artifacts in the image. Artifacts in L-T images caused by L-L arrivals are discussed and illustrated with an analytical example. In addition, a procedure is presented and demonstrated to suppress these artifacts. It is concluded that the IWEX imaging approach is suitable to detect, size and characterize defects that are common in girth welds. The L-L image (direct longitudinal insonification path and direct longitudinal scatter path) will usually contain the most information. However, for the area just below the surface, the LL-LL image (insonification and scatter paths via the back wall) must be used. To confirm the L-L and the LL-LL images, the L-T image (direct longitudinal insonificaton path and direct transversal scatter path) can be used, after the artifacts are suppressed with the proposed procedure. It is also concluded that 3 D IWEX imaging is feasible and that it contributes to an improved resolution in the lateral direction. Finally, recommendations are given for further research. Although ultrasonic imaging based on inverse wave field extrapolations offers a huge potential for ultrasonic NDI, still work must be done to apply IWEX in practice. Evaluation programs are necessary for the acceptance of the imaging technique. In addition, new codes and standards must be written for industrial use. Applied Science...|$|R

Lymphoscintigraphy revealed at least one sentinel node in 75 patients (90. 4 %), always identified by the probe. In eight patients (9. 6 %) the sentinel node was detected neither by lymphoscintigraphy nor by the probe. All removed lymph nodes were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin histology and the sentinel node by immunostaining. In 28 / 75 patients (37. 3 %) at least one metastatic axillary lymph node was detected; in 16 of the 28 N+ subjects (57 %) only the sentinel node was positive.

Both quadratic and linear trends were absent when OCR was assessed against number of groups present, possibly because group size increased with increasing density of whales. A linear regression on the CPW and CPG suggested that there was a negative inverse relationship with the number of whales and groups present respectively. These findings are important in that, while they preclude the estimation of absolute numbers from <b>call</b> <b>rates,</b> they imply that, under the conditions prevailing in Walker Bay, southern right whales were aware of the presence, arrival and departure of other animals in their vicinity and adjusted their vocal behaviour accordingly.

However, several reports have documented performance problems in specific systems. This paper quantifies the performance of three different commercially available video detection systems.

Prior to the May 2005 test, a representative from each vendor configured the video detection zones to match the loop detection zone as closely as possible. The outputs from the loop detection for the through-right and left-turn lane groups were compared with the corresponding output {{from each of the}} video detection systems. Whenever there was a discrepancy between the loop and video, a digital video was observed to determine the cause of the discrepancy. Missed <b>calls</b> and <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> were categorized for each system. The errors were also categorized according to the impact that they would have on signal operations. During a 24 hr test on two separate days, the number of missed detections longer than 5 seconds ranged from 9 to 147, and the number of <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> longer than 5 seconds ranged from 16 to 149...|$|R

The Damage Indices used for the inference carries marginal signal information content in order to decrease their sensitivity with respect to undesired non-controllable factors. The {{reason for that is}} to limit the <b>false</b> <b>calls</b> ratio which besides the damage detection capability of a system, plays a crucial role in applications. However even such simplified damage indices can be altered over a long term, leading to the misclassification problem. Considering single sensing path, {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish whether the resultant change of DIs is caused by a damage or due to such DIs decoherence. Therefore assessment approaches based on threshold levels fixed separately for DIs obtained on each of the sensing paths, would eventually lead to a <b>false</b> <b>call.</b> In order to decrease such misclassification risk a method to compensate the DIs drift is proposed utilizing the information from all of the network sensing paths. The proposed approach has been verified on a real structure during a Full Scale Fatigue Test (FSFT) ...|$|R
