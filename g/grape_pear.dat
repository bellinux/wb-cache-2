40|$|The {{method for}} {{separation}} and determination of several di- and tricarboxylic acids, including oxalic, malic, tartaric and citric acids (OX, MA, TA and CI), found in fruit juices by capillary zone electrophoresis with amperometric detection at a copper electrode was developed. Based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, the detection {{mechanism for the}} analytes at a copper electrode was {{proved to be the}} formation of complexes between di- and tricarboxylic acids and Cu(II) ion on the electrode surface. Separation was carried out in a pH 6. 2 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 0. 4 mmol/l cetylpridinium bromide (CPB) and 20 mmol/l &# 0946;-cyclodextrin (&# 0946;-CD) as an electro-osmotic flow (EOF) modifier to reverse the direction of the EOF and a complexing reagent for CPB to improve the separation, respectively. At the working potential of 0. 12 V (versus SCE), the calibration curves for the analytes were linear with about three orders of magnitude and the detection limits (S/N= 3) for them were between 4 and 8 fmol. By the method developed here, di- and tricarboxylic acids in four fruit juices, apple, <b>grape,</b> <b>pear</b> and orange juices, were successfully separated and determined...|$|E

DDE, dieldrin, aldrin, lindaneand α-HCH) and organophosphorus (malathio, parathion, methylparathion and diazinon) {{were determined}} in some fresh fruits (<b>grape,</b> <b>pear,</b> guava and fig) and vegetables (tomato, lettuce, parsley, garden rocket, green onion, green pepper, cucumber, celery and carrot) by using gas chromatography. The heavy metals of Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd and Zr as pollutants {{were also investigated}} in the same samples using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. These fresh samples were collected from full grand markets in Cairo, and the assaying was accomplished before and after washing by tap water. The {{results showed that the}} residues of malathion was detected in all tested samples, but other pesticide residues did not found in all samples. Heptachlore, hepatochlore epixide, DDT, DDD, DDE, diazinon and parathion were present in leels below the maximum recommended levels (MRLs) of FAO/WHO and Egyptian standards. But dieldrin, lindae, malathion and methylparathion were mostly detected in levels higher than the MRLs. The pollution by heavy metals was indicated in all tested samples, particularly by Fe (in vegetable) Pb, Cd and Zr which found in levels higher than given by Egyptian standards. However, the presence of Fe (in fruits), Cu and Zn were found in safe levels. The washing of fresh samples removed 8 - 88 % of pesticide residues and 5 - 55 % of heavy metals. The removal percentages by washing was affected by the initial levels of contaminant concentrations the type of pesticides and heavy metals and the type of fresh fruit and vegetables understudying...|$|E
40|$|To {{complete}} {{each phase}} of the growing season, plants must accumulate thermal time at lower base temperature (Tb). Little information exists on Tb variation between either fruit species or cultivars of the same species. We therefore aimed to determine the lower base temperature for contrasting genotypes in precocity of peach, plum, <b>grape,</b> <b>pear,</b> and kiwi. Twigs 25 - 35 cm long for the following cultivars: peach, Tropic Beauty (TB) and Eragil (ER); plum, Gulf Blaze (GB) and Letícia (LE); grape, Chardonnay (CH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS); pear, Smith (SM) and Packham’s (PA); and kiwi, Golden King (GK) and Hayward (HA) were collected in orchards in Veranópolis, RS Estate, on 06 / 13 / 2014, with 0 h at temperatures ? 7. 2 °C (chilling hours; HC) in the field. Intact twigs packed in black plastic film were subjected to 1, 008 HC at 0 °C in incubators to overcome dormancy and then transferred to temperatures of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 °C on single-node cuttings planted in phenolic foam to define effective heat temperature for the genotypes. Over 110 d, budburst of the buds was evaluated in 2 - 3 -d intervals in the green-tip stage. The resulting inverse data of number of days to budburst (1 /days to budburst) was inserted into regression curves to estimate Tb for each genotype. Historical phonological series comprised of 10 years for the analyzed cultivars and meteorological data of the cultivation sites {{were used to determine}} thermal time (degree-days) for the fruit trees during the growing season, considering different phenological phases. Temperate fruit species exhibited different Tb behaviors: Tb was lower for early cultivars (TB and GB = 2. 2 °C; CH = 2. 1 °C; SM = 4. 4 °C; GK = 4. 3 °C) and higher for late cultivars (ER = 6. 3 °C; LE = 6. 2 °C; CS = 4. 3 °C; HA and PA = 8. 2 °C) for all cultures. The Tb f fruit cultivars related directly with genotype chilling requirements: the higher the chilling requirement, the higher the Tb of the cultivar. Cultivars of the same fruit species yielded a sum of degree-days almost equal to finalize the growing season, regardless of the degree of precocity (TB = 1720; ER = 1801; GB = 1680; LE = 1718; CH = 2310; CS = 2369; SM = 2096; PA = 2003 GD; GK = 2775; HA = 2691). Regarding phenological phases, 82 % of the assessed cases responded more to thermal time (degree-days) than to chronological time (d) to complete phenological steps. Differences in Tb between genotypes are a relevant factor for improving the accuracy and applicability of phenology models in agriculture...|$|E

40|$|Pressure stabilities of polyphenoloxidases (PPO) from apples, avocados, <b>grapes,</b> <b>pears</b> and plums were {{determined}} at pH 6 - 7. These PPOs differed in pressure stability, but all were rather pressure-stable. Inactivation of PPO from apple, <b>grape,</b> avocado and <b>pear</b> {{at room temperature}} (25 degrees C) became noticeable at approximate to 600, 700, 800 and 900 MPa respectively, and followed first-order kinetics. Plum PPO was not inactivated at room temperature by pressures up to 900 MPa. Far the two most pressure-stable PPOs, we investigated whether pressure stability would be reduced by the simultaneous application of mild heat. In case of plum PPO, activity reduction was detectable at 900 MPa and 50 degrees C. Further temperature increase resulted in increase of the inactivation rate constant (E-a approximate to 63 kJ/mol). In case of pear PPO, temperature increase up to 35 degrees C resulted in a 3 -fold reduction of the inactivation rate constant.

Apple, pear and plum PPO {{appeared to have}} a molecular weight exceeding 750 kDa, which {{might be due to}} aggregation phenomena taking place during extraction. For avocado in addition to a large aggregate (MW > 750 kDa), two smaller PPO molecules with a MW of 58. 5 and 66. 5 kDa were detected. Plum PPO seemed to have at least two isoenzymes (pI 4. 8 and 5. 2). In the case of avocado PPO, pr values equalled 4. 6 and 4. 7. Thermal inactivation followed first-order decay for all PPOs studied. Except for apple and pear PPO, the relation between decimal reduction time and inactivation temperature was log-linear in the temperature domain studied. In the case of apple and pear PPO a 'breakpoint' wars noted at 72. 5 and 75 degrees C, respectively. Above and below these temperatures a log-linear relation between decimal reduction time and inactivation temperature was noted. Thermal resistance of PPO seemed to be dependent on its origin.
