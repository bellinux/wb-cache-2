25|$|Current {{estimates}} {{state that}} 2 million hospital patients {{are affected by}} adverse drug reactions every year and adverse drug events are the fourth leading cause of death. These adverse drug reactions result in an estimated economic cost of $136 billion per year.

Examples {{of ways in which}} genetics may affect an individual’s response to drugs include: drug transporters, metabolism and drug interactions. Pharmacogenetics may be used in the near future by public <b>health</b> <b>practitioners</b> to determine the best candidates for certain drugs, thereby reducing much of the guesswork in prescribing drugs. Such actions have the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse drug events.|$|E
