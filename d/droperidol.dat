25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926â€“2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds.

These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by sufentanil (1974), alfentanil (1976), carfentanil (1976), and lofentanil (1980). Janssen and his team also developed etomidate (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Droperidol,</b> haloperidol, {{or other}} typical {{antipsychotics}} can decrease {{the duration of}} agitation caused by acute psychosis, but should be avoided if the agitation is suspected to be akathisia, which can be potentially worsened.In those with psychosis causing agitation {{there is a lack}} of support for the use of benzodiazepines, although they can prevent side effects associated with dopamine antagonists.|$|E
50|$|NMS {{is usually}} caused by {{antipsychotic}} drug use, {{and a wide}} range of drugs can result in NMS.

50|$|In 1959, the {{combination}} of phenoperidine and haloperidol was first used in Europe in anesthesia to induce a detached, pain free state called Neuroleptic analgesia; {{the use of that}} mixture boomed in early 1960s but was overtaken by {{the combination}} of fentanyl and <b>droperidol,</b> which was widely used through the 1980s. These combination approaches were not adopted in the US.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{neuroleptic}} originates {{from the}} Greek word lepsis ("seizure" [...] or [...] "fit").

50|$|Discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961, <b>droperidol</b> is a {{butyrophenone}} {{which acts}} a potent D2 (dopamine receptor) antagonist with some histamine and serotonin antagonist activity. It has a central antiemetic action and effectively prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults using doses {{as low as}} 0.625 mg. It has also been used as an antipsychotic in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg given as an intramuscular injection, generally in cases of severe agitation in a psychotic patient who is refusing oral medication. Its use in intramuscular sedation {{has been replaced by}} intramuscular preparations of haloperidol, midazolam, clonazepam and olanzapine.

40|$|In 87 {{children}} aged 2 - 9 yr, oral <b>droperidol</b> and oral <b>droperidol</b> plus diazepam were compared as premedicants {{in a controlled}} double-blind clinical trial. Atropine was given orally to all the patients. <b>Droperidol</b> was well absorbed and produced good sedation, associated with a low incidence of vomiting after operation. <b>Droperidol</b> plus diazepam {{did not appear to}} offer any advantage over <b>droperidol</b> alone. Anxiety and extrapyramidal effects were not observed and may have been obviated by the addition of atropine. <b>Droperidol</b> syrup was noted to be more palatable than other oral premedicants in use. Although premedication with <b>droperidol</b> (Droleptan) i. m. has been used extensively, comparatively little is known of its efficacy when given orally. A previous trial of oral triclofos (trichloroethyl phosphate) and diazepam (Valium) in this hospital (Boyd and Manford, 1973) showed a high incidence of vomiting after operation. Trimeprazine (Vallergan) has been noted to cause prolonged recovery and drowsiness after anaesthesia and diazepam has a poor anti-salivary action. Both triclofos and trimeprazine may be unpalatable to children; the former because it is too sweet and the latter because of its bitter taste.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if emergency physicians' (EP) use <b>droperidol</b> {{has changed since}} the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning of December 2001 concerning QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden death; and to query EP opinions regarding <b>droperidol</b> {{before and after the}} FDA warning and regarding potential alternative drugs. Methods: An internet-based survey was designed with questions regarding <b>droperidol</b> use in the emergency department (ED). Data collected included EP demographics, use of <b>droperidol</b> before and after the FDA warning, use of alternative drugs, and incidence of arrhythmias. A representative sample of EPs were contacted by e-mail and asked to complete the survey. Results: A total of 2, 000 e-mails resulted in 506 (25 %) completed surveys. There was no second mailing. Responders' average years practicing was 12. 6 +_ 9. 2. EP responders worked in private/community (n= 278, 55 %), academic/county (n= 187, 37 %), and HMO (n= 41, 8 %) hospitals. The majority (n= 455, 90 %) used <b>droperidol</b> and were aware of the FDA warning (n= 460, 91 %). <b>Droperidol</b> was no longer available at 122 (24 %) of the respondents' EDs {{as a result of the}} FDA warning. Prior to the FDA warning, EPs who had used <b>droperidol</b> used it as an antiemetic (n= 408, 90 %), for control of agitation (n= 330, 73 %), for treatment of headache (n= 247, 54 %), and for treatment of vertigo (n= 106, 23 %). After the FDA warning, 387 (85 %) of EPs reported their use of <b>droperidol</b> had decreased or ceased altogether, and 68 (15 %) always obtained an electrocardiogram prior to administration. Of those who used <b>droperidol</b> for agitation, 137 (42 %) felt there were no other drugs with greater efficacy. Haloperidol was the most cited alternative agent (n= 160, 79 %) followed by benzodiazepines (n= 223, 68 %). Of those who used <b>droperidol</b> for antiemesis, 116 (28 %) felt there were no other drugs with greater efficacy than droperidol; promethazine was the most cited alternative agent (n= 26 O, 64 %). Two (0. 4 %) EPs reported arrhythmias in patients who received <b>droperidol.</b> Only 37 (8 %) EPs reported they were unconcerned with potential loss of <b>droperidol</b> from the market.

40|$|Background: <b>Droperidol</b> is {{commonly}} added to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) regimens as an antiemetic agent. Although {{some studies have}} demonstrated its safety and efficacy, {{it is not clear}} whether adding <b>droperidol</b> to IVPCA infusate without an extra loading dose can effectively reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in real-life clinical settings. Methods: Patients receiving IVPCA in this retrospective survey were classified into two groups based on their IVPCA regimens. The <b>droperidol</b> group used morphine 1 Â mg/mL with <b>droperidol</b> 50 Â Î¼g/mL, and the non-droperidol group was given morphine 1 Â mg/mL alone. The incidence and severity of PONV were compared between the two groups during the 3 -day course of IVPCA treatment using logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression. Propensity score methodology was applied to adjust for potential confounders. Results: Among the 186 patients enrolled, 94 patients received IVPCA with <b>droperidol,</b> and 92 patients received a pure morphine solution. There was no significant difference in patient attributes between the two groups. On the 1 st postoperative day, there was no significant difference in incidence or severity of PONV between the two groups. From the 2 nd day onward, the patients in the <b>droperidol</b> group had significantly fewer and less severe episodes of PONV (relative risk 0. 34 and 0. 31, respectively). The overall effects of <b>droperidol</b> on PONV and its severity during the whole IVPCA course were also statistically significant, whether or not adjustment for propensity score was made. However, although a statistically significant decrease in nausea was observed in the <b>droperidol</b> group after the 1 st day, no significant difference in the incidence of vomiting between the two groups was noted during the study. Conclusion: A loading dose should be considered on the 1 st postoperative day. Our study suggests just how beneficial <b>droperidol</b> can be to IVPCA users in practical clinical settings, showing that <b>droperidol</b> can reduce with some significance the amount and severity of nausea suffered by patients postoperatively, even if the frequency of patient vomiting remains unchanged...|$|E
