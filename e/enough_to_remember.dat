5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E
25|$|Whether a game {{is solved}} is not {{necessarily}} the same as whether it remains interesting for humans to play. Even a strongly solved game can still be interesting if its solution is too complex to be memorized; conversely, a weakly solved game may lose its attraction if the winning strategy is simple <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> (e.g. Maharajah and the Sepoys). An ultra-weak solution (e.g. Chomp or Hex on a sufficiently large board) generally does not affect playability.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the key drivers for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are that Kenya wishes to export surplus capital, Uganda seeks an outlet for its surplus labour, and Tanzania wants to realise a Pan-African vision. It has also been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper. Many of the {{national}} elites old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the former EAC often share memories and a sharp sense of loss at its eventual dissolution. More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest. Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.|$|E

50|$|Whilst {{the number}} of {{recorded}} pirate radio stations was in the hundreds, only a few have been notable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>remembered.</b> This is because at different stages, pirate stations were the mainstay of radio listenership, particularly in Dublin.|$|R
500|$|Author Ian Shaw called Nash [...] "perhaps the {{greatest}} all-round sportsman Australia has ever produced", while some fans old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> Nash at his peak list him as {{the greatest}} player they ever saw and a football journalist who failed to include Nash in a [...] "Best Ever" [...] list {{was the target of}} a letter writing campaign from elderly fans.|$|E
500|$|In one {{sequence}} where Bart imagines himself testifying in court, {{with his}} voice electronically altered. The altered voice {{was provided by}} American actor and television personality Steve Allen. Series creator Matt Groening {{said that he and}} some of the writers who were old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> Allen's TV show from the 1950s–60s were thrilled to have him guest-star, especially John Swartzwelder. It took nine takes for Allen to pronounce Bart's catchphrase [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] correctly, {{to the point where the}} staff began to get slightly frustrated with him. There was a discussion amongst the writing team of whether the episode should end with a joke or have a [...] "sweet" [...] ending. Reiss said [...] "With the better angels in our nature, we went with the sweet ending [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|According to the BBC, while {{divisions}} and resentment exist between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the UK, particularly amongst those old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> atrocities committed in Cyprus, [...] "if {{differences of opinion}} exist, both sides have learnt to live together regardless". Community relations are generally good, with Turkish Cypriot community centres welcoming Greek Cypriots and vice versa. In oral history interviews conducted by academic Nergis Canefe in the late 1990s, Turkish Cypriots in London tended to define themselves as Anglo-Cypriot, particularly if they {{were born in the}} UK. Canefe notes that her interviewees were proud to be Cypriot, but also of being British and not Turkish. They had Turkish friends, but also close Greek and Greek Cypriot friends. The neighbourhoods they inhabited tended to be ethnically mixed, and often shared with Greeks and Greek Cypriots.|$|E

Suppose a mishap, Gillian-—how would you feel as to your treatment of him on this last evening?" ...|$|R
500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all we care about accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that [...] "We Are the World" [...] had [...] "stood the test of time"; anyone old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it can still at least hum along.|$|E
2500|$|If Eilmer {{had seen}} Halley's comet seventy-six years earlier in 989, {{he could have}} been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it. However the {{periodicity}} of comets was probably unknown in Eilmer's time, and so his remark [...] "It is long since I saw you" [...] could have referred to a different, later comet. Since it is known that Eilmer was an [...] "old man" [...] in 1066, and that he had made the flight attempt [...] "in his youth", the event is placed some time during the early 11th century, perhaps in its first decade.|$|E

60|$|So {{the king}} sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, {{and before long}} the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about {{a half an hour}} they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They both got {{powerful}} mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> forget <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.|$|R
50|$|In statistics, the Tukey-Duckworth test is a two-sample {{location}} test - {{a statistical}} test of whether {{one of two}} samples was significantly greater than the other. It was introduced by John Tukey, who aimed to answer a request by W. E. Duckworth for a test simple <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> and applied in the field without recourse to tables, let alone computers.|$|R

50|$|However, he had {{not been}} lucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> and {{mentioned}} before parliament, and he was arrested for travelling into England without a license not long after landing at Eastbourne. Travelling without a licence was high treason, and so Boucher was tried at the Queen's Bench in early 1704 where he pleaded guilty. On the 28th of February he was sentenced, and taken to Tyburn where he was hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|R

60|$|Anne Catherick again! Even {{the memory}} of the {{farewell}} evening with my mother and my sister could not return to me now unconnected with that other memory of the moonlight walk back to London. What did it mean? Were that woman and I to meet once more? It was possible, at the least. Did she know that I lived in London? Yes; I had told her so, either before or after that strange question of hers, when she had asked me so distrustfully if I knew many men of the rank of Baronet. Either before or after--my mind was not calm <b>enough,</b> then, <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> which.|$|R

50|$|What this {{procedure}} does, as explained above for most divisibility rules, is simply subtract {{little by little}} multiples of 7 from the original number until reaching a number that is small <b>enough</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{whether it is a}} multiple of 7. If 1 becomes a 3 in the following decimal position, that is just the same as converting 10×10n into a 3×10n.
