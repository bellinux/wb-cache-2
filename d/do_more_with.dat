5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E

On February 5, 2014, Twitter published its first results as a public company, showing a net loss of $511 million {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2013. On January 5, 2016, CEO Jack Dorsey commented on a report that Twitter planned to expand its character limit to 10,000 (private messages already had the longer limit as of July), requiring users to click to see anything beyond 140 characters.

Khan was represented as a Nordic criminal with a [...] "magnificent" [...] body, Harald Ericsson. The producers suggested changes to the outline {{in a series of}} memos; in memos dated September 7 and 9, Coon suggested significant changes to Ericsson. [...] "I want to rather <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> him than you have indicated in the story outline,” he wrote. Believing that Ericsson (misspelled as Erickson in the memo) could be a worthy adversary for Kirk, Coon suggested that the character be “in fact very similar to James Kirk, our captain, except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture [...] In other words, Carey, build us a giant of a man." ...|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Jon Osterman / Doctor Manhattan: A superpowered {{being who}} is {{contracted}} by the United States government. Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over matter {{when he was}} caught in an [...] "Intrinsic Field Subtractor" [...] in 1959. Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton's Captain Atom, who in Moore's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat. However, the writer found he could <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> Manhattan as a [...] "kind of a quantum super-hero" [...] than he could have with Captain Atom. In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum physics in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from Star Trek, so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain [...] "human habits" [...] and to grow away from them and humanity in general. Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper, and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles white skin tonally, but has a different hue. Moore incorporated the color into the story, and Gibbons noted {{the rest of the}} comic's color scheme made Manhattan unique. Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character. Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan's nudity, selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him [...] "understated" [...] genitals—like a classical sculpture—so the reader would not initially notice it.|$|E

40|$|Background Marketing {{spending}} has grown {{dramatically over the}} last decade but the traditional market-ing strategies such as advertising in TV, on billboards and posters might not be as effective as they used to be. The phenomena, how to work with marketing with the use of limited capital, has attracted attention in different contexts lately. It may sound hopeless to reach all the way through by the use of limited capital but it although exist examples of compa-nies that have succeeded with this; they are <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> less. Purpose The main purpose of this thesis is to examine how firms, by the use of no or limited finan-cial resources, could market themselves successfully and how such a marketing process look like. The other purpose is to identify or map out the difference among traditional marketing and <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> less. Method <b>With</b> a <b>more</b> inductive research approach and a qualitative research method the data was collected for this thesis. Four companies were carefully selected and interviewed over the phone. The chosen respondents are; Tomas Gustafsson representing Brämhults, Per Holk-nekt at Odd Molly, Jan Gustafsson at Saltå Kvarn and Hanna Lundgren at WeSC. Conclusion We have concluded that many strategies can be successful in <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> less. The strategies found in this study are; Public Relations, Brand Management, Packaging, Product Placement, Event Marketing and Unique Selling Propositions. A coherent pattern or proc-ess could not be identified but it exist similarities in the way that companies make use of marketing strategies concerning <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> <b>with</b> less. Moreover we came up with the con-clusion that the difference between traditional marketing and the strategies identified as do-ing <b>more</b> <b>with</b> less, besides the obvious cost aspect, is the connection that they are often presented in a way which is not as easy for the potential consumer to perceive as commer-cial...|$|R

In The Young Unicorns Dave at one point says that Emily is the only person in the world that he loves, but his feeling toward her is that of a brother, not a romantic love. At the time of his encounter with the Austins, Dave has left the St. Andrews School and changed to a trade school where he studies electronics, because learning a trade is the [...] "pragmatic" [...] choice for him.
