However, building functions are easily neglected {{in the process of}} low carbon <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> construction. Therefore, based on the concept of value engineering, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate carbon emissions of <b>residential</b> <b>building.</b> It highlights <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> functions as well. Function coefficient can be confirmed by establishing <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> function evaluation index system. Moreover, the unit carbon emission isadopted as cost coefficient. The low-carbon nature of <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> will be evaluated by the ratio of function coefficient and cost coefficient. The aim of this research is to advance the awareness of <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> carbon emissions, exploring the path of realizing maximum satisfaction of building functions with minimum carbon emissions, which can provide new ideas of <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> carbon emissions evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Recently, an {{increasing}} number of green <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> have been developed worldwide owing to active promotion from the authorities and increasing interest from customers. However, {{in the same way as}} traditional <b>residential</b> <b>buildings,</b> the construction of green <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> faces various risks. The aims of this study are to identify and assess the diverse risks in green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> construction projects, compare their risk criticalities with those in traditional counterparts, and propose helpful risk mitigation measures. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted, and a questionnaire was then administered to 30 construction companies in Singapore. Survey results showed that “complex procedures to obtain approvals”, “overlooked high initial cost”, “unclear requirements of owners”, “employment constraint”, and “lack of availability of green materials and equipment” were the top five critical risks in green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> construction projects. Survey results also showed that green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> projects were facing risks at a more critical level than those traditional <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> projects. Additionally, this study proposed fourteen risk mitigation measures to tackle the risks in green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> construction projects. This study has contributed to the body of knowledge by identifying and evaluating the critical risks and mitigation measures in green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> construction projects. Meanwhile, the findings from this study can also provide an in-depth understanding of risk management in green <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> construction projects to practitioners and thus benefit the practice...|$|R

This paper explores the potential energy savings and reduction in CO 2 emissions offered by <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> energy efficiency policies and plans in South Korea. The current and future energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> were estimated using an energy–environment model from 2010 to 2030.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the air {{pressure}} variations in an in-use drainage stack of high-rise <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> with the probable influence of occupant loads. Design/methodology/approach - The air pressure variations in a drainage stack of a typical in-use high-rise <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> in Hong Kong were correlated to the number of water closet (WC) flushes of the building. In particular, measured diurnal WC flushing patterns of the <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> were used to correlate the diurnal pressure variations measured at 16 m above the stack base in a 115 m high, 150 mm diameter fully vented drainage stack of a typical high-rise <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> of Hong Kong.
