5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal <b>examiner</b> provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal <b>examiner</b> registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not know anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph <b>examiner</b> who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the <b>examiner</b> felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Examiners</b> {{have existed}} since {{approximately}} 1315, when {{the position of}} Clerk of the Parliaments was established during the Edward II [...] The Clerk was nominated by the King {{to serve as a}} [...] "special deputy" [...] and tasked with reading out the titles of bills and the responses from Parliament. The Clerk convened a group of legal experts, <b>Examiners,</b> to assist him with these tasks. The Clerk of the Parliaments Act 1824 defined the <b>Examiners</b> duties {{for the first time in}} statute, and the Act is still in force and binding on current <b>Examiners.</b> Formally, <b>Examiners</b> only receive a wage of 12 shillings a year.|$|R

5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an <b>examiner,</b> who acted in the Baron's name. The office of <b>examiner</b> was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an <b>examiner,</b> each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{degree of}} error in {{subjective}} estimation of breast implant volume remains unknown. Methods: Nine silicone breast implants {{were used by}} 16 <b>examiners</b> for subjective, blinded, implant volume estimation. The figures on the stamps were taken as the true breast implant volumes for comparison. The <b>examiners</b> {{were divided into two}} groups of equal size: experienced <b>examiners</b> (consultant breast surgeons) and unexperienced <b>examiners</b> (trainees). Fourteen <b>examiners</b> repeated the tests after about 2 weeks. Results: In both groups of doctors, the implant volumes were underestimated by a mean ± standard deviation of 61. 6 ± 58. 1 cc (21. 9 % ± 20. 1 %) in the first test and 37. 9 ± 59. 1 cc (13. 6 % ± 20. 7 %) in the second test. The absolute deviation independent of volume overestimation or underestimation was 77. 3 ± 36. 9 cc (27. 2 % ± 12. 8 %) in the first test and 58. 1 ± 41. 3 cc (20. 6 % ± 14. 6 %) in the second test. In terms of absolute figures, the experienced <b>examiners</b> showed significantly better results than did the unexperienced <b>examiners</b> during the first test. The unexperienced <b>examiners</b> showed increasing deviations with increasing implant volumes. The degree of estimation error was lower in the second test. Conclusions: These blinded subjective estimations of breast implant volume exhibited limited accuracy and reproducibility. Estimation errors were quantified and increased with increasing implant volumes. Experienced <b>examiners</b> performed considerably better than unexperienced <b>examiners,</b> and results of the second test were better in both groups. The subjective volume estimations deviated from the true volumes by around 70 cc (underestimated by around 50 cc). Level of evidence: Level II...|$|R
