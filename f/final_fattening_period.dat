40|$|Human health depends to a {{great extent}} on the quality of {{consumed}} food. The relationship between the diet and health is increasingly evident. Therefore, the exact food composition, as well as the possibilities of its improvement, is intensively investigated. Turkey pectoral muscle is often recommended today as the most healthy meat product. The aim of our study was to improve the pectoral fat content of turkeys by adding some extra fat sources to their meals. The study was performed on 90 female turkeys of the hybrid Nicholas 700, in their <b>final</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> (from 15 th to 19 th week of age). Turkeys were divided into three groups, each represented by 30 individuals, and fed with meals differing in fat source, in the amount of 3 % of the total meal weight. The added fat in the first group came from the commercial preparation Bergafat. Pronova Biocare Epax 3000 TG was added to the food of second group, while the third group had rapeseed oil added. After the fattening period, the quality of pectoral muscle was determined for the 10 carcasses from each experimental group (water holding capacity - WHC, meat color, protein, fat, ash, water, cholesterol and fatty acids content). Meat color did not differ between the investigated groups, while WHC statistically differed (P< 0. 05). Turkey muscles in the first group had the best WHC (7. 76 cm 2), while the the second group had the worst (9. 12 cm 2). No difference could be shown in the turkey muscle protein, water and ash content between the experimental groups. However, the second experimental group had a lower total lipid content (1. 73 %, P< 0. 05) compared to the first (1. 97 %) and third (1. 93 %). Turkeys from the first and second groups had lower cholesterol concentration in the pectoral muscle lipids (21. 74 and 18. 04 mg/ 100 g, respectively, P< 0. 05) compared to the third group (41. 00 mg/ 100 g). The second experimental group had the highest PUFA content (P< 0. 001) and lowest n- 6 /n- 3 ratio (P< 0. 001) compared to the other experimental groups. We concluded that the most favourable effects on the lipid status of turkey pectoral muscle was observed with the Pronova preparation, which lowered its total lipid and cholesterol concentration, raised PUFA content, and lowered the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio. Further investigations, including combinations of added oils to the diet, should be directed to minimize the observed undesirable effects of Pronova preparation on turkey meat quality characteristics...|$|E

Three thousand and three hundred coho salmons were randomly assigned to three diets with two repetitions each. The fishes of the first group were fed a diet with 45 % of protein and 22 % of lipids (P/L 2. 04) (control). The second group received a diet with 43 % protein 26 % lipids diet (P/L 1. 65), and the third group a diet with 40 % protein 30 % lipids diet (P/L 1. 33). The productive performance was evaluated taking into account the feed consumption, weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, specific growth rate and average final weight. The characteristics quality were evaluated considering body length, condition factor, eviscerated weight, carcass yield, viscera weight, liver weight, gonad weights, perivisceral fat and belly thickness. The productive performance results were similar between all treatments except the average weight. This value was higher in the treatments with lower P/L ratios (p< 0. 05); diet 1 : 3911 g; diet 2 : 4179 g and diet 3 : 4078 g and males (4237 g) were heavier (p< 0. 05) than females (3840 g). In general, the better carcass characteristics in fish were obtained by fishes fed diet 2 compared with those fed diet 1 but with fishes fed diet 3, and males had a better performance than females. Diets with more fat produced greater perivisceral fat content however the carcass yield was not affected. The diet 2 ($ 675) turned out to be of a greater cost for each kg gained than the diet 1 ($ 627) and diet 3 ($ 625). The final decision of feeding a diet with a higher lipid content has to be based on a better feed conversion efficiency and that the substitution of an ingredient, such as fish meal, should be a diet of a lower price, that was not observed in this assay...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at six candidate genes (LEP, CAST, CAPN 1, GHR, FABP 4 and DGAT 1) on fattening performance and carcass traits of Simmental bulls in Turkey. The analysis covered a total of 81  Simmental bulls grown on a private farm that were randomly selected for their <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> for use in this study. Genotyping was performed using the PCR-RFLP method. The S 20 T polymorphism at the CAST gene and the G 316 A polymorphism at the CAPN 1 gene were associated with variation in <b>final</b> weight, <b>fattening</b> <b>period,</b> weight gain and average daily gain (P  <  0. 05). In addition, LEP A 80 V had a significant effect on hot and chilled carcass weight and dressing percentage (P  <  0. 05). There was no association between GHR S 555 G, FABP 4 V 110 M and DGAT 1 K 232 A markers with the traits analysed.

40|$|The {{technology}} for intensive broiler breeding using deep litter method provides convenient conditions for production of odour substances inside the barn. As a consequence, there are relatively high odour {{emissions in the}} breeding area and its surrounding, which has significant impacts on the life quality of both people and animals. The amount of produced emissions increases in time because it {{is closely related to}} the amount of poultry droppings accumulated in litter inside the barn. This paper deals with changes in odour intensity depending on time measured since the beginning of broiler fattening. Odour intensity was measured by methods of dynamic olfactometry. The estimated values gradually increased from 45 ouE·m- 3 to the highest value of 259 ouE·m- 3, which was determined in the <b>final</b> <b>fattening</b> phase (broilers’ age 33 days). The calculated odour substances emission values were in range from 0. 02 ouE·s- 1 ·bird- 1 at the beginning of fattening up to 0. 10 ouE·s- 1 ·bird- 1 in the <b>final</b> <b>fattening</b> phase.

40|$|Selection for leaner {{types of}} pigs is {{associated}} with a more sustained daily lean tissue growth and consequently with an increase in the daily lysine requirement. Accordingly, the lysine / energy ratio should be constant for the whole <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> between 35 and r 20 kg live weight. Similar final carcass characteristics, i. e. the same amount of deposited protein, at a given slaughter weight, may be obtained by distinct energy levels and lysine /energy ratios. For the limiting amino acid (lysine) the lysine /energy ratio was 2. o g /Mcal D. E. and, taking into account amino acid digestibility, 1. 8 g dig. lysine/Mcal D. ha. To optimize energy and protein (lysine) allowances for a given slaughter weight the energy level and profile should be adjusted to the <b>final</b> <b>fattening</b> weight. This is of great importance for producing heavy pigs as compared to lighter ones. Very high energy consumption in the fattening stage of 35 to 70 kg resulted in a decline of weight and protein deposition {{at the end of the}} <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> from about go kg live weight onwards. It cannot be compensated for by a high protein supplementation. At a finishing weight of r 20 kg a too intensive nutrient level (more than 650 g gain /day) at the first fattening stage proved to be unfavourable. The resulting depression of protein deposition in the second <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> accounts for an insufficient expression of the muscle growth potential. It is defined as the upper limit of protein deposition (and consequently lean meat production) in a fattening animal at a given final weight for minimizing both the fattening length and fat depo-sition. When producing heavy pigs, a reduction of energy supply during the second half of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> is not advisable when using modern crossbred lean pigs. On the contrary, all efforts should be made so that the energy intake during the second half of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> is not limiting for lean tissue growth...|$|R

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end of <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their fattening process.

In intensive lamb production systems, the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> starts after a relative short suckling period, and lambs are fed a high concentrate diet. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of supplementing SB in the concentrate on rumen development and productive performance of lambs during the suckling and the <b>fattening</b> <b>periods.</b> During suckling, 66 lambs were distributed with their mothers in four pens. Treatments were: control concentrate (CON), and concentrate supplemented with 3. 6 g of SB/kg of DM (SBC). At weaning, nine lambs were slaughtered for sample collection, and 47 lambs were distributed into 12 pens for the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Treatments were: (1) CON?CON for lambs fed CON in both periods; (2) CON?SBC for lambs fed CON in the suckling and SBC in the fattening period; (3) SBC?CON for lambs fed SBC in the suckling and CON in the fattening period; and (4) SBC?SBC for lambs fed SBC in both periods. At 88 days of age all lambs were slaughtered. In both periods, concentrate dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), body weight (BW), hot carcass weight (HCW), dressing percentage (DP), reticulum-rumen weight (RRW), rumen fluid pH, and density, length, width and keratinization of rumen papillae were measured. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated for the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> During the suckling period, SBC lambs had higher DMI, ADG, HCW and DP (P < 0. 05), and tended to have higher rumen papillae length and lower RRW (P < 0. 10).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe organic steer production on farm level. Six Danish organic farms were part of the registration program including 3 dairy farmers and 3 crop farmers buying dairy breed bull calves from organic dairy farmers. All farmers had a steer production, some of them were recently started and some had an established steer production. The experiment endured 2 years from January 2000 to April 2002. Registrations included liveweight, feed consumption, welfare and slaughter results with special emphasis on the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Welfare registrations were based on a scheme describing the system as well as the animal during winter when stabled in the barn and during summer on pasture. Registrations were measured on the system as well on the animals. Daily gain on pasture varied from 533 to 823 g and covers grazing on ryegrass/clover pastures as well as marginal grazing areas. On most of the farms steers grazed both kind of pastures. Gains during the stable period varied from 562 to 867 g/day between the farms. Feed consumption per steer per year was 1770 SFU ± 186 based on 4 farms. Feed consumption in summer accounted 0. 47 to 0. 57 of total feed consumption (DM) per year. Pasture accounts for 0. 22 to 0. 56 and concentrates for 0. 16 to 0. 37 of the total dry matter (DM) consumption per year. Management strategies concerning the fattening of steers were different between the 6 farms, as liveweight (458 - 595 kg) and age (20 - 25 months) at start of fattening and at slaughter (565 - 667 kg and 23 - 28 months) and length of <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> (2. 3 - 3. 4 months) varied. Feeding during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> was based on 1. 3 to 4. 7 Scandinavian Feed Units (SFU) concentrates per steer per day and silage ad libitum. The total amount of cereals consumed in the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> was 100 - 357 kg/steer. Only few steers were fattened on pasture. It seemed that whole crop silage is preferred to grass silage in the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Slaughter results show a variation between farms in slaughter percentage from 49. 4 to 53. 8, carcass conformation from 3. 5 to 4. 9 and fatness from 2. 5 to 3. 2. Liveweight at slaughter was the only variable with general effect on carcass conformation on 5 farms (0. 6 point on the EUROP-scale with increase in 100 kg liveweight at slaughter). The welfare registration scheme indicates good conditions both in the barn and on pasture, low disease rate and minor problems concerning welfare aspects in organic steer production. It is concluded that great variation between farms concerning management strategies shows the possibilities for improving the production system. Fattening strategy should focus on liveweight at slaughter.

Eighty eight rabbits, identified at weaning (28 d) with a glass-encapsulated transponder, were randomly selected at 56 d of age from two groups of rabbits fed a moderate (33 % NDF) or a high (41 % NDF) insoluble fibre diet. Within treatment, half rabbits were fed an experimental diet containing a very high concentration of NDF (49 %) from defatted grape seed meal and the remaining animals continued receiving the same diet than before up to 63 d of age. Without fasting, rabbits were carried to a slaughterhouse and processed following standard techniques. Rabbits fed a high fibrous diet in the last week of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> (56 - 63 d) maintained their growth rate when NDF dietary level increased from high commercial levels (41 %) up to near 50 %. However, when this diet was fed to rabbits following a moderate NDF (33 %) diet in the growing period, feed intake increased greatly, but not enough to maintain growth rate. Dietary treatments did not significantly influence live weight before and after transport. Full gastrointestinal weight decreased by feeding the highest fibrous diet (49 % NDF) in the last week of the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> if a high fibre diet (41 % NDF) was also fed in the growing period, but th...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to Figure out the effect of egg weight on hatching rate and fattening performance of partridges (A. Chuka r) reared under intensive conditions. The eggs were divided into two groups as big (=>? 20 g) and small (< 20 g), then incubated. Hatching rate for big and small groups were 75, 8 and 74. 1 %, respectively. Hatching weight for big and small groups were 14, 30, 16 and 13, 20, 16 g, respectively. All the chicks were fattened till 16 weeks of age. At the end of <b>fattening</b> <b>period,</b> average live weight of male and female partridges were 5099 and 49512 g for big and 42514 and 4219 g for small groups, respectively. Males had higher live weight than females (p< 0. 001). Egg weight affected live weight of the partridges at 2 - 4, 8 - 10 and 12 - 14 weeks of age (p< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in terms of feed consumption through <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> Total feed consuming for big and small groups were 2200. 7125. 3 and 2059, 436, 08 g, respectively.

40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is the obligate {{infectious}} agent in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) of pigs. To control PMWS, we vaccinated dams at 4 and 2 weeks before pregnancy {{and again in}} the 12 th week of gestation with an inactivated PCV 2 vaccine (Circovac). Two producer farms run under the control of Swiss Swine Health Organization were selected for the experiment. Previously, in one farm PMWS was diagnosed on pigs after weaning, whereas in the other farm, pigs wasted during the <b>fattening</b> <b>period.</b> For the experiments 113 dams were randomly vaccinated, and 111 dams were sham injected. Vaccination increased serum antibodies in dams 3 - to 9 -fold, accompanied by serum antibody titer increases in their offspring. In the sixth week of life, progeny from vaccinated dams had about the same IgG antibody titers as progeny of unvaccinated dams at the third day of life. In sera of vaccinated dams only low concentrations of PCV 2 DNA were detected, and no progeny developed PMWS. Interestingly, at day 56 four progeny of unvaccinated dams tested positive for anti-PCV 2 IgM antibodies, indicating a primary infection with PCV 2. Of economic importance is the observation that progeny of vaccinated dams had a significantly higher daily weight gain in the <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> (farm X, + 51 g/day; farm Y, + 30 g/day) and thus a shortened <b>fattening</b> <b>period</b> of about 6 days compared to progeny of controls.
