However, P. d. indicus-group and P. d. domesticus-group birds intergrade in a large part of Iran, so this split is rarely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses its food source and dies as well.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies encounter a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because the P. rebeli caterpillars have a lower social rank in other ant species compared to their social rank in the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, when some of the hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy {{a series of}} electron shells (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists {{of one or more}} subshells (named s, p, d, f and g). As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The {{electron configuration}} for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell—two in the s subshell and six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>p</b> subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.|$|E

25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>P</b> site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>P</b> site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the river sediment transport characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Ping</b> River basin, {{which is one of}} the major river basins in Thailand. River surveys of <b>the</b> <b>Ping</b> River were carried out nine times between 2011 and 2013. Survey data included river cross sections, flow velocities, suspended sediment concentration, and bed load transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river. Analyzes of these data indicated that suspended transport rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ping</b> River during normal flow conditions in 2012 - 2013 ranged between 107 and 9, 562 metric tons/day (mt/d), but increased to 35, 300 mt/d during high flooding conditions (Thailand's Great Flood of 2011). The rate of bed load transport was 1, 401 mt/d during the Flood of 2011. However, the measured bed load in 2012 - 2013 varied between 0 and 482 mt/d. The bed-to-suspended load ratio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ping</b> River fluctuated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> broad range of 0 - 2. 0. Estimates of total sediment transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ping</b> River were made using some of the classic equations from the hydrologic literature.

25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>p</b> and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E
25|$|The entire genomes of the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana (32.4 Mb), and the pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (27.4 Mb), {{have been}} sequenced. Comparisons {{of the two}} fully sequenced diatom genomes finds that the P. tricornutum genome {{includes}} fewer genes (10,402 opposed to 11,776) than T. pseudonana and no major synteny (gene order) could be detected between the two genomes. T. pseudonana genes show an average of ~1.52 introns per gene as opposed to 0.79 in P. tricornutum, suggesting recent widespread intron gain in the centric diatom. Despite relatively recent evolutionary divergence (90 million years), the extent of molecular divergence between centrics and pennates indicates rapid evolutionary rates within the Bacillariophyceae compared to other eukaryotic groups. Comparative genomics also established that a specific class of transposable elements, the Diatom Copia-like retrotransposons (or CoDis), has been significantly amplified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> tricornutum genome with respect to T. pseudonana, constituting 5.8 and 1% of the respective genomes.|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} a 10 -year cross {{sectional}} analysis of human factors in U. S. military UAV mishaps. Methods: Class A-C UAV mishap reports were reviewed and human factors coded using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). HFACS codes were linked to human systems integration (HSI) domains. Binary logistic regression was used to create models predicting operator error. Results: 133 / 221 (60. 2 %) UAV mishaps involved human factors. Predictors of operator error were technological environment and cognitive factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Air Force (<b>P</b> < 0. 010), organizational process, psycho-behavioral factors, and crew resource management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Army (<b>P</b> < 0. 001), and organizational process, inadequate supervision, planned inappropriate operations, physical and technological environments, and cognitive and psycho-behavioral factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy (<b>P</b> < 0. 025).

The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950.

Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E
