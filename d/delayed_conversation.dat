40|$|The {{wireless}} {{networks have}} been built with versatile wireless network technology, including both wide area wireless networks and local area wireless networks. In such heterogeneous network environment, mobile users may experience either short or long interruption for different reasons while having a multimedia conversation. A lot of emphasis is concentrated on improving radio signal and enhancing seamless handover. However, recovery and backup multimedia conversation from a temporary network failure is also an interesting topic to be discussed. In this thesis, a SIP-based communication with enabling of disruption tolerance mechanism is introduced. We present the idea of media stream and SIP signaling based detection and recovery mechanisms, and come with an implementation of the prototype. The disruption tolerance functions include the ways of detecting network failure, storing the conversation during the meanwhile of the network disconnection, recover the previous broken multimedia session and replay the unheard voice. A brief experimental SIP network is built to evaluate the disruption tolerance functions of the software prototype. The result of the experimentation shows that the multimedia session can be recovered from the broken session in a short time, and the important conversation will not be lost during the short network disconnection. The replayed voice brings a delay to the recovered conversation which is not good experience for the users. However, the <b>delayed</b> <b>conversation</b> {{is much better than}} losing the conversation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Conversations about {{end-of-life}} care remain challenging {{for health care}} providers. The tendency to <b>delay</b> <b>conversations</b> about care options represents a barrier that impedes the ability of terminally-ill patients to participate in decision-making. Family physicians with a palliative care practice are often responsible for discussing {{end-of-life care}} preferences with patients, {{yet there is a}} paucity of research directly observing these interactions. In this study, we sought to explore how patients and family physicians initiated decision-making conversations {{in the context of a}} community hospital-based palliative care service. Methods: This qualitative study combined discourse analysis with ethnographic methods. The field research lasted one year, and data were generated through participant observation and audio-recordings of consultations. A total of 101 consultations were observed longitudinally between 18 patients, 6 family physicians and 2 pivot nurses. Data analysis consisted in exploring the different types of discourses initiating decision-making conversations and how these discourses were affected by the organizational context in which they took place. Results: The organization of care had an impact on decision-making conversations. The timing and origin of referrals to palliative care shaped whether patients were still able to participate in decision-making, and the decisions that remained to be made. The type of decisions to be made also shaped how conversations were initiated. Family physicians introduced decision-making conversations about issues needing immediate attention...|$|R

40|$|In conversation, {{negative}} {{responses to}} invitations, requests, offers {{and the like}} more often occur with a <b>delay</b> – <b>conversation</b> analysts talk of them as dispreferred. Here we examine the contrastive cognitive load ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses make, either when given relatively fast (300 ms) or delayed (1000 ms). Participants heard minidialogues, with turns extracted from a spoken corpus, while having their EEG recorded. We find that a fast ‘no’ evokes an N 400 -effect relative to a fast ‘yes’, however this contrast is not present for delayed responses. This shows that an immediate response {{is expected to be}} positive – but this expectation disappears as the response time lengthens because now in ordinary conversation the probability of a ‘no’ has increased. Additionally, however, 'No' responses elicit a late frontal positivity both when they are fast and when they are delayed. Thus, regardless of the latency of response, a ‘no’ response is associated with a late positivity, since a negative response is always dispreferred and may require an account. Together these results show that negative responses to social actions exact a higher cognitive load, but especially when least expected, as an immediate response...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{government}} and private entities {{around the world have}} banned mobile phone usage in public and private places. Bystanders complain about mobile phone conversations and find them extremely annoying and intrusive. The question here is: 2 ̆ 2 Why do we find them so annoying? 2 ̆ 2 Previous research in this area has shown that loudness and hearing only one side of the conversation are contributing factors; other work has compared mobile phone conversations to face-to-face conversations and found {{that the majority of the}} subjects tested find the mobile phone conversations more annoying. No one so far has been able to show that these factors provide the full explanation. ^ This thesis takes a look at the technological aspect of mobile phone conversations. When talking on a mobile phone, the audio signal, i. e. your voice, goes through several changes before it is transmitted across the network. The analog audio signal is taken from the microphone and using a codec it is converted into a signal that is optimized for transmission. During this process certain amount of time is consumed by the encoding process and the audio quality is lowered because the signal is compressed. ^ My hypotheses are that the increased delay and lowered audio quality induced by a codec causes annoyance not only to talkers, but also to bystanders. I have devised two experiments, one for testing the effects of increased delay on bystanders and one for the effects of lowered audio quality. Using a software simulator that I built, I was able to inject <b>delay</b> into <b>conversations</b> and test the first hypothesis. For the audio quality experiment I used Citizen 2 ̆ 7 s Band walkie-talkies at different distances to test the second hypothesis. My results show that increased delay and lowered audio quality do affect bystanders in a negative way. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the whole process}} of building up a high precision, high dynamical MEMS acceleration sensor. The first samples have achieved a resolution of better than 500 g and a bandwidth of more than 200 Hz. The sensor fabrication technology is shortly covered in the paper. A theoretical model is built from the physical principles of the complete sensor system, consisting of the MEMS sensor, the charge amplifier and the PWM driver for the sensor element. The mathematical modeling also covers problems during startup. A reduced order model of the entire system is used to design a robust control with the Mixed-Sensitivity H-Approach. Since the system has an unstable pole, imposed by the electrostatic field and time delay, caused by A/D-D/A <b>conversation</b> <b>delay</b> and DSP computing time, limitations for the control design are given. The theoretical model might be inaccurate or lacks of completeness, because the parameters for the theoretical model building vary from sampl e to sample or might be not known. A new identification scheme for open or closed-loop operation is deployed to obtain directly from the samples the parameters of the mechanical system and the voltage dependent gains. The focus of this paper is the complete system development and identification process including practical tests in a DSP TI-TMS 320 C 3000 environment...|$|R

(Scenes of the astronauts in the Discovery pod bay, along with earlier scenes involving shuttle flight attendants, depict walking in zero-gravity with the help of velcro-equipped shoes labeled [...] "Grip Shoes"). Other aspects that contribute to the film's realism are the depiction of the time <b>delay</b> in <b>conversations</b> between the astronauts and Earth due to the extreme distance between the two (which the BBC announcer explains have been edited out of the broadcast), the attention to small details such as the sound of breathing inside the spacesuits, the conflicting spatial orientation of astronauts inside a zero-gravity spaceship, and the enormous size of Jupiter in relation to the spaceship.The general approach to how space travel is engineered is highly accurate; in particular, the design of the ships was based on actual engineering considerations rather than attempts to look aesthetically [...] "futuristic". Many other science-fiction films give spacecraft an aerodynamic shape, which is superfluous in outer space (except for craft such as the Pan Am shuttle that are designed to function both in atmosphere and in space). Kubrick's science advisor, Frederick Ordway, notes that in designing the spacecraft [...] "We insisted on knowing the purpose and functioning of each assembly and component, down to the logical labeling of individual buttons and the presentation on screens of plausible operating, diagnostic and other data." [...] Onboard equipment and panels on various spacecraft have specific purposes such as alarm, communications, condition display, docking, diagnostic, and navigation, the designs of which relied heavily on NASA's input. Aerospace specialists were also consulted on the design of the spacesuits and space helmets. The space dock at Moon base Clavius shows multiple underground layers which could sustain high levels of air pressure typical of Earth. The lunar craft design takes into account the lower gravity and lighting conditions on the Moon. The Jupiter-bound Discovery is meant to be powered by a nuclear reactor at its rear, separated from the crew area at the front by hundreds of feet of fuel storage compartments. Although difficult to be recognized as such, actual nuclear reactor control panel displays appear in the astronaut's control area.|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties that}} listeners may rely on {{in both the}} production and perception of ethnolinguistic variation are an important yet poorly understood topic in modern sociolinguistics. Though several studies (Purnell, Idsardi and Baugh 1999, Tarone 1973, Walton and Orlikoff 1994) have found that individuals generally make accurate and reliable judgments of speaker ethnicity, scholars have had difficulty identifying the specific features that listeners react to in making judgments (Thomas 2015). There is also little research about the production side {{of these types of}} ethnic identification tasks and these studies have also often overlooked the potential role of intra-speaker variation in use of suprasegmental features. This study addresses this gap in the literature by focusing on two aspects of production that have been observed to differ between Mainstream U. S. English (MUSE) and African American Language (AAL) : the use of the H* versus L+H* contours and length of peak delay interval. This analysis is based on a sample of eight male speakers with one black parent and one white parent and it specifically explores how these intonational features may be useful in the construction and performance of complex racial identities. Results of regression models indicate that these speakers do not employ pitch accent type in intraspeaker variation, but that they do differ in their use of peak delay, employing longer <b>delay</b> intervals in <b>conversations</b> with black interlocutors than in conversations with white interlocutors. Understanding how speakers employ these and other intonational variables in both intra- and interspeaker variation is an important step in further describing ethnolinguistic varieties as well as addressing the phonetic features that may contribute to linguistic racial profiling...|$|R
40|$|The Hanen Training Programme, (Manolson, 1975) 1 was {{devised to}} empower parents and {{caregivers}} {{to help children}} to communicate {{to the best of}} their abilities. In line with moves within the speech and language therapy profession towards an enabling model, the programme has been used widely by speech and language therapists with parents of children who have <b>delayed</b> language development. <b>Conversation</b> analysis is a qualitative methodology which allows evaluation of interactional aspects of language from naturally-occurring data and which thus has strong ecological validity. Whilst it has been used in speech and language therapy research to analyse interaction and motivate therapy with adults with aphasia, there is limited data published to date using conversation analysis with children. However studies are now emerging which demonstrate the utility of this methodology in relation to this client group (e. g. Volden, 2004) 2. This study investigated the interactions between children and parents before, during and after participation in a Hanen programme, using video tapes which were subjected to conversation analysis. Five children aged between 2 ½ and 4 years with severe/moderate learning difficulties and their parents who were selected for Hanen intervention by their speech and language therapist in a child development centre participated. Videos were transcribed (including nonverbal behaviour) following standard conventions. The three principles advocated by Hanen (allowing, adapting and adding) were investigated by using conversation analysis focussing on: initiation within the parent-child interaction, facilitation used to enable the child to participate, the balance between parent and child turns, and patterns of repair. The researchers analysing the videos were blind to the order of recording. The results of the study will be discussed in terms of their implications for evaluating the effectiveness of the widely used Hanen training techniques, and will provide direction for further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of personal communication devices, personal computers and wireless cellular telephones enables {{the development of new}} inter-personal communication systems. The merge between computers and telephony technologies brings up the demand for convenient hands-free communications. In such systems the users wish to lead a conversation {{in much the same way}} as in a normal person-to-person conversation. The advantages of hands-free telephones are safety, convenience and greater flexibility. In many countries and regions, hand held telephony in cars is prohibited by legislation. By placing the microphone far away from the user a number of disadvantages are introduced, which results in substantial speech distortion and poor sound quality. These disturbances are mainly caused by room reverberation and background noise. Furthermore, acoustic feedback generated at the near-end side is a problem for the far-end side talker, who will hear his/her own voice echoed with 100 - 200 ms <b>delay,</b> making speech <b>conversation</b> substantially more difficult. Digital filtering may be used to obtain a similar sound quality as for hand held telephony. Three major tasks must be addressed in order to improve the quality of hands-free communication systems; noise suppression, room reverberation suppression, and acoustic feedback cancellation of the hands-free loudspeaker. The filtering operation must perform the above mentioned tasks without causing severe near-end speech distortion. A properly designed broad-band microphone array is able to perform all the given tasks, i. e. speech enhancement, echo cancellation and reverberation suppression, in a concise and effective manner. This is due to the fact that the spatial domain may be utilized as well as the temporal domain. This thesis deals with the problem of specification and design of beamformers used to extract the source signal information. A new subband adaptive beamforming algorithm is proposed, where many of the drawbacks embedded in conventional adaptive beamforming are eliminated. Evaluation in a car hands-free situation show the benefits of the proposed method. Blind signal separation is discussed and a new structure based on frequency domain inverse channel identification and time domain separation, is proposed. Further, filter-bank properties and design are discussed together with performance limitations in subband beamforming structures.

30|$|Transmission delay {{can have}} a {{significant}} influence on the interactivity of a conversation and thus on the perceived quality. Early studies {{on the impact of}} conversational delay on speech quality, like the one from Kitawaki and Itoh [8], predicted a severe impact of transmission delay on the perceived speech quality especially when considering highly interactive tasks like the ‘Random Number Verification’ task [9]. However, recent studies [10 – 12] suggested that the impact of <b>delay</b> in close-to-natural <b>conversation</b> scenarios is far less important as suggested in [8]. In the case of everyday life conversations, it was observed that people tend to adapt their communication strategy affecting both the structure and the semantic flow of the conversation (e.g., misunderstandings and interruptions). Still opened is the question about the relative contribution of pure delay impairment to other types of degradations such as coding or network packet loss. In Yamagishi and Hayashi [13], the authors addressed the audiovisual quality prediction of interactive multimedia services such as videotelephony through the use of perceptual dimensions. They identified two dimensions, namely ‘aesthetic feeling’ and ‘feeling of activity.’ The first dimension referred to factors like audio and video coding and packet loss, namely factors distorting the shape of the audiovisual signal. The second dimension was affected by factors related to the temporal continuity like one-way transmission delay and video frame rate. In their experiment, they used the ‘Name Guessing Task’ [9] conversational scenario which has a relatively low interactivity level. In that case, they found the aesthetic feeling dimension to carry more weight in the overall quality perception. However, other findings indicate that for highly interactive scenarios, the impact due to delay predominates quality perception. In contrast, Gros et al. studied the impact of three factors on conversational speech quality: temporal quality degradation profile, network packet loss (between 0 % and 30 %), and jitter (between 500 and 800 ms) [14]. They used short conversation test (SCT) scenarios defined in [15] which are close-to-natural conversational scenarios (e.g., ordering a pizza) and exhibit a middle to low level of interactivity. They pointed out that subjects were sensitive to variations in the transmission characteristics (temporal quality profile) and to packet loss. In turn, adding jitter to packet loss would not lead to a significant decrease in quality ratings. Therefore, delay as an impairment factor may belong to a different perceptual quality dimension, and its weight on the overall quality evaluation compared to other types of impairments like coding and network packet loss impairments depends on the interactivity induced by the conversational scenario. In this study, the focus is brought into the influence of the combined effect of coding and transmission factors and of the type conversational scenario on the perceived audiovisual conversational quality.|$|R
