5000|$|A Royal Naval Armament Depot (RNAD) was an {{armament}} depot (or a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>depots)</b> {{dedicated to}} supplying {{the needs of}} the Royal Navy (as well as, at various times, the Royal Air Force, the British Army and, by arrangement, foreign/commonwealth governments); they were sister depots of Royal Naval Cordite Factories, Royal Naval Torpedo and Royal Naval Mine Depots.|$|E
50|$|Nightfreight GB {{was first}} founded in 1984. A year later in 1985, a {{cooperative}} with several like minded transport companies was formed. This {{was to help}} each other, with parcel deliveries around the country. The original <b>group</b> consisted <b>of</b> seven <b>depots,</b> and a hub operation in Willenhall. Over the next few years, the Nightfreight network grew rapidly, with new members joining the consortium.|$|R
50|$|The former Allison Testing Stands was an {{aero engine}} testing {{facility}} constructed {{in three stages}} during 1942-43 {{for the purpose of}} static testing of engines from the General Motors-Holden's Ltd overhaul plant at Breakfast Creek, Brisbane. Simple and functional in design, the site encompasses six open stands constructed by servicemen of the 81st Air Defence <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> the 44th <b>Depot</b> Repair Squadron; two enclosed engine stands constructed by the Allied Works Council; two open stands of unknown construction; and a concrete pavement area which is the site of former associated buildings.|$|R
50|$|The City of Cookeville, {{with help}} from the nonprofit <b>group</b> Friends <b>of</b> the <b>Depot,</b> {{currently}} maintains the Cookeville Depot as a museum. Along with the depot, the museum maintains a collection of train cars and railroad memorabilia. Engine #509, a 4-6-0 ten-wheeler built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1913, originally used by the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway, was acquired by the museum in 2002 from the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum and its appearance modified to match contemporary Tennessee Central engines. The museum acquired an L&N bay window caboose (with a newer gray-and-yellow paint scheme, as opposed to the traditional red) in 1985, and in 2005 restored a red cupola-style caboose to its original appearance.|$|R
40|$|Six {{patients}} who had experienced prolonged steroid-induced pituitary-adrenal suppression were treated with 100 U <b>of</b> <b>depot</b> procine ACTH every 2 to 4 days for several months. Such treatment did not hasten the recovery of normal pituitary-adrenal function compared with the rate of recovery <b>of</b> a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> similarly suppressed {{patients who}} received no <b>depot</b> ACTH. Eight <b>of</b> nine patients who received prolonged courses <b>of</b> <b>depot</b> porcine ACTH developed antibodies to ACTH that cross-reacted with endogenous ACTH, binding it in the circulation in inactive form and retarding its removal from the circulation. The presence of such antibodies did not in itself grossly alter pituitary-adrenal interrelationships...|$|R
25|$|Captain William O Farrior {{became the}} first pilot to fly the {{earliest}} version of a rebuilt Hamp at Eagle Farm. The intended pilot {{was killed in a}} crash the same day, and Farrior was borrowed from a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 81st Air <b>Depot</b> test pilots and was to become well known for flying the early Japanese aircraft rebuilt at Eagle Farm. He later moved to Anacostia with the ATAIU and remained with intelligence his entire Air Force career. He first flew the Hamp over Brisbane for 30 minutes {{with the help of a}} captured Japanese pilot on 20 July 1943. An Allied aircraft always flew escort during tests of Japanese aircraft at Eagle Farm, and the Japanese aircraft were painted with their insignia to facilitate recognition photography. The Hamp (Zeke 32) was the first Japanese aircraft to be flown in simulated combat against top Allied fighter pilots.|$|R

50|$|In 1976, {{after years}} of {{allowing}} the dilapidation <b>of</b> the train <b>depot</b> on the original Homestead property, the Florida East Coast Railway planned a demolition <b>of</b> the <b>depot.</b> A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> local leaders raised $25,000 to stop the demplition and move the depot to the property behind the Florida Pioneer Museum. Another $200,000 was put into the restoration <b>of</b> the <b>depot</b> in 1988. Unfortunately, Hurricane Andrew leveled the depot in 1992. The current train depot on the property is {{a replica of the}} original.|$|R
500|$|Depot Town is {{immediately}} northeast of downtown Ypsilanti.

A three-way bridge, known as the [...] "tridge", links the two parks and Depot Town over the Huron River. Just beyond Riverside Park, the Michigan Firehouse Museum is at the corner of Cross Street and Huron Street. Prospect Park, the oldest park in Ypsilanti, is one block west <b>of</b> <b>Depot</b> Town on Cross Street. The Corner Brewery, just north <b>of</b> <b>Depot</b> Town, is also commonly associated with the district, and Highland Cemetery is a half-mile north <b>of</b> <b>Depot</b> Town on River Street.|$|R

40|$|The location-routing problem {{occurs in}} the context of {{physical}} distribution system design. Important elements in the design of a physical distribution system are location <b>of</b> <b>depots</b> and distribution <b>of</b> goods from <b>depots</b> to customers. Most research on the location <b>of</b> <b>depots</b> assumes that the distribution <b>of</b> goods from <b>depots</b> to customers occurs in a straight to-and-back manner while computing distribution costs, which is true only if the delivery to each customer is a truckload. For less than truckload (LTL) deliveries to customers, multiple customers are served in a single route. Thus, the true distribution costs are the route costs for all customers. The location-routing approach, which considers routing costs during the location <b>of</b> <b>depots</b> overcomes this deficiency. In this research, three new location-routing models are developed and compared. Their overall performance is evaluated in comparison to existing location-routing approaches based on location-allocation modeling, followed by routing on the allocated customer set. The results show the superior performance of the new location-routing models. distribution heuristics location routing...|$|R
