5|$|Marthinus Pretorius {{hoped to}} achieve either {{federation}} or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, {{but before he}} could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. William Morris, {{on behalf of the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E

5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a realignment across a bend in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the smaller engines came a need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> heavily built gearbox that would offer six ratios to choose between, to keep the engine within its narrower torque band. Following an interim six-speed update of the C5S model, Maddock set about a complete redesign to produce the new C6S. Although the new gearbox was just as reliable as the five speed model, its mechanism was extremely complex and proved unpopular with the mechanics who were tasked with maintaining it.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommendations}} of Guyton covered only {{what would be}} today known as inorganic compounds. With the massive expansion of organic chemistry {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} and the greater understanding of the structure of organic compounds, the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> ad hoc system of nomenclature was felt just as the theoretical tools became available to make this possible. An international conference was convened in Geneva in 1892 by the national chemical societies, from which the first widely accepted proposals for standardization arose.|$|E
25|$|After {{the newly}} founded Calgary Broncos folded prior to {{commencement}} of the inaugural WHA season, the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers {{as it was}} planned to split their home games between Edmonton and Calgary. Possibly for financial reasons or to allow <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> complicated return of the WHA to Calgary, though, the team ultimately played all of its home games in the Edmonton Gardens and subsequently changed its name back to the Edmonton Oilers the following year. They won the first game in WHA history 7–4 over the Ottawa Nationals.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, Democrats {{gained control}} of the Massachusetts state {{legislature}} in coalition with the Free Soilers. The Free Soilers named Sumner their choice for U.S. Senator. The Democrats initially opposed him and called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> radical candidate. The impasse was broken after three months and Sumner was elected by a one-vote majority on April 24, 1851. His election marked a sharp break in Massachusetts politics, as his abolitionist politics contrasted sharply those of his most well-known predecessor in the seat, Daniel Webster, who {{had been one of}} the foremost supporters of the Compromise of 1850 and its Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Clark {{was elected}} President of the Prehistoric Society.

The determination of textbook content would be made in consultation with the churches, with passages offensive to the church excised. Church-owned school buildings would be permitted to be used, pending the decision by local school trustees to lease them from the church, and religious instruction could occur in such buildings if the regular school day was not shortened for the purpose. The effect of the arrangements regarding church buildings and religious schooling was to limit Catholic education to urban centres and to move further argument back down {{to the level of the}} local school boards.|$|E
25|$|In Peru, {{the ancient}} Incas are {{believed}} to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought {{to play a role in}} the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was isolated in 1860 and first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, bupivacaine in 1957, and prilocaine in 1959.|$|E
25|$|After filming {{completed}} in June, Craven spent two months editing the final product, encountering repeated {{conflicts with the}} film rating body MPAA concerning the content of scenes, being forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and violence to avoid an NC-17. Though Dimension Films had previously released NC-17 films, the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience and thus they were desperate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>less</b> restrictive R-rating. For an early scene involving {{the death of the}} character Casey Becker, Craven lied to the MPAA by claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense, in order to keep it in the film. In interviews, Craven indicated that the conflict was enough that, at the time, he was considering leaving the horror genre. In total, Craven sent eight different cuts of the film to the MPAA before Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA, believing they misunderstood to which genre Scream belonged. Weinstein explained to the organisation that although he agreed it was intense, it also had comedic elements and satirized its content and was not just a horror film glorifying violence. The MPAA reviewed their decision and granted the film an R-rating.|$|E
