5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia,</b> emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of hypoplastic anemia which {{suddenly}} attacked a female, age 23, under the treatment with Dilantin (Aleviatin), an anticonvulsant and drove her to death {{three weeks after the}} onset of the disease in spite of various therapies. The chief complaints were a high fever, subcutaneous and gingival bleeding and pharyngealgia. On admission severe <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia,</b> severe leukopenia with lymphocytosis (95 %), thrombopenia, hemorrhagic diathesis, angina and typical myelogram were noticed. At autopsy the bone marrow showed hypoplasia and maturation arrest. It is emphasized that the single treatment with Dilantin may produce severe hematopoietic disturbance such as hypoplastic anemia that have not been reported...|$|E
40|$|A 30 -years-old Salvin’s amazon parrot (Amazona autumnalis salvini) with {{a history}} of a lifelong poor diet and {{inappropriate}} housing was presented in lateral recumbency to a veterinary teaching hospital for further evaluation. Radiological and ultrasonographical examination revealed a mild proventricular dilatation, mild hepatomegaly, signs of enteritis and air sacculitis. Main laboratory findings included a mild macrocytic <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia,</b> hypoglobulinemia, decreased bile acids and increased alkaline phosphatase. In this bird a liver pathology was suspected because of the clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographical findings. The bird was treated with supportive care and metabolic aids. After initial improvement of the clinical signs the bird’s condition deteriorated and it died. Pathological findings revealed an endo- and myocarditis due to Lactobacillus jensenii and a bacteremia. Endocarditis due to Lactobacillus sp. is a rare phenomenon in humans not yet described in animals. It is associated with severe underlying illnesses leading to translocation of otherwise non-pathogenic bacteria in the bloodstream. A similar pattern might be assumed in animals with compromised immunity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Herein we {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 56 -years old patient presented with general malaise, anorexia and progressive weight loss for about 5 years associated recently with diarrhoea and repeated syncopal attacks for 1 month. On admission, he had splenomegaly and his laboratory studies showed macrocytic <b>hyperchromic</b> haemolytic <b>anemia</b> [Hb = 9. 4 g/dl] and a signifi cant hyponatremia [Na+ = 111 mmol/l]. Endocrinological evaluation revealed an isolated adrenocorticotropin defi ciency (IAD) with a manifest hypoaldosteronism. On treatment with cortisone, both anemia and hyponatremia (but not spleno-megaly) were markedly improved. Our case may represent an evidence for the pathogenesis of erythropoietic dysfunction in patients of adrenocortical insuffi ciency...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{physiological}} role of tissue-specific translational control of gene expression in mammals {{has long been}} suspected {{on the basis of}} biochemical studies, direct evidence has been lacking. Here, we report on the targeted disruption of the gene encoding the heme-regulated eIF 2 α kinase (HRI) in mice. We establish that HRI, which is expressed predominantly in erythroid cells, regulates the synthesis of both α- and β-globins in red blood cell (RBC) precursors by inhibiting the general translation initiation factor eIF 2. This inhibition occurs when the intracellular concentration of heme declines, thereby preventing the synthesis of globin peptides in excess of heme. In iron-deficient HRI–/– mice, globins devoid of heme aggregated within the RBC and its precursors, resulting in a <b>hyperchromic,</b> normocytic <b>anemia</b> with decreased RBC counts, compensatory erythroid hyperplasia and accelerated apoptosis in bone marrow and spleen. Thus, HRI is a physiological regulator of gene expression and cell survival in the erythroid lineage...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} 46 -year-old man with {{myocarditis}} due to Churg-Strauss syndrome, who {{was admitted to}} our hospital because of marked hyperlipidemia and liver dysfunction. He had been an outpatient because of the impaired cardiac function after myocarditis due to Churg-Strauss syndrome. He had drunk alcohol 200 mg/day for 3 months before admission. His serum at the outpatient clinic was markedly hemolytic and chylous. The serum bilirubin level was 2. 2 mg/dl, of which direct bilirubin was 1. 1 mg/dl. The serum cholesterol level was 801 mg/dl, and the triglyceride level was 3, 564 mg/dl. Macrocytic <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia</b> was revealed. These abnormalities improved rapidly after admission. The cause of his severe hyperlipidemia was attributed to the complication of Zieve's syndrome, because the triad of the syndrome, jaundice, hyperlipidemia and hemolytic anemia, were present after the alcohol abuse. Furthermore, the hyperlipidemia {{was thought to be}} enhanced by the adrenocorticosteroid, which had been prescribed for myocarditis due to Churg-Strauss syndrome...|$|E
40|$|By intraperitoneally injecting {{to normal}} guinea pigs the {{antiserum}} of bone marrow {{obtained from the}} normal rabbits to which the intraperitoneal injection of the guinea-pig bone marrow had been previously given, the author studied {{the changes in the}} peripheral blood and bone-marrow pictures in these guinea pigs; and arrived at the following conclusions: 1. By the intraperitoneal injection of bone-marrow anti-serum a transient <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia</b> can be recognized in the test guinea pigs. Namely, the number of erythrocytes and the hemoglobin (Hb) content are decreased, and anisocytosis, erythroblasts, polychromatic erythrocytes, and the erythrocytes possessing basophilic spots are recognized. Reticulocytes have been found to have increased in some of the test animals. 2. The number of leucocytes fluctuates with the injection of the anti-serum of bone marrow, and in the relatively greater number of animals leucocytes tend to decrease at first and later increase. In the leucocyte percentage, a decrease in pseudoeosinophils, and an increase in lymphocytes can be observed in most of animals, and also eosinophils increase in number. Besides these, the appearance cf young granulocytes such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes as well as the regressive degeneration of various leucocyte cells can be recognized. 3. Platelets are decreased in number in all cases with the injection of bone-marrow anti-serum. 4. As for the bone-marrow picture in the majority of the test guinea pigs the interferance with the production of erythroblasts can be observed, and in some of the test animals the impairment of maturation of erythroblasts and {{in another part of the}} test animals the left shift of nuclei in pseudo-eosinophils can be seen. 5. Judging from the relatively slight effect of the normal rabbit serum on the peripheral blood and bone marrow of guinea pigs, it is assumed that the anemia inducing action of the bone-marrow anti-serum is specific...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of anemia with pregnancy is well recognized. In this country the anemia is commonly due to iron deficiencies and is hypochromic. In the tropics a macrocytic, <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia</b> of pregnancy has attracted attention {{and has been}} the subject of many recent investigations. Its counterpart in the temperate climates, the macrocytic or so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy, has been considered a relatively rare dyscrasia. ', The macrocytic anemia of pregnancy was first recognized over a century ago when Channing 2 reported ten fatal cases. In 1919 Osler 7 differentiated the so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy from typical Addisonian anemia by pointing out that when recovery from the former disease took place it was permanent and the woman might escape it in subsequent pregnancies. In macrocytic anemia of pregnancy the peripheral blood picture may vgry from one identical with that of true pernicous anemia to one lacking all characteristic features of this anemia. 1 13 On the other hand, examination of the bone marrow reveals pictures identical with those found in true Addisonian pernicious anemia and clearly indicates that macrocytic anemia of pregnancy has for its immediate cause arrested maturation of the megaloblasts. The two features which may be relied upon for the certain diagnosis of macrocytic anemia of pregnancy are the appearance of megaloblasts in the peripheral blood and the finding of a megaloblastic change in the bone marrow. 1 If the peripheral blood picture is not diagnostic, bone marrow biopsy by means of sternal puncture is necessary or some cases will be missed. The following features serve to differentiate the macrocytic anemia of pregnancy from the true Addisonian pernicious anemia: the presence of free hydrochloric acid in gastric juice either without or after histamine injection, a lower frequency and the degree of macrocytosis an...|$|E
40|$|That infants fed a diet {{comprised}} chiefly of goat's milk {{may develop}} an anemia {{has been observed}} by many investigators (see Alt', Davidson and Leitch 6, and Kronacher et al. 9), particularly in Continental Europe where this kind of milk has been employed extensively in infant feeding. Although there is some difference of opinion, the balance of clinical evidence {{seems to indicate that}} goat's milk anemia is usually the hyperchromic type and is more severe than is cow's milk anemia (Davidson and Leitch 6). Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the anemia-producing effect of goat's milk. One of these postulates the presence of toxic substances in the milk, perhaps certain types of fatty acids in the milk fat (see Brouwer 4, Davidson and Leitch 6, de Rudder" 5, Rominger, Meyer and Bomskov 12, and Stoltzner 17), which promote an increased rate of erythrocyte destruction and thus cause an anemia. However, the fact that the administration of relatively large amounts of fatty acids prepared from goat's milk or mixtures of pure fatty acids to animals receiving either a mixed ration or a goat's milk diet had no noticeable effect on the composition of the blood (Bomskov and Auffarth 3) seems to preclude the possibility of the presence of a hemolytic agent in the fat of goat's milk. Other recent work, to be discussed later, likewise lends no support to the "toxic theory" of the etiology of goat's milk anemia. Another explanation of the cause of goat's milk anemia is that this type of milk is deficient in some necessary hematogenic substance, such as iron (Brouwer 5) or, as has been recently suggested (Rominger et al. 12, 14, Gyorgy 7), an essential organic substance perhaps related to the "extrinsic factor " said to be needed for the prevention of pernicious anemia in man. The evidence upon which the latter view is based was obtained chiefly from experiments on young albino rats fed an exclusive goat's milk diet. A severe <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia</b> developed and the condition was not cured by iro...|$|E
40|$|Anemia of {{inflammatory}} disease (AID) {{is the most}} common anemia in humans and animals but has been investigated in the cat only in a few, mainly experimentally studies. The pathogenesis in AID is multifactorial, resulting from decreased iron availability, a decline in erythrocyte survival time and a decreased response to anemia. The aim of this clinical study was to describe the course of AID, laboratory parameters important for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of AID and the therapy of 26 cats with {{inflammatory disease}}s (abscess [a] n= 13, pyothorax [pt] n= 7, pyometra [pyo] n= 1, mycobacterial infection n= 1, fat necrosis [fn] n= 4). Cats with a positive FeLV/FIV test result, with a neoplasia, nephro- or hepatopathy as well as animals with blood loss anemia were excluded from the study. A complete blood cell count, clinical chemistry, serum concentrations of erythropoietin (EPO), iron and ferritin, the total iron binding capacity (TIBC), the acute-phase-proteins &# 61537; 1 -AGP and haptoglobin, the osmotic fragility (OF) of erythrocytes as well as a direct Coombs test were performed. The hct was monitored over 3 - 51 days (mean 15. 5, median 11). Eleven of 26 cats were anemic on presentation, whereas 12 cats developed anemia during hospitalization. Three other cats did not develop anemia; the hematocrit (Hct) of 2 cats decreased within the reference range (pt, fn) and an increase was noted in one cat (a). The anemia was predominantly mild (47. 9 %) to moderate (39. 1 %), but in some cases (13 %) also severe. The Hct decreased  depending on the timepoint of measurement  from the 2 nd to 7 th day after hospitalization and decreased further throughout a period of 3 - 16 days. In 6 cats the Hct values were within the reference range 2 - 18 days after surgery (a), 18 days after start of the therapy (pt) and 10 - 19 days after surgery (fn). On the other hand 17 of the cats remained anemic over various timespans: up to 29 days (a), up to 16 days (pt), up to 40 days (pyo) or 51 days (mycobacterial infection) and 15 days (fn). In 95. 6 % of patients the anemia was mainly normocytic, whereas a constant microcytic anemia was present in one cat (4, 4 %). A temporary mild macrocytosis occured in 3 cats (13 %). In all patients, anemia was predominantly normochromic with only a few measurements of hypo- or <b>hyperchromic</b> <b>anemia</b> (26. 1 % and 21. 7 %). In 73. 9 % of cases the anemia was non-regenerative, whereas in 6 cats (26. 1 %) a mild regeneration (43, 200 - 84, 450 aggregated reticulocytes/µl) was noticed. Leukocytosis (18. 9 - 150. 0 &# 61620; 109 /l) was observed in 22 of 26 and a left shift in 12 of 19 patients, however the cats without leukocytosis also developed an AID. The acute-phase-protein &# 61537; 1 -AGP was elevated in all examined 19 patients over a period of 7 days prior to 14 days after surgery. Haptoglobin however was elevated in 16 of 19 cats and within the reference range in 3 animals 5, 7 and 14 days after beginning of the therapy. Neither the Hct value nor the number of aggregated reticulocytes showed an inverse correlation with the number of leukocytes, the &# 61537; 1 -AGP or haptoglobin concentration. Conspicuous results were a lowered albumin/globulin-ratio in 92. 3 % of the patients as well as hypoalbuminemia (84. 6 %) and hyperglobulinemia (76. 9 %). These results agree with abnormalities seen in the acute-phase-reaction. As opposed to documentations on serum iron levels for humans and dogs cats rarely (13 %) had lowered serum iron levels. However 47. 8 % of the cats had levels within the lower third of the reference range. As TIBC was often (39. 1 %) lowered or within the lower third of the reference range (47. 8 %) and was never elevated and the ferritin concentration was predominantly (60. 9 %) elevated and never lowered, it seems that these parameters are helpful for the diagnosis of the AID and for the differentiation from an iron deficiency anemia. The positive Coombs test in 2 of 10 examined cats (pt: IgG positive, mycobacterial infection: C 3 b positive), a mild hyperbilirubinemia in 6 of 26 cats (23. 1 %) and an elevated OF of erythrocytes in 2 of 17 animals (11. 8 %) led to the assumption of a shortening of the erythrocyte survival time. In spite of a mild to moderate anemia, EPO concentrations of 30. 8 % of the cats were within the reference range and only slightly elevated in 61. 5 % of the animals. There was no inverse correlation between the EPO concentrations and the parameters of anemia (hct, hemoglobin concentration, number of erythrocytes). Therefore an inadequate EPO production is an important pathomechanism of AID in the cat. Furthermore the bone marrow regeneration response to produced EPO seems to be insufficient, because anemia was non-regenerative in 6 of 8 cats with slightly elevated EPO concentrations. Only one cat (7. 7 %) had high EPO concentrations and had to be euthanized because of its poor condition. A high EPO, as with AID in humans, may be associated with a negative prognosis. A specific therapy of the anemia is usually not necessary because AID in humans and dogs is normally mild. In most animals it was possible to resolve the anemia by treating the underlying disease. However, 3 cats needed 2 - 4 blood transfusions either because of the severity of anemia or for stabilisation before anesthesia. In this study it was shown that feline anemia of inflammatory disease is usually mild to moderate, non-regenerative and normocytic, normochromic. An inflammation, however, may also result in a severe, transfusion-dependent anemia, so that frequent Hct controls are indicated in feline patients with AID. As in humans the pathogenesis of AID seemed to be multifactorial, due to evidence of a shortened erythrocyte survival time, an iron sequestration and an inadequate production of EPO. To this point in time it has not been studied whether EPO, which is used to treat human AID, might be useful in cats with AID...|$|E
