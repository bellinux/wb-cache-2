5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only {{as an agent of}} the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

On returning to their resort, Jai offers {{to pay for the}} trip's expenses, to which Sahil agrees after some initial reluctance. The two return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction right before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts Jai and his clients and embarrasses the latter with a romantic gesture in front of everyone. This leads to a confrontation between the two, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of coming out to the world. On the contrary, Jai blames him for not reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to withdraw from him, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. He apologises and tells Sahil that he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> any longer if he doesn't want to. However, Sahil decides to stay, but refrains from having a conversation with Jai.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 the Aransas Pass & Harbor Company, under {{government}} contracts, {{launched a}} plan to deepen the channel through the pass and over the sandbar. The plan called {{for the construction of}} two brand new jetties but the plan failed to increase the depth of the channel. Another plan was put into action, calling for the blasting of the channel with thousands of pounds of dynamite, but this also failed.

25|$|On 12 March 1945, ICRC {{president}} Jacob Burckhardt {{received a}} message from SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner accepting the ICRC's demand to allow delegates to visit the concentration camps. This agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the camps {{until the end of}} the war. Ten delegates, among them Louis Haefliger (Camp Mauthausen), Paul Dunant (Camp Theresienstadt) and Victor Maurer (Camp Dachau), accepted the assignment and visited the camps. Louis Haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen-Gusen by alerting American troops, thereby saving the lives of about 60,000 inmates. His actions were condemned by the ICRC because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the ICRC's neutrality. Only in 1990, his reputation was finally rehabilitated by ICRC president Cornelio Sommaruga.|$|E

25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{formation}} in December 2007, Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) had not lost a single match, with AAA claiming that their win streak had reached over 600 victories. During {{the fall of}} 2010, Los Psycho Circus were engulfed in a war with the many variations of Los Perros del Mal, with Damián 666, Halloween and the group's leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo being the most prominent Perros during the feud. After several matches {{between the two groups}} went to either a no contest or a countout, they were booked to face each other on December 5 at Guerra de Titanes in a steel cage weapons match, where Los Perros del Mal was represented by Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly. In the end of the match, Halloween and Murder Clown were left in the cage, when someone wearing a Monster Clown mask ran out, climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping the cage, dropping him down to the mat and allowing Halloween to escape the cage, handing Los Psycho Circus their first ever loss. After the match, the man unmasked himself to reveal El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had been sidelined in October with a knee injury with reports stating that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out of the ring {{for the rest of the}} year. The feud between the two groups continued at March's Rey de Reyes, where Los Perros del Mal, represented by Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, was once again victorious in a match against Los Psycho Circus and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial ("World Power"). The feud also spread out to independent promotions International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and Perros del Mal Producciones (PdM); in IWRG, the groups feuded over the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship, which Los Psycho Circus successfully defended against Los Perros, while in PdM, the two groups faced each other in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match, which ended with Super Crazy having his hair head shaved off. In May 2011, AAA announced that the promotion was going to crown their first ever World Trios Champions and started a tournament with the finals being held at Triplemanía XIX. Los Psycho Circus advanced to the finals by defeating La Maniarquía (Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador) and The Black Family (Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu and Dark Ozz), while Los Perros del Mal advanced by defeating Real Fuerza Aérea (Aero Star, Argenis and Laredo Kid) and Los Bizarros (Charly Manson, Cibernético and Escoria) to set up a grudge match for the AAA World Trios Championship at Triplemanía XIX.|$|E

However, the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation, since if it is left too late then thousands could be killed, while if it is started too early then the precursors of the eruption may turn out to have been a false alarm. In 1984, 40,000people were evacuated from the Campi Flegrei area, another volcanic complex near Naples, but no eruption occurred.|$|E

Kettering were fighting against relegation, and Challinor was quoted as saying [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> positive.

He made his debut later that day as a half-time substitute for Callum Wilson in Kettering's 2–1 loss away to Grimsby Town. His first goal for Kettering came in stoppage time against Southport in a 3–1 home victory on 30 April 2011, having entered the match in the 89th minute. Challinor finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal for Kettering. He agreed to stay at Kettering ahead of 2011–12 on non-contract terms, in the belief that a permanent contract would later be agreed, and started the season playing as a defensive midfielder.|$|E
500|$|The first {{reinforcement}} to the Teutonic forces {{arrived in}} early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis. In January 1262 reinforcements {{arrived from the}} Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg {{but as soon as}} the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. [...] Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory (with an exception of Wehlau, now Znamensk), and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262–1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia.|$|E

500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> home and mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who {{were thought to be}} easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We {{have to face the}} possibility that we may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks' appearance, {{and said}} that her role as Jenna's mother was [...] "good casting."

[...] "Laughter wasn't constant during , but the direction it moved in kept interest even when jokes were sparse. That being said, some of the material... were pretty great by even the show's lofty standards", said Paste magazine's Sean Gandert. In his recap, Adam Mersel for TV Guide was complimentary, writing it had [...] "spot-on one-liners, witty pop culture references, and a hilarious guest-star in Jan Hooks", and that [...] "Verna" [...] became his favorite episode of the season. Nick Catucci for New York magazine liked Liz and Frank's plot, noting that their bad habits featured here [...] "culminated in the greatest few moments the show has had in some time." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed this episode of 30 Rock, writing that the show [...] "was firing on all cylinders. It was good for laughs aplenty but it also helped illuminate Jack's paternal relationship with Jenna, the source of some of Jenna's narcissistic craziness and the full measure of Jack's Oedipal hell." [...] Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed [...] "Verna" [...] a solid episode from the show.
