40|$|Background: The {{notion of}} "minimal {{impairment}} in instrumental {{activities of daily}} living (i-ADL) " is important in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but is presently not adequately operationalized. ADL is stratified according to difficulty, complexity, and also to vulnerability to early cognitive changes in a threefold hierarchy: basic {{activities of daily living}} (b-ADL), i-ADL, and advanced activities of daily living (a-ADL). This study aims to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} functional decline in the process of MCI. Methods: In a qualitative design, 37 consecutive patients diagnosed with amnestic (a) -MCI and their proxies were interviewed at two <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Constant comparative analysis was used for the analysis. Results: The a-ADL-concept emerged as important in the diagnosis of MCI. All participants were engaged in a wide range of activities, which could be clustered according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Participants reported subtle difficulties in performance. A process of functional decline was identified in which adaptation and coping mechanisms interacted with the process of reduced skills, leading to an activity disruption and an insufficiency in functioning. Conclusion: This study asserts the inclusion of an evaluation of a-ADL in the assessment of older persons. When evaluating ADL at three levels (b-ADL, i-ADL, and a-ADL), all the activities one can perform in daily living are covered...|$|R
40|$|The <b>geriatric</b> (medical) <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> {{developed}} in the UK during the late 1950 s and 1960 s {{as part of the}} rapid changes that occurred in the care of the frail elderly. While day hos-pitals have been traditionally associated with rehabilitation, it seems that from the beginning they played a number of different roles in the provision of comprehensive geriatric services. For example, Brocklehurst [1] in 1973 described rehabilitation, maintenance, medical and nursing investiga-tion or social care. The situation had changed little by the time of a national survey [2] in 1992 which found that at the point of acceptance for the <b>day</b> <b>hospital,</b> 42 % of patients were referred for rehabilitation, 23 % for maintenance, 17 % for a medical intervention, 7 % for social and respite care and 7 % for assessment.

No single cause predominates among those reported for acute admission or death during the affected year. These findings are relevant given the recent closure of several day hospitals by health authorities to cut costs.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} international literature concerning the organisation of the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Hospital</b> (GDH) was performed. From 1987 till now, few papers were found describing the activity {{and the effectiveness of}} the GDH. All the studies comparing specific geriatric approaches to regular medicine demonstrate the efficiency of geriatric care, particularly the geriatric assessment. So, with a degree of evidence 1 a, a better outcome is found for patients undergoing a geriatric assessment and intervention, compared to patients having no geriatric assessment at all. However, {{there is no evidence of}} benefit for the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> compared to patients treated in a geriatric ward or other location of geriatric care. Moreover, there is no clear consensus on the settings and activities of a <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital.</b> Terms as day unit, day hospital, day care, are used interchangeably and are not always covering the same activity. The same remark can be made on the exact composition of the geriatric multidisciplinary team and its role. However nurses and paramedical workers are always mentioned as all performing geriatric assessment. The diagnostic activities on the GDH are seldom described and studied. More information is available on rehabilitation activity, often developed in specific patient populations such as stroke patients, dementia patients, cardiac patients or patients with other chronic diseases. In this selected patient populations positive effects on outcome are shown in the GDH (level of evidence 1 a). Another problem is the heterogeneity of the population. For scientific reason the GDH should focus on organising care for specific medical problems. Diseases as dementia, stroke, cardiac insufficiency, could be good models to investigate the efficiency of geriatric assessment and interventions within the setting of a GDH...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} address the {{challenges}} of an ageing population the Belgian government decided to allocate resources {{to the creation of}} <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospitals</b> (GDHs). Although GDHs are meant to be a strategy to support general practitioners (GPs) caring for the frail elderly, few Belgian GPs seem to refer to a GDH. This study aims to explore the barriers and facilitating factors of GPs' referral to GDHs. Methods A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted. Fifteen FGDs were organized in the different Belgian regions (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels). Results Contextual factors such as the unsatisfactory cooperation between hospital and GPs and organizational barriers such as the lack of communication on referral procedures between hospital and primary health care (PHC) were identified. Lack of basic knowledge about the concept or the local organization of GDH seemed to be a problem. Unclear task descriptions, responsibilities and activities of a GDH formed prominent points of discussion in all FGDs. Nevertheless a lot of possible advantages and disadvantages of GDHs for the patient and for the GP were mentioned. Conclusions In the case of poor referral to GDHs, focusing on improving overall collaboration between primary and secondary health care is essential. This can be achieved by actively delivering adequate information, permanent communication and more involvement of PHC in the organization and functioning of GDHs. The absence of a transparent health care system with delineated role definitions, seems to hinder the integration of new initiatives like GDHs in the care process. Strategies to enhance referral to GDHs should use a comprehensive approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} deliver individual, {{specialized}} and multidisciplinary care for older people, the Belgian national health authorities developed the care {{program for the}} geriatric patient. In that context, 48 <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospitals</b> (GDHs) have been financed by the government since January 1 (st) 2006. The main objective {{of this study is}} to describe the patient characteristics, facility features and activities related to the Belgian GDHs. Methods: A prospective, multicenter study was performed from October 1 (st) till December 31 (st) 2006 in all 48 GDHs. For each GDH a transversal data collection was carried out. In the same period all patients scheduled for the GDHs were registered and followed for 3 months. Therefore two questionnaires were developed using Filemakers (R) software: one for each GDH and one for each patient. There were no exclusion criteria. Results: Six GDHs did not complete one or both questionnaires. Consequently, the results of 42 GDHs were included. GDHs with more years of activity had significantly more new patient contacts per day. Activities in the Belgian GDHs were mainly diagnostic with emphasis on geriatric syndromes and specific medical problems. The reason for admission to the GDH was often multifactorial. The syndromes that motivated patients 75 or older to visit the GDH were clearly geriatric (mainly cognitive disorders) and represent the principle public health problems in this age category. Despite the legal provision preserving GDHs for patients 75 years or older a quarter of all patients was younger than 75, presenting with a geriatric syndrome. The contribution of the general practitioners was limited. Conclusions: Activities in the Belgian GDHs are mainly diagnostic with emphasis on geriatric syndromes (particularly cognitive disorders) and specific medical problems.

It opened on November 29, 1987 following the closure of two smaller and older Dublin hospitals: The Charitable Infirmary, better known as Jervis Street Hospital and St. Lawrence's Hospital (known as The Richmond). Beaumont Hospital took over management of St. Joseph's Hospital, Dublin, which is located 2 miles east of Beaumont Hospital in Raheny, in 2004. The Dublin Brain Bank, a research facility for post mortem storage and examination of brain tissue, opened at Beaumont Hospital in 2008.

40|$|Background: Stroke {{survivors}} may not {{be receiving}} optimal rehabilitation {{as a result of}} a shortage of hospital resources, and many of them are institutionalized. A rehabilitation program provided in a short-term residential care setting may help to fill the service gap. Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were, first, to examine whether there were significant differences in terms of rehabilitation outcomes at 1 year after admission to the rehabilitation program (defined as baseline) between those using short-term residential care (intervention group) and those using usual <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> care (control group), and, second, to investigate whether lower 1 -year institutionalization rates were observed in the intervention group than in the control group. Participants: 155 stroke survivors who completed at least the first follow-up at 4 months after baseline. Intervention: The intervention group was stroke survivors using self-financed short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation. The control group was stroke survivors using the usual care at a public <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital.</b> Measurements: Assessments were conducted by trained research assistants using structured questionnaires at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year after baseline. The primary outcome measures included Modified Barthel Index score, Mini-Mental Status Examination score, and the institutionalization rate. Results: Cognitive status (as measured by Mini-Mental Status Examination score) of patients in both groups could be maintained from 4 months to 1 year, whereas functional status (as measured by Modified Barthel Index score) of the patients could be further improved after 4 months up to 1 year. Meanwhile, insignificant between-group difference in rehabilitation outcomes was observed. The intervention participants had a significantly lower 1 -year institutionalization rate (15. 8 %) than the control group (25. 8 %). Conclusion: Short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation promoted improvements in rehabilitation outcomes comparable with, if not better than, the usual care at <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital.</b> Furthermore, it had a significantly lower 1 -year institutionalization rate.

40|$|Aim To {{describe}} the aesthetic and cultural pursuits of older patients in hospital. Background Although {{there is much}} discussion {{of the importance of}} arts 1 in health, {{little is known about the}} salience of aesthetic and cultural pursuits of hospital patients. Design A qualitative, hermeneutic phenomenological study (Van Manen, 1990) examined artistic and cultural interests and experiences of older hospital patients and their perceptions of aesthetics of hospital. Methods A phenomenological study (Van Manen) was carried out in 2011, using purposeful sampling with twenty in-patients aged over 65, ten with experience of hospital arts programme. Patients were selected from the <b>geriatric</b> medicine <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> of a university teaching hospital. Results Seven themes identified: loss and the impact of illness on leisure activities; patients’ interests and passions; a lack of expectation of arts in hospital; the positive impact of arts in hospital for those who had experienced them; varying preference between receptive and participative arts activities according to phase of illness; negative aesthetic aspects of the hospital experience; recommendations for changes to improve arts in hospital. Conclusions Aesthetic and cultural interests are important in the lives of older patients admitted to hospital. Illness can create barriers to artistic engagement. Participation in arts activities may be more important during recovery and rehabilitation, with receptive arts being more popular during the acute phase of illness in hospital. Further research recommended on the role of the aesthetic environment for patients’ health and well-being as well as receptive arts in hospital. Acceptedpeer-reviewe...|$|R

Study design: This was a two-year study using focus groups and interviews for instrument development, questionnaires for data collection and workshops to provide study feedback. Data were collected in 2005 – 06. Study site: One Scottish health board. Inclusion criteria: All National Health Service healthcare professionals working wherever stroke care occurred. Population and sample: Participants were drawn from 4 university teaching hospitals, 2 community <b>hospitals,</b> 1 <b>geriatric</b> medicine <b>day</b> <b>hospital,</b> 48 general practices (GPs), 12 care homes and 15 community teams. The sample comprised 155 doctors, 313 nurses, 133 therapists (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists), and 29 ‘other HCPs’ (14 dieticians, 7 pharmacists, 2 podiatrists and 6 psychologists). Results: HCPs prefer face-to-face, accredited education but blended approaches are required that accommodate uni- and multidisciplinary demands. Doctors and nurses are more inclined towards discipline-specific training compared to therapists and other healthcare professionals (HCPs). HCPs in primary care and stroke units want {{more information on the}} social impact of stroke while those working in stroke units in particular are concerned with leadership in the multidisciplinary team.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{reported}} for {{over the past decade}} that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) may associate with the emergence of apathy. The authors hypothesized that depressed patients treated with SSRI's would show more signs of apathy than patients treated with non-SSRI antidepressants. This case control study was conducted to investigate the possibility of the association between SSRI use and the occurrence of apathy. Methods Baycrest Centre for <b>Geriatric</b> Care's <b>Day</b> <b>Hospital</b> Database of elderly depressed patients who received antidepressants was divided into 2 groups depending on antidepressant use at discharge: SSRI user group-SUG, and non-SSRI user group-NSUG. Apathy scales developed by the authors were selected from the Geriatric depression Scale (GDS) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and were titled as GDS-apathy subscale (GAS) and HAMD-apathy subscale (HAS). Demographic data, baseline apathy, underlying medical conditions and medication use were studied. Proportion, analysis of variances, Chi-square test, odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval were reported. Results Among 384 patients (160 SUG and 224 NSUG), mean GDS and HAM-D at discharge were 12. 46 and 10. 61 in SUG, and were 11. 37 and 9. 30 in NSUG, respectively. Using GAS for apathy assessment, 83. 7 % of patients in SUG and 73. 4 % in NSUG stayed apathetic at discharge. As evaluated by HAS, 44. 2 % of patients in SUG and 36. 5 % in NSUG stayed apathetic. SSRI use was not a predictor of apathy at admission, while it was at discharge, p = 0. 029. The SUG showed more patients with apathy than that found in NSUG (adjusted OR = 1. 90 (1. 14 – 3. 17). Age 70 – 75 years tended to be a predictor for the apathy (p = 0. 058). Using HAS, age 70 – 75 years and living situation were associated with apathy at discharge, p = 0. 032 and 0. 038 respectively.

Conclusion: Short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation promoted improvements in rehabilitation outcomes comparable with, if not better than, the usual care at <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>hospital.</b> Furthermore, it had a significantly lower 1 -year institutionalization rate. This type of service could be promoted to prevent institutionalization. Keywords: stroke, institutionalization, rehabilitation, residential care, day hospita...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the nutritional status and physical function of 121 women (79. 4 +/- 6. 6 y, 26. 8 +/- 5. 6 kg/m 2) and 61 men (78. 6 +/- 8. 3 y, 26. 6 +/- 4. 7 kg/m 2) {{participating in the}} <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Hospital.</b> According to a composite index of malnutrition, 19 % of them were found malnourished whereas the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, a validated nutritional screening tool, found that 56 % of the elderly were malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. Malnourished persons, {{as determined by the}} composite index, had a lower lean body mass (LBM) by bioelectrical impedance analysis compared with the well-nourished group (40. 5 +/- 9. 7 vs. 42. 0 +/- 8. 7 kg, p = 0. 0001). LBM correlated significantly with handgrip strength (r = 0. 34, p = 0. 0001) but not with gait speed (r = 0. 04, p = 0. 27). There {{were no significant differences between}} nutritional states for any of the two tests of physical function. The score of the MNA, correlated with gait speed (r = 0. 24, p = 0. 02) but the performance at the physical tests was not different according to the nutritional status defined by this tool. We conclude that malnutrition is relatively prevalent among frail persons participating in the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Hospital</b> and that malnutrition is one among many other factors that contribute to their low level of physical performance. As such, a nutritional intervention may be of benefit in improving the physical function of frail elderly persons who are malnourished...|$|E
40|$|Meng Chen, Quan Zhou Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People’s Republic of ChinaWe {{read with}} great {{interest}} the prospective study by Cortejoso et al, 1 which describes the characteristics of pharmaceutical interventions in two geriatric wards (orthogeriatric ward and <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> unit) of a general teaching hospital. We strongly agree with their finding that shows the importance of clinical pharmacist involvement in the optimization of pharmacotherapy in elderly patients. Furthermore, we especially appreciate their new and interesting findings that the clinical pharmacist was more frequently requested by physicians and nurses {{for information about the}} pharmacotherapy of the patients on the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> unit, compared with the orthogeriatric ward at admission and discharge (5. 7 % vs 1. 2 % and 1. 7 %, respectively, P< 0. 05), and that the pharmacist asked for more confirmation of the physician orders on the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> unit rather than the orthogeriatric ward (19. 8 % vs 1. 8 % and 15. 7 % at admission and discharge, respectively, P< 0. 05). We are from a Joint Commission International (JCI) -accredited academic medical center hospital with 3200 beds in China. Safe medication management and use are pivotal to patient safety and quality of care on which the state-of-the-art standards of the Joint Commission focus. We would like to share our perspectives in the following paragraphs. View original paper by Cortejoso and colleagues.  ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Relationships between <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> {{treatment}} goals, {{self-help group}} participa-tion, {{and substance use}} outcome were examined for 1 80 alcohol- or cocaine-dependent male patients in a <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> Veterans Administration substance abuse program. Method: The primary goals assessed were completion of the <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> program and participation in posttreatment self-help groups. For subjects who completed the <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> program, prog-ress toward three other goals was also assessed: decreased denial, endorsement of 1 2 -Step beliefs, and participation in self-help groups during the <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> program. The outcome measures were urine toxicology and self-reports ofalcohol or cocaine use at 4 - and 7 -month post-intake follow-up interviews. Results: <b>Day</b> <b>hospital</b> completion and participation in post-treatment self-help groups predicted better outcome. Self-help participation also predicted outcome after <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> completion was controlled. Among subjects who completed the <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> program, the other three goals did not predict substance use outcome. However, involvement with self-help groups during the <b>day</b> <b>hospital</b> program and decreases in denial predicted continued involvement with self-help groups. Conclusions: Patients who complete day hospitalsubstance abuse rehabilitation and then continue to participate in self-help group...|$|R
