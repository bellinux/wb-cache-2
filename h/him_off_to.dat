5|$|The son, Prince Salim, {{grows up}} to be spoiled, flippant, and self-indulgent. His father sends <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war, to teach him courage and discipline. Fourteen years later, Salim returns as a {{distinguished}} soldier (Dilip Kumar) and {{falls in love with}} court dancer Nadira, whom the emperor has renamed Anarkali (Madhubala), meaning pomegranate blossom. The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar (Nigar Sultana), a dancer of a higher rank, who wants the prince to love her so that she may one day become queen. Unsuccessful in winning Salim's love, she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali. Salim pleads to marry Anarkali, but his father refuses, and imprisons her. Despite her treatment, Anarkali refuses to reject Salim, as Akbar demands.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott SteinerSteiner was {{accompanied}} by Petey Williams and Rhaka Khan. At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers. Steiner countered this by placing Joe in his signature Steiner Recliner submission maneuver, which Joe escaped by lifting him in the air on his shoulders. Kaz then jumped off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe {{in the head with a}} steel pipe while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the head and then performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

As he grows up he proves his valour in various exploits, the king's daughter Josian {{falls in love with}} him, and the king makes Beves a knight and presents him with a sword called Morgelai and a horse called Arondel. Beves repels an invasion by the Saracen king Brademond, but falls out with Josian, whom he finds too independent-minded. The two are reconciled when Josian declares she will be a Christian. Ermin, believing that Beves has deflowered his daughter, sends him to Brademond with a sealed letter in which Brademond is asked to kill him. Beves reaches Damascus, insults the Saracen gods, and presents his letter to Brademond, who immediately casts Beves into a deep pit.|$|E
25|$|American {{society as}} a whole moved toward {{integration}} in the post-War years, partially {{as a result of the}} distinguished service by African American military units such as the Tuskegee Airmen, 366th Infantry Regiment, and others. During the baseball winter meetings in 1943, noted African American athlete and actor Paul Robeson campaigned for integration of the sport. After WorldWarII ended, several team managers considered recruiting members of the Negro Leagues for entry into organized baseball. In the early 1920s, New York Giants' manager John McGraw slipped a black player, Charlie Grant, into his lineup (reportedly by passing <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the front office as an Indian), and McGraw's wife reported finding names of dozens of Negro players that McGraw fantasized about signing, after his death. Pittsburgh Pirates owner Bill Bensawanger reportedly signed Josh Gibson to a contract in 1943, and the Washington Senators were also said to be interested in his services. But those efforts (and others) were opposed by Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's powerful commissioner and a staunch segregationist. Bill Veeck made the (now often disputed claimed) that Landis blocked his purchase of the Philadelphia Phillies because he planned to integrate the team. While this is disputed, Landis was opposed to integration, and his death in 1944 (and subsequent replacement as Commissioner by Happy Chandler) removed a major obstacle for black players in the major leagues.|$|E

25|$|Garmin-Cervélo {{was again}} {{touted as a}} strong team for the season's second monument, the Tour of Flanders, with Hushovd perhaps seen as the strongest of the team's three leaders. Noted in the team's favor was the {{leadership}} of sporting director Peter Van Petegem, twice a winner of this race. On race day, Hammond made the day's first major breakaway group, one which stayed away over the first ten cobbled climbs. Hushovd effectively stayed {{at the front of}} the race most of the day, even chasing back on to the front after puncturing on the Taaienberg. However, attacks from the likes of Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara on the Leberg gapped <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the point that he never was able to rejoin the front of the race. He finished with the second large group on the road, over four minutes down, in 54th place. Garmin-Cervélo had no riders factor into the race's finale; Farrar fared slightly better than Hushovd, leading the first large group across the finish line, but he was a minute and a half down in 12th place. Haussler was over eight minutes back, having never been a factor in the race. After yet another disappointing showing in a major spring classic, one post-race analysis suggested the team should no longer be considered favorites in single-day races.|$|E

He warns Mick, and eventually Dean's parents Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) and Shirley, who arrive after Ronnie has given him a drink full of crushed up drugs. She reveals it was only a plan to scare him, but it is enough to make Roxy confess to Dean that Ronnie is a murderer, so he convinces Roxy to go to the police. Ronnie is seemingly arrested during a family dinner with the Mitchells. However, Ronnie realises they aren't police, and they drop her off in a wasteland, only for her to be picked up by Vincent. He tells her the police are going to charge her for Carl's murder, and she needs {{to get out of the}} country.

However, Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) gives her a file he found in Vincent's safe, revealing he is working to take down the Mitchells. Vincent tries to blackmail her into framing Phil for drug trafficking, using a confession of her admitting to killing Carl. Phil, who has returned to drinking, disowns Ronnie, but she still protects him when Vincent plants a gun on him and calls the police. After, Ronnie destroys the copies of her confession and keeps the gun, threatening to kill Vincent if he threatens her again.|$|E
