40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the improvement of the quality of care. For physicians, it is a problem that they are often not aware of gaps in their knowledge and the corresponding <b>information</b> <b>needs.</b> Our research aim is to resolve this problem by formulating <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> automatically. Based on these <b>information</b> <b>needs,</b> patient-specific literature can be retrieved. As a first step, we investigate how to model a physician's <b>information</b> <b>needs.</b> Thereafter, we design and analyse an approach to instantiate the model with patient data, resulting in information-need templates that are able to represent patient-specific <b>information</b> <b>needs.</b> Our experiments show that a physician's <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> can be modelled adequately and can be substantiated into patient-specific <b>information</b> <b>needs.</b> Since the number of formulated <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> is rather high, future research will focus on methods that restrict the set of automatically formulated <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> to a more specialized se...|$|R

5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> {{to prove that it}} was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E
5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx {{in the case of}} HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E

At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E

These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional <b>information</b> <b>needed</b> in the quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next}} level which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key {{to the next level}}, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

40|$|Key policy drivers {{worldwide}} include optimising the patient’s role {{in managing}} their care; focusing services around patient needs and preferences to facilitate choice; and providing {{the information to}} help them make those choices. The term <b>information</b> <b>need</b> penetrates many policy documents, espoused as the foundation from which to develop patient-centred or patient led services. Yet {{there is no clear}} definition as to what the term means or how patient <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> inform and shape information provision and patient care. Theoretical Synthesis: The assimilation of complex theories originating from information science has much to offer patient <b>information</b> <b>need</b> within the context of health. This paper extends and applies knowledge of information behaviour alongside research measuring <b>information</b> <b>need</b> in health, exposing a working definition for patient <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> Reiterating the importance of considering the patient’s goals and <b>information</b> <b>need</b> in conjunction with understanding the context/situation in which they transpire. Health research often focuses on the content of information patients prefer not why they <b>need</b> <b>information.</b> A patient <b>information</b> <b>need</b> is defined as ‘recognition that their knowledge is inadequate to satisfy a goal, within the context/situation that they find themselves at a specific point in the time’. This typifies the key concepts of national/international health policy, the centrality and importance of the patient. Conclusion: The definition of patient <b>information</b> <b>need</b> provides a clear conceptual framework to guide healthcare practitioners on why and what to consider when meeting the <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> of patients in practice. This creates a solid foundation from which to inform future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine and compare the levels of care <b>information</b> <b>needs,</b> <b>information</b> preferences, unmet <b>information</b> <b>needs,</b> and predictive factors between newly diagnosed and surgically treated oral cavity cancer patients. Patients were divided into two groups comprising: (a) diagnosed patients and (b) surgically treated patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> about care, disease-/treatment-related characteristics, and physical performance function in 109 diagnosed and 113 surgically treated oral cavity cancer patients. The two groups had statistically different levels of care <b>information</b> <b>needs,</b> <b>information</b> preferences about benefits, and side effects of treatment/ surgery. There were clinically meaningful differences in their information concerns. The diagnosed patients' <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> were predicted by previous serious illness experiences, prior alcohol use, anxiety level, education level, time since diagnosis, psychological impact, and religion. The surgically treated patients' <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> were predicted by previous serious illness experiences, prior alcohol use, anxiety level, psychological impact, education level, and marital status. Conclusion: This study revealed differences in <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> between diagnosed patients and surgically treated oral cavity cancer patients.
