Images had shown jets of icy particles being emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon's south polar region. According to Andrew Ingersoll, California Institute of Technology, [...] "Other moons in the Solar System have liquid-water oceans covered by kilometers of icy crust. What's <b>different</b> <b>here</b> is that pockets of liquid water may {{be no more than}} tens of meters below the surface." [...] Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus. In May 2011, NASA scientists at an Enceladus Focus Group Conference {{reported that}} Enceladus [...] "is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it".|$|E

After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything <b>different</b> <b>here</b> than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it?" ...|$|E

500|$|The Cookbook {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 28 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rich Juzwiak of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A rating, stating [...] "Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona {{is allowed to}} wander wherever it wants on The Cookbook, be it avant or common." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote, [...] "The Cookbook is a convincing return to form.... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly not a woman to be messed with." [...] John Bush of AllMusic noted that [...] "Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop.... What's <b>different</b> <b>here</b> is how relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to simply go with what comes naturally and sounds best." [...] Q stated [...] "If not Elliott's most inventive album, The Cookbook is certainly her most colourful and entertaining".|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis {{compared}} Love This City {{to their}} previous album, [...] "this disc is less cohesive, covering {{a wide range}} of subject matter. The song style is <b>different</b> <b>here,</b> too, as Freedman allows his piano to {{take a back seat to}} guitars or brass on a number of tracks. The city of the title is Sydney, and many of these songs relate to its changing face." [...] He described [...] "You Gotta Love This City" [...] as [...] "less-than-complimentary reaction to the commercialism of the Olympic Games" [...] and [...] "Blow Up the Pokies" [...] as detailing the [...] "infiltration of gambling machines into suburban bars and clubs." [...] Nimmervoll described how the album [...] "was again recorded in a number of studios, with a changed line-up, leaning on the same and new songwriting collaborations. It couldn't match the emotional charge that came with Eternal Nightcap but did enough to ensure The Whitlams' survival." ...|$|E

"Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything <b>different</b> <b>here</b> than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|After its {{instrumental}} linking passage, the key ascends to {{its fourth}} interval. According to author Jim Fusilli: [...] "Brian came {{pretty close to}} writing himself into a dead end. There's really nowhere to go {{coming out of the}} bridge, which modulates to G major from D major but ends with a D major–A major–B minor pattern. Thus, when the song returns to D Major, it must do so from B minor, which is kind of a static change, particularly when the next chord is a B minor with only a slight variation in the bass." [...] Along with the 8+4 measure verse/chorus scheme, Downes called the idea of a [...] "bridge section in a related key" [...] standard for rock/pop music, but adds: [...] "What is <b>different</b> <b>here,</b> however, is how the move to the subdominant in the bridge conditions the tonal behavior of the entire song, which, though nominally in E Major, is characterized throughout by a tension between it and A major." [...] The [...] "choral fantasy" [...] during this key change eventually concludes that [...] "a clear sense has eluded us for the entire experience–that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted", in Lambert's opinion.|$|E

2500|$|Due to its ethnic {{diversity}} {{and the existence}} of different languages and religious observations (Sunni and Shi'a), the musical tradition of Khorasan is very rich. From the north to the south, the music scene varies greatly. In the north of Khorasan, one can find the bakhshi narrating and singing, among other things, [...] "daastans" [...] (stories in old Persian), although they can also sing in Kurdish about the historical deeds of local figures. They accompany themselves on the dotar. A leading exponent of this type is the late Haj Ghorban Soleimani. One can also find in the north, the Asheq who play [...] "dohol" [...] (double-faced drum), the [...] "sorna" [...] (a kind of oboe-like reed instrument) and the [...] "qoshme" [...] (double clarinet made of the central nervure of the plumage of birds tied together). The Asheq are specifically associated with the Kurds and play at wedding dances and village feasts. In the East of Khorasan, near Torbat Jam, the main instrument is the dotar with some modifications, but there are no Bakhshi and the music is <b>different.</b> <b>Here,</b> the music takes the form of [...] "ghazal khani'" [...] and is performed by singers of quatrains and [...] "ghazals" [...] – lyric poems based on the invocations of mystic poets like Rumi, Attar and Sheikh Ahmad Jami. Purely instrumental pieces also figure in the repertoire.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{and simple}} penannular {{brooches}} in bronze, iron, and, rarely, silver were {{common in the}} Roman period as a practical fastener, but were not used for high-status objects, and any decoration was normally limited to bands around the ring or other simple patterns. Often the extra thickness at the terminal, necessary to prevent the pin just falling off, is achieved simply by turning back {{the ends of the}} ring. In the late Roman period in Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries, a type of penannular brooch with zoomorphic decoration to the terminals appeared, with human or animal heads, still not much wider {{than the rest of the}} ring. [...] Some examples had enamel decoration, and the pin did not extend much beyond the ring. [...] These are found especially in southwestern Britain and Wales, and seem to have developed in these areas. This type fell from favour in southern Britain by the 5th century, but was developed in Ireland by the 6–7th centuries. These types considerably extended the size of the terminals, which now presented a flattish area often decorated with enamel or glass inlay, mostly using abstracted patterns but sometimes zoomorphic decoration. The length of the pin is now often about twice the diameter of the ring. [...] The Irish cultural zone in this period included much of Western Scotland, and in Pictish East Scotland a similar development took place, though the forms are somewhat <b>different</b> <b>here.</b> The decoration paralleled that on other metalwork fittings such as pieces of harness-tackle, and the few remaining early Christian reliquaries and other pieces of church metalwork.|$|E
