5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a national icon.|$|E
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a national myth to Americans as a people. This {{is also the case}} for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Macandal {{is a black}} slave, first {{introduced}} on the same plantation as Ti Noel. He is admired for his qualities that are irresistible to black women {{and his ability to}} captivate men. He regales tales of great kingdoms and speaks of epic battles in which the animals were allies of men, of the incarnation of the serpent, of a queen who was the Rainbow, and of horses adorned with silver coins. Macandal has his left arm amputated after a machinery accident on the plantation of Lenormand de Mezy and, unable to complete heavy work, is put in charge of pasturing the cattle. He departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi about which he is taught more by an old, mysterious woman who <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a witch. Macandal leaves the plantation, attains the ability to transform into various beings, and is represented as having superhuman powers due to his possession by the gods.|$|E

5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E

25|$|Eric Nicol's Dickens of the Mounted, {{a fictional}} {{biography}} of Francis Jeffrey Dickens, {{the real life}} third son of novelist Charles Dickens who joined the North-West Mounted Police in 1874, has an alternative and less than flattering take on Flashman—the book itself <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a homage to the Flashman series.|$|E
25|$|The term “flat bone” <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> {{a misnomer}} because, {{although}} a flat bone is typically thin, {{it is also}} often curved. Examples include the cranial (skull) bones, the scapulae (shoulder blades), the sternum (breastbone), and the ribs. Flat bones serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs. Flat bones {{do not have a}} medullary cavity because they are thin.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even with}} the aid of a debugger, {{locating}} bugs <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an art. It is not uncommon for a bug in one section of a program to cause failures in a completely different section, thus making it especially difficult to track (for example, an error in a graphics rendering routine causing a file I/O routine to fail), in an apparently unrelated part of the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of all morphisms from X to Y is denoted homC(X,Y) or simply hom(X, Y) {{and called the}} hom-set between X and Y. Some authors write MorC(X,Y), Mor(X, Y) or C(X, Y). Note that the term hom-set <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a misnomer as the {{collection of}} morphisms {{is not required to}} be a set. A category where hom(X, Y) is a set for all objects X and Y is called locally small.|$|E
25|$|Gillespie County <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an {{aberration}} {{in that it}} is a historically Republican county in a state that was overwhelmingly Democratic up until recent decades. This is largely due to the heavily German American heritage of the county and that Gillespie was the centre of Texas’ small Unionist movement during the Civil War, when most Texas Germans acquiesced to secession but Fredericksburg was still self-sufficient and sold surplus food to the army.|$|E

25|$|Chris <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a weakling {{who often}} finds himself getting in {{difficult}} situations, usually over women. When {{he goes to}} the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, a lie that causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill them all.|$|E
25|$|Father Zosima, the Elder Father Zosima is an Elder {{and spiritual}} advisor (starets) {{in the town}} monastery and Alyosha's teacher. He <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a celebrity among the townspeople for his reputed prophetic and healing abilities. His {{popularity}} inspires both admiration and jealousy amidst his fellow monks. Zosima provides a refutation to Ivan's atheistic arguments and helps to explain Alyosha's character. Zosima's teachings shape the way Alyosha deals with the young boys he meets in the Ilyusha storyline.|$|E
25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.|$|E

25|$|Jade : is {{the most}} common material, and is {{associated}} with the most common, least powerful of the Exalted, the Terrestrial Exalted. There are six different colors of jade, five of which correspond to one of the Elemental Dragons. Blue jade resonates with Air, white with Earth, black with Water, green with Wood, and red with Fire. The sixth, yellow jade, <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a mystery, in that it should not exist and only comes about through alchemical mistakes. Jade weapons are unnaturally fast, and jade armor doesn't tire the wearer.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the /w/ offglide is only {{believed}} to have existed in */aw/ and */uw/ resulting in the MSB o-class vowels /ɔ/ and /o/ respectively. The absence of */iw/ and */ow/ in reconstructions <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a mystery, however it is possible that, by analogy with the /j/ offglide, */aw/ */iw/ */ow/ */uw/ all existed, resulting in pairs {{with or without the}} rounded on-glide: /ɔ/ /o/ /u̯ɔ/ /u̯o/ which later merged. This may explain why the Burmese orthography indicates the vowel /o/ with both the diacritics for both the /i/ and /u/ vowels and, previously, a following consonantal /w/.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
