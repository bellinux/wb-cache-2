There is a more typical secondary entrance building, directly opposite, on the west side of Spadina Road.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of urinary macromolecules of nucleating calcium oxalate crystallites {{trapped in a}} matrix was studied in an agarose gel medium. The mean inhibitory activity (I) of concentrated whole urine (1, 200 mOsmol/kg) differentiates the population into two groups: a high activity groups (H, 63 % of stone formers, 23 % of normal controls; I = 0. 64) and a low activity group (L, 37 % of stone <b>formers,</b> <b>77</b> % of normal controls: I = 0. 27). Urinary macromolecules concentrated by ultrafiltration at a nominal cutoff of 5 kDa resulted in increased crystallization. This contrasts with the purely inhibitory activity of the dextrans. The overall crystallization activity of whole urine is due therefore to the composite action of inhibiting as well as enhancing factors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Streetcars exiting the loop can turn northbound on Spadina, or southbound on Spadina to reach Queens Quay eastbound or westbound.Although not currently used by buses, this loop was the terminus for the <b>former</b> route <b>77</b> Spadina bus until 1997. The loop was demolished in 2013 and finished rebuilt in 2015 as part of the Queens Quay Revitalization Project.|$|R

In 1937, SR 637 was extended north of McConnelsville along a previously un-numbered roadway up to a new northern terminus at SR 340 in the hamlet of Ruraldale. [...] By 1964, SR 340 was truncated to its current western terminus at SR 284. The portion east of SR 376 would become known as county-maintained Ruraldale Road, while the portion to the west would become an extension of SR 376 that would take it to its current northern terminus at SR 60 in Blue Rock.|$|R

Rich left for Nottingham at this time, {{and was replaced by}} Martyn Peck (aka 'Roki', ex-Optimum Wound Profile, Red Flag 77, Whiteslug, Raw Noise). This marked a significant shift in the band's sound. The original streetpunk style favoured by The Ballistics was slowly replaced by a sound more reminiscent of ska punk.|$|R
2500|$|The TTC {{returned}} to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from Union Station, travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on Queen's Quay (along {{the edge of}} Lake Ontario) {{to the foot of}} Spadina Avenue. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at Spadina Station. [...] At this time, the route was renamed 510 Spadina to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the <b>former</b> route <b>77</b> Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north-south transit service through Toronto's Chinatown and the western boundary of University of Toronto's main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing Bathurst route, providing for a new 509 Harbourfront route from Union Station to the refurbished Exhibition Loop at the Exhibition grounds, where the Canadian National Exhibition is held.|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, {{explosion}} {{of knowledge and}} internet access seriously challenged the traditional language {{of teaching and learning}} methodologies. Most teachers and experts recognize the need for a teaching method using Information & Communication Technology (ICT) facilities. Purpose: To assess and compare the students' English for Specialized Purpose (E. S. P.) learning in two approaches of traditional text-based and internet–based articles. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 60 second-year students of medicine having ESP course. They were assigned into two groups based on their average scores: one group attended a class of which materials were chosen from the latest published medical articles in internet and the other attended a traditional text-based class. Care was taken to select texts of the same level of legibility. The language proficiency of the students was measured by English Language Battery Test (ELBA Test). Results: The students achieved better results with internet-based medical English articles, compared to the traditional text-based method.

5000|$|When the Korean War broke out, No. 77 Squadron was self-supporting. The added {{burden of}} combat {{operations}} made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, {{leading to the}} formation of No. 391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No. 91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by <b>former</b> No. <b>77</b> Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No. 391 Squadron had to contend with severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose following the introduction of the Meteor, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. Along with its RAAF responsibilities, No. 391 Squadron supported Australian Army and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni. It ran No. 91 Wing's [...] "Transit Hotel", which accommodated business people and entertainers, as well as military personnel. The squadron's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations.|$|R
