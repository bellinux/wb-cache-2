40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to validate the}} widely held assumption that a course at a Ministry of Labour <b>Industrial</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Unit</b> may improve attitudes in clients. In order to do this, relevant attitudes had to be identified and suitable means of assessing them provided. As {{a result of a}} pilot study two major attitudes, ' Inadequacy' and 'Keenness for Work' were identified. The hypotheses were set up that a reduction in Inadequacy would occur during industrial rehabilitation, but that Keenness for Work would remain unchanged. Attitude scales were developed to measure Inadequacy and Keenness for Work. Both achieved an acceptable level of reliability and validity. An attempt to use a check list for attitude assessment proved unsuccessful. A shortened form of the Maudsley Personality Inventory was used to help in the interpretation of the other measures and to test the subsidiary hypotheses that a reduction in neuroticism but no change in extraversion would occur during rehabilitation. All measures were administered to 327 male rehabilitees {{in the first week of}} their course, and again to the 214 of these still available in the sixth week. Results supported all hypotheses. Further analysis of the data indicated that Keenness for Work was related to employment status six months later, age, and amount of family responsibility. Inadequacy was related to psychiatric classification. Neither attitude was related to reason for terminating the course, or to length of unemployment. Factor analysis of scale items suggested that nine factors might be involved in the attitudes considered. Results are discussed in relation to the needs and problems of attitude research in industrial rehabilitation, and suggestions for further research are given...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} and non-clinical factors involved in decision-making concerning admission to European stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> DESIGN: Observational study on case-mix at intake combined with questionnaires and semi-structured {{interviews with the}} medical consultants of each European stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit.</b> PATIENTS AND SETTINGS: Clinical data on 532 first-ever patients after stroke. Medical consultants from 6 European stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units</b> in 4 European countries (UK, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland). METHODS: Standardized clinical assessments within 2 days after admission. Questionnaires to each medical consultants followed by a qualitative round of semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Case-mix of patients after stroke was significantly different between European stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> Clinical criteria for admission were seldom explicit and were evaluated differently between the European stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units.</b> In the UK units, diagnosis of stroke was the only criterion for admission. In the Belgian, German and Swiss units, pre-morbid conditions were {{taken into account in}} admission decisions. The likelihood of discharge home was considered highly important in the Swiss units. CONCLUSION: Case-mix differences at intake could be linked to different appraisals of clinical and non-clinical factors of patients after stroke. The findings urge us to be more explicit about decision-making processes at admission in order to provide a more comprehensive insight into the interplay between context and process of care. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{predict the}} {{requirement}} for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit</b> after acute care hospitalization for stroke: how many and which type of rehabilitation unit?PopulationData {{were obtained from the}} Rhône-Alpes inpatient database in Acute Care and Rehabilitation. All acute care hospitalization for stroke in Rhône-Alpes region where considered. MethodFive groups of acute stroke inpatient where determined according to the type of discharge required (rehabilitation, nursing home or home…) applying recommendation of the French Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (Sofmer). These groups were determined analyzing information contained in database (age, comorbidity, medical procedure, wards…). For each of the 5 groups, the type of discharge required was compared with the real discharge of the patient. When patients were admitted in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units,</b> logistic regression model was used to analyze effect of the type of <b>rehabilitation</b> (neurological <b>unit</b> or no) on dependence score improvement. Results(1)  Type of discharge required: among the 7511 discharges of surviving acute stroke, 858 (11 %) had no indication for rehabilitation and should be supported in nursing home, 389 (5 %) had very serious clinical conditions and required specialized post-acute care <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>units,</b> 1255 (17 %) required an hospitalization in general or geriatric <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit</b> because of their bad prognosis factors of functional outcome and 1865 (25 %) required a PMR unit. (2)  When hospitalization in a PMR unit was required, 896 (48 %) were actually admitted in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>unit,</b> of which 703 in PMR. Those admitted in PMR had a greater probability of functional improvement compared with no neurological unit (aOR= 1. 64 [1. 09 – 2. 46]) after adjustment for age, comorbidity, initial level of dependence, and the duration of hospitalization.
