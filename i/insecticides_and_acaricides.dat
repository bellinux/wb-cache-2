A new biological control strategy in tomato crop is studied in our center which consists of using only predators and parasitoids instead of <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides.</b> But it could be that this reduction of pesticides - only fungicides are still necessary - has some impact on aerial fungi development and thus makes it necessary {{to increase the number of}} treatments against these. To test this assumption we have grown tomatoes in glasshouses that were divided into two identical parts so that a classical control by use of acaricides and insecticides is applied in one part and a biological control, only by release of natural auxiliaries in the other. The development in the crop of powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) and grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) was determined in the two cases in view of the fact that an equal number of treatments against these fungi was applied on both sides. As a result we observe a more extent development of these fungi in the crop where biological pest control is applied. It would appear that <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> have an effect on these fungi and their application would reduce these fungal diseases problems in a crop.

Effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) is essential if the utility of current and future insecticides is to be preserved.

IRAC serves as the Specialist Technical Group within CropLife International focused on ensuring the long term efficacy of insect, mite and tick control products through effective resistance management for sustainable agriculture and improved public health. A key function of IRAC is the continued development of the Mode of Action (MoA) classification scheme, which provides up-to-date information on the modes of action of new and established <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> and which serves {{as the basis for}} developing appropriate IRM strategies for crop protection and vector control.

40|$|<b>Insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> {{designed}} to control primary harmful {{insects and mites}} may also variously affect some other arthopods present in an (agro) ecosystem (e. g. secondary pests, predators, parasitoids, saprophytes, bioindicators, pollinators). Apart from <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides,</b> arthropods may also {{be affected by the}} activity of other pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, etc.). Regardless of whether they are deemed desirable or not, the effects that pesticides have on arthopods need to be quantified as closely as possible through appropriate experimental procedures. Data acquired in tests {{designed to}} determined LD 50 /LC 50 values are inadequate for evaluation of pesticide effectiveness in the field as pesticidesalso cause various sublethal effects, generally disregarded in such investigations. The sublethal effects of pesticides refer to any altered behaviour and/or physiology of individuals that have survived exposure to pesticides at doses/concentrations that can be lethal(within range causing mortality in an experimental population that exceeds mortality in an untreated population) or sublethal (below that range). Pesticides affect locomotion and mobility, stimulate dispersion of arthropods from treated areas, complicate or prevent their navigation, orientation and ability to locate hosts, and cause changes in their feeding, mating and egg-laying patterns. Sublethal pesticide effects on arthropod physiology reflect on the life span, rate of development, fecundity and/or fertility, sex ratio and immunity of surviving individuals. Different parameters are being used in arthropod bioassays to determine sublethal effects (ED 50 /EC 50, LOEC, NOEC, total effect index). Compared to acute toxicity tests, these parameters improve the quality of evaluation and create a more accurate view of the effects of a pesticide. However, such approach covers mainly fecundity/fertility alone, while all other sublethal effects remain unaccounted for. Besides, it refers to an evaluation of individuals, rather than populations, and it is the latter that are required for a more reliable evaluation of effectiveness of pesticides in real life. A demographic-toxicologicalapproach has been proposed therefore as a way of integrating the effects that a toxicant may cause at population level, which includes the construction of life tables and computation of population growth parameters, including intrinsic rate of increase (rm) as a crucialparameter. Compared to other laboratory toxicity tests, the demographic-toxicological bioassay has been found superior in terms of a capacity to evaluate overall effects of pesticides, and such approach in evaluating pesticide effects is crucial for environmentally-based programmes of integrated plant protection and a competent evaluation of ecotoxicological risks of pesticide applications...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStructurally diverse {{synthetic}} <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> {{had been}} shown to inhibit the proton-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) activity. In addition, secondary metabolites from microbial and plant sources known to act on complex I exhibited biological activity against agricultural and environmental insect pests. Mechanistic studies indicated that these compounds interfered with ubiquinone reduction most likely at the same site(s) as the classical complex I inhibitors rotenone and piericidin A. Two approaches to characterize the mechanism of insecticidal/acaricidal complex I inhibitors were followed: enzyme kinetic studies and binding studies with radiolabeled inhibitors. Enzyme kinetic experiments were sometimes controversially interpreted regarding a competitive or non-competitive inhibitor mechanism {{with respect to the}} electron acceptor. In general, radioligand binding data with submitochondrial membranes were in line with the enzymological results but due to methodological drawbacks, saturation kinetic analyses were impossible. The main problems underlying many studies of inhibitor interaction with complex I were (i) the use of membrane-bound enzyme preparations and (ii) the physicochemical properties of the amphiphilic inhibitors with their strong tendency to accumulate in the membrane phase. A more recent approach to characterize inhbibitor interaction sites in complex I was the isolation of piericidin-resistant mutants of photosynthetic bacteria which produce a simpler homologue of mitochondrial NADH:Q oxidoreductase...|$|E

The two partial reactions, carboxylation of biotin followed by carboxyl {{transfer to the}} acceptor acetyl-CoA, are performed by two separate domains in animal ACCs. The cyclic keto-enol <b>insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> have been proposed to inhibit insect ACCs. In this communication, we show that the enol derivative of the cylic keto-enol insecticide spirotetramat inhibited ACCs partially purified from the insect species Myzus persicae and Spodoptera frugiperda, {{as well as the}} spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) ACC which was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed competitive inhibition with respect to the carboxyl acceptor, acetyl-CoA, indicating that spirotetramat-enol bound to the carboxyltransferase domain of ACC. Interestingly, inhibition with respect to the biotin carboxylase substrate ATP was uncompetitive. Amino acid residues in the carboxyltransferase domains of plant ACCs are important for binding of established herbicidal inhibitors. Mutating the spider mite ACC at the homologous positions, for example L 1736 to either isoleucine or alanine, and A 1739 to either valine or serine, did not affect the inhibition of the spider mite ACC by spirotetramat-enol.

30|$|Pesticides {{are widely}} used within the industrialized {{agriculture}} {{as shown by the}} great amounts that are worldwide applied (ca. 395, 944.4  t a− 1 in Europe 2014 —Eurostats, Pesticide sales Reg. 1185 / 2009, [54]). The majority of the applied pesticides in Europe are fungicides and bactericides (44 %) followed by herbicides (33 %). <b>Insecticides</b> <b>and</b> <b>acaricides</b> still share 5 % of the total amount, which corresponds to 20, 706.3  t a− 1 in entire Europe in 2014. In spite of intensified efforts in terms of regulation and technological advances for environmental risk mitigation, recent studies revealed that pesticides still massively contribute to the toxicity to non-target organisms within surface waters in Europe [37, 53]. Regular monitoring programs of surface waters revealed thereby that pesticides do not occur equally during the year, but appear to specific seasons, which, of course, correlates with respective agricultural activities. In late summer to autumn, primarily herbicides are used in terms of pre harvest application (siccation), post-harvest preparation, pre emergence treatment, as well as for weed treatment within the crops. In spring and early summer, predominantly insecticides are used to control emerging insect pests. Therefore, non-target organisms within the aquatic environment are regularly exposed to different pesticides during respective developmental stages of their life cycle. Consequently, the seasonal exposure pattern may cause harmful effects either directly or indirectly, which pose a specific risk for insects with uni- or paravoltine lifecycles in the aquatic environment.|$|E
