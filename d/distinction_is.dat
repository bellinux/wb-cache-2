5|$|Since yttrium is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower atomic mass.|$|E

5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E

5|$|The Draped Bust {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1795 to 1803, and was reproduced, dated 1804, into the 1850s. The design succeeded the Flowing Hair dollar, which began mintage in 1794 {{and was the}} first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint. The {{designer}} is unknown, though the <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> usually credited to artist Gilbert Stuart. The model is also unknown, though Ann Willing Bingham has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> {{the number}} of {{chambers}} in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. Although {{there is a greater}} mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E

5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by year of completion, the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E
5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> {{made between the}} conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena. The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, Crocodilia/Crocodylia was a {{group that}} {{encompassed}} the modern-day animals (the crown group) {{as well as their}} more distant relatives now in the larger groups called Crocodylomorpha and Pseudosuchia. Under its current definition Crocodylia is restricted to only the most recent ancestor of today's modern-day crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials). This <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> more important for paleontologists studying crocodilian evolution. As such, the alternate spellings Crocodilia and Crocodylia are still used interchangeably in the neontological literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} colonies can be culturally {{divided between}} the uplands and the lowlands, and this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> seen in diet and food preparation in the two regions. The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it {{was used in the}} preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

5|$|W. & S. B. Ives {{published}} {{the game in}} the United States in Salem, Massachusetts on November 24, 1843. It was republished by Parker Brothers in 1894 after George S. Parker & Co. bought the rights to the Ives games. The republication claimed The Mansion of Happiness was the first board game published in the United States of America; today, however, the <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> awarded to Lockwood's Traveller's Tour games of 1822. The popularity of The Mansion of Happiness and similar moralistic board games was challenged in the last decades of the 19th century when the focus of games became materialistic and competitive capitalistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
