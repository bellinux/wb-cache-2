Wade Cunningham, Wheldon's teammate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 17 Dallara, clipped James Hinchcliffe, driving the No. 06 Dallara, and then made contact with J. R. Hildebrand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Dallara. Then Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car, causing his to go airborne. Cunningham collected Jay Howard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 15 Dallara {{on the inside and}} then Townsend Bell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 22 Dallara on the outside before colliding with the retaining wall.

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of one minute and 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and drove back to the pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of one minute and 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes.

Basic synecologic characteristics (dominance, {{species diversity}}, evenness and Jaccard similarity index) were evaluated.
