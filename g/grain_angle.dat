40|$|Poor shape {{stability}} of sawn softwood timber, causes substantial economic losses for sawmills {{and the building}} industry. Sawn timber twist is regarded {{to be the most}} severe deformation and {{has been shown to be}} controlled by intrinsic wood properties like wood shrinkage and spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle.</b> The aim of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate the possibility to improve sawn timber shape stability, by genetic selection of genotypes of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) with a favourable spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle.</b> Genetic parameters were estimated for the spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> in the mature wood of trees in four progeny trials (age 27 – 36 years) and two clonal trials (age 19 years) of Norway spruce. In addition, in a 36 -year-old Scots pine progeny trial, the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was measured and shape stability traits of the boards sawn from sampled trees were assessed. The estimates of genetic standard deviation (0. 7 °– 0. 9 °) and heritability (0. 29 – 0. 42) in the mature wood of both species suggested that <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> could be altered by genetic selection. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> measured in single annual rings of Scots pine showed substantial phenotypic correlations (0. 54 – 0. 70) with the twist of small sawn timber dried to a 12 % moisture content. As an example, twist could potentially be reduced by 0. 3 °– 0. 7 ° by selecting 20 % of the parents displaying the lowest <b>grain</b> <b>angle,</b> thereby appreciably decreasing the percentage of excessively twisted boards. <b>Grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark exhibited non-significant genetic correlations, close to zero, with growth traits, stem form, and branch traits in both species, and with pilodyn penetration in Norway spruce, suggesting that genetic selection for this trait would not generate any appreciable response in the other traits. The results of the studies imply that the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> measured under bark is utilisable in terms of genetic parameter estimation and for predicting the twist propensity of small sawn timber. This suggests that there is potential to improve sawn timber shape stability by genetic selection for a lower <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark and thus reducing the twist of sawn timber...|$|E

40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{construction}} material that is used in many contexts, and for different purposes. Serious problems may arise, however, when moisture related deformations as twist occur in wood used in different types of building structures, joinery and furniture. Twist can be explained to a great degree by the helical deviation of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> {{in relation to the}} longitudinal direction of the log or the sawn board. Wood fibres form a spiral within the tree, and this is a natural occurrence that is named spiral grain. The wood fibres close to the pith in Norway spruce form a left-handed spiral. In most trees the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> turns over to be right-handed with time. Sawn timber that exhibits large grain angles lead to problems of shape stability and stiffness in finished constructions. In this thesis the spiral grain in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was stated as well as the effect on sawn timber. The material was based on sample trees from Sweden and Finland. Samples were taken in twenty-two stands at different heights in tree. From six stands studs were sawn and dried for measuring twist and other deformations. The spiral grain was measured with the method scribe test on 390 log discs taken at the top-end of the logs. Account was given concerning changes in <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> from pith to bark, regarding both increasing annual ring numbers and distance from pith. The development of <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> over tree age was utilized to study whether annual growth, size of tree, height in tree as well as silvicultural treatments affected spiral grain. Moreover, the relation between <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and distance to pith (in mm) was used to forecast twist in sawn timber. The left-handed <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was at its greatest between the fourth and eighth annual rings. Thereafter for most trees the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> turned from left-handed to right-handed in a linear fashion, in a manner that was unique for each individual tree. The pattern of spiral grain differed significantly between different stands, regarding change of inclination with increasing age or distance from pith. The culmination of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> close to the pith occurred at somewhat higher age higher up in the trunk. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> decreased faster in top logs than it did in the butt logs. The largest trees within a stand had a <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> that turned to right in a slower way than smaller ones. The thinning strength and type of thinning regime also affected the character of spiral grain in the remaining trees in a stand. There was an indication that strong thinnings, where fast growing trees are retained, may lead to more individuals in a stand that exhibit high grain angles under bark. With knowledge of the size and direction of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark, and the diameter of the log, calculations can be made that show how twisted the sawn timber will be after drying. This can be used for deciding whether an individual log can profitably be sawn and processed further or not. The <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> under bark can be used to remove trees showing the greatest degree of spiral grain already in the first thinning. Silvicultural methods aiming at even and dense Norway spruce stands, which normally is practised in Scandinavia, will probably result in timber with relatively low risk concerning large <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and subsequent risk for twist in sawn wood...|$|E
30|$|Off-axis tensile creep {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on woods taken from Japanese cypress and Kalopanax by changing the angle of load to the grain direction in the longitudinal–tangential (LT) plane. The dependence of the Poisson’s ratio and trend of the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio on <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> were investigated. The Poisson’s ratios were found to reach their extrema when the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was around 30 °. Moreover, the Poisson’s ratio in the LT plane was observed to be negative when the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was {{in the range of}} 15 °– 45 °. Comparing the experimental results with theoretical values obtained from the theory of orthotropic elasticity, it was revealed that, although the Poisson’s ratio reached an extremum in both cases, the specific values did not match, especially when the angle was between 15 ° and 45 °. Furthermore, the temporal variation of the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio was found to depend on the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and the measurement plane. It also appeared to be affected by the Poisson’s ratio, showing an increasing tendency above a specific Poisson’s ratio (Japanese cypress: 0.196, Kalopanax: 0.102) and a decreasing tendency below it, regardless of the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> and measurement plane. Additionally, the increment in the viscoelastic Poisson’s ratio after 24  h of creep was observed to reach its extremum when the <b>grain</b> <b>angle</b> was around 30 °.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method, called the CT-direction method, {{in which the}} fiber directions in wood in three-dimensional space are calculated from the pixel information {{on a series of}} two-dimensional computed tomography images. Local fiber directions are calculated from the principal directions of inertia of measurement spheres distributed throughout the body of the wood object. The calculated fiber directions are probably due to density streaks in the material, such as fiber bundles, which are directed in the fiber direction, and not the density of individual fibers, which are too small to be detected. The fiber directions vary locally, and density streaks from knots, growth rings, and compression wood influence the results, which adds spread to the results. The fiber directions are presented as spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> and conical angles and are compared with spiral <b>grain</b> <b>angles</b> measured with the tracheid-effect method.
