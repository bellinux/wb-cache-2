5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process. Andy does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

25|$|Gudea's {{appearance}} is recognizable today {{because he had}} numerous statues or idols, depicting him with unprecedented, lifelike realism, placed in temples throughout Sumer. Gudea took advantage of artistic development because he evidently wanted posterity to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> looked like. And in that he has succeeded—a feat available to him as royalty, {{but not to the}} common people who could not afford to have statues engraved of themselves.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, Sin Cara {{participated in}} the Money in the Bank ladder match at the eponymous pay-per-view, but failed to earn a World Heavyweight Championship match after being {{taken out of the}} match with a storyline injury.

25|$|Kotarō (actually Benten Kozō in disguise) then appears with an {{attendant}} (his fellow thief, Nangō Rikimaru in disguise), {{and the couple}} go into a nearby teahouse on the grounds; Senju has never before met Kotarō, and so {{has no reason to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should look like. Meanwhile, Akaboshi Jūzaburō, another thief, attempting to swindle money intended for the memorial service from members of Senju's party, is discovered. A scuffle erupts, and the group rush to the teahouse, where Benten Kozō is attempting to obtain from Senju a valuable gold incense burner which was a gift to her from Kotarō's family. Tadanobu Rihei, yet another thief, disguised as an anonymous ronin, drives them away, and defuses the situation.|$|E

25|$|In 1921 the Chief Scout of Switzerland, Walther von Bonstetten, visited Kandersteg {{on holiday}} {{and found an}} old empty chalet. It was built in 1908 to house the {{construction}} workers for the Lötschberg Tunnel. In 1913, when the tunnel was finished, the chalet was left unused by the railway company. Von Bonstetten felt that this location could be the permanent international meeting place that Robert Baden-Powell had in mind where Scouts {{from all over the}} world could meet. Von Bonstetten wrote to him to let him <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had found. The response was positive and on 12 February 1923 the Scouts International Home Association was set up; on 12 April 1923 the chalet and adjacent land were bought for CHF 15,100, and the International Scout Centre came into existence. In 1930 Baden-Powell visited the site himself.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{continues}} {{the story of}} the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in {{what appears to be a}} young boy who doesn't exactly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.|$|E

[...] Alonso's departure from McLaren after driving for the British team in 2007 had been acrimonious, and Alonso's dislike for the rookie Hamilton was well documented. Talking about Hamilton's penalty in Japan, Alonso said [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, but it's good he's punished anyway." [...] Hamilton refused {{to be drawn into}} the controversy: [...] "I don't particularly have an opinion on it," [...] he said, adding that he was interested only in his own race.|$|E

500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E
500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] was Joss Whedon's {{first attempt}} at writing music, which he {{had always wanted to}} do. He learned how to play guitar to write several songs. Christophe Beck, a regular {{composer}} for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed [...] "Dawn's Ballet". Whedon is a fan of Stephen Sondheim, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode's ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, [...] "Some of Joss' music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it's a Beatles thing. He doesn't know enough to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can't do and he's smashing rules." ...|$|E

500|$|The engine overhaul, and the {{replacement}} of a damaged topmast, delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant {{that it was no}} longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to Grytviken harbour in South Georgia. Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia. He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, [...] "The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will do." ...|$|E
