40|$|Synopsis: Both {{short and}} {{long-term}} performances of repaired or strengthened concrete structures using external FRP bonding are greatly affected by states of bonding substrates, which are covercrete and may have experienced various damages. One of them is <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in cold regions. This paper intends to investigate how the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damages</b> in concrete influence the static and fatigue bond performances of CFRP/concrete interfaces. Concrete specimens were exposed to freeze and thaw cycles before being bonded with CFRP sheets. The initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> of concrete was controlled approximately at three different levels {{in terms of its}} relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, which was 100 % (non <b>frost</b> <b>damage),</b> 85 % and 70 %, respectively. Test results showed that failure modes of CFRP/concrete bonded joints with initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in concrete were the delamination of covercrete. By contrast the joints without initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> failed in a thin concrete layer as usual. Moreover, CFRP/concrete joints with and without initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> showed different manners in their interface bonding strength and stiffness. If the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> existed in concrete substrate the effective bond length of CFRP/concrete joints was increased due to the decrease of the bonding stiffness and interfacial fracture energy. Fatigue testing results indicated that the linear slopes of S-N curves of CFRP/concrete bonded joints were not influenced by the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> The initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> did not shorten the fatigue life of CFRP/concrete joints if a same relative tensile stress level was kept in the FRP sheets, where the relative tensile stress level was defined as a ratio of the applied tensile force in FRP sheets for the fatigue tests to the maximum static pullout one achieved in each test series...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a comprehensive method to quantify <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk in different sweet cherry production areas of South Patagonia and to estimate the potential impact of frost control systems on risk reduction. Lack of historical weather data required a theoretical-empirical approach. <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> for any specific day of the season was assumed to occur when the minimum temperature on that day was below the specific lethal temperature for the phenological stage predicted at that moment (based on phenological models). <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> probability was estimated for each production location of South Patagonia as the frequency of seasons in which at least one <b>damaging</b> <b>frost</b> (<b>damaging</b> 90 % of the reproductive organs) occurs, at any time during the growing season until harvest. <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk was compared among cultivars and locations. Finally, the effect of active frost control methods on <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk reduction was analyzed. There was very little difference in <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk among cultivars, although 'Sunburst' was the cultivar with the lowest risk. The most risky locations were Los Antiguos and Esquel, while Comodoro Rivadavia was the safest location. The frequency of years with at least one killing frost decreased dramatically when the minimum temperature was increased by 3 Â°C, using active frost control systems. The methodology presented appears useful to identify the main and secondary variables affecting <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk. Thus, this type of quantitative analysis can support growers in decision-making on required investments and operational costs of the equipment for frost control, on the basis of potential impact of a particular control system on mean yields and yield stability. It may also be a guide to prioritise research issues to fill knowledge-gaps with regard to frost risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|In Kitami City, Hokkaido, cracks {{have been}} found in bricks, {{seemingly}} due to <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> {{have been found}}. In this research, we considered three different mechanisms of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> such as <b>frost</b> heave phenomenon, one-dimensional freeze-thaw phenomenon, and closed-type freeze-thaw phenomenon. We conducted frost heave experiment and two kinds of laboratory freeze-thaw experiments in order to verify the actual mechanism of the formation of the cracks in the bricks. From the experimental results, it has been confirmed that frost heave phenomenon does not occur in bricks and that cracks does not occur in bricks due to simple one-dimensional freeze-thaw phenomenon. In addition, if bricks do not melt completely during repeated freezing leaving some frozen parts and then the bricks refreeze, the melted parts refreeze surrounded by the frozen parts and cracks then appear in the bricks.

40|$|Fall <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is a {{major threat}} to maize (Zea mays L.) seed {{production}} in the central United States. Frost events prior to harvest can cause various physical, mechanical, biochemical, and physiological changes to immature seed corn. These changes can lead to decreased germination and vigor. Early detection of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> could reduce the financial loss caused by poor emergence when these seed lots are planted. The central hypotheses of this dissertation are that the severity of a frost event can be quantified shortly after seed has been harvested and dried, and that the magnitude of the damage is associated with seed development and genetic background of the seed. This information can be used to predict field emergence of frosted seed lots. Many different aspects of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> have been explored in this project, which provides several methods for identifying <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in maize seed.

40|$|Concrete {{undergoing}} early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in {{cold weather}} will experience significant loss of not only strength, but also of permeability and durability. Accordingly, concrete codes like ACI- 306 R prescribe a minimum compressive strength and duration of curing to prevent <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> {{at an early age}} and secure the quality of concrete. Such minimum compressive strength and duration of curing are mostly defined based on the strength development of concrete. However, concrete subjected to <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> at early age may not show a consistent relationship between its strength and durability. Especially, since durability of concrete is of utmost importance in nuclear power plant structures, this relationship should be imperatively clarified. Therefore, this study verifies the feasibility of the minimum compressive strength specified in the codes like ACI- 306 R by evaluating the strength development and the durability preventing the <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> of early age concrete for nuclear power plant. The results indicate that the value of 5 MPa specified by the concrete standards like ACI- 306 R as the minimum compressive strength to prevent the early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is reasonable in terms of the strength development, but seems to be inappropriate in the viewpoint of the resistance to chloride ion penetration and freeze-thaw. Consequently, it is recommended to propose a minimum compressive strength preventing early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in terms of not only the strength development, but also in terms of the durability to secure the quality of concrete for nuclear power plants in cold climates...|$|R

The degree of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> to prairie plants was recorded using a scale of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> based on visual criteria, and possible causes of variation in frost susceptibility were examined.

However, plants that allocated a greater proportion of biomass to leaves were more severely damaged than plants which allocated less biomass to leaves.
