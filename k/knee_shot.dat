2500|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a [...]38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as {{projectiles}} such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting reticule appears on-screen. The longer the player is locked on, the smaller the reticule gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a <b>knee</b> <b>shot,</b> also stunning the target.|$|E

So the term [...] "insert" [...] is often confined to views of objects—and body parts, other than the head. Often inserts of this sort are done separately from the main action, by a second-unit director using stand-ins.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} episode, [...] "Premiere", the Cohen family home was shot on {{location}} in Malibu.

The pilot was shot on 35mm film stock, while subsequent episodes used digitally post-processed 16 mm in order to reduce the cost of production.|$|R

500|$|Most of [...] "Night Out" [...] {{was shot}} during the night. The scene that has Toby putting {{his hand on}} Pam's <b>knee</b> was <b>shot</b> at 2:30am on a Friday. The scene was shot about eight times because {{according}} to Kaling, [...] "everyone kept breaking because Toby was so vulnerable and awkward." [...] Kate Flannery did her stunts in the scene where Pam throws a football and hits Customer and Supplier Relations worker Meredith Palmer (Flannery) in the face. Flannery had a stunt double on the set, but she was never needed for the scene. Kate recalls that she [...] "didn't get a scratch in all 14 takes that we shot." [...] Lieberstein {{on the other hand}} used a stunt double for the scene in which Toby climbs over the fence. Although Lieberstein offered to do the stunt himself, executive producer and show runner Greg Daniels decided against it.|$|R

500|$|There {{was a scene}} {{cut from}} [...] "33" [...] where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken {{on the roof of}} the capitol {{building}} on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his <b>knees</b> (possibly <b>shot</b> or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.|$|R
50|$|The {{snap shot}} is {{accomplished}} {{with a quick}} snap of the wrists while the puck rests in place. The difference between a snap shot and a wrist shot is that the stick blade is accelerated towards the puck from a small distance behind it. This allows the player to flex the shaft {{on the ice and}} strike the puck at speed - although not to the degree of a full slap shot. The stick is usually not lifted higher than the <b>knee</b> during the <b>shot,</b> which makes this shot legal in most old-timer hockey leagues despite its rapid pace. Snap shots are the most common shot taken when the crease player receives the pass and decides not to one-time the puck.|$|R

25|$|Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a {{specific}} rule of hockey – which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop to their <b>knees</b> to block <b>shots</b> – to compliment his superb accuracy. Coming off {{the right wing}} or down the centre, he would unleash a “wicked knee-high shot” which would catch the opposing goalie between the glove – or stick – and pad. This shot placement was deliberately done in order to slow down a goalie’s reaction time; they were often unable to decide between using their glove hand or blocker hand to deflect or catch the puck, and shuffling to {{one side or the}} other to use their pads. Lalonde’s snapper was so lethal that opposing coaches would often assign three to four of their own players just to shadow him, and – in one of the earliest iterations of the trap – attempt to pin him into a corner in order to prevent his being able to get into a scoring position.|$|R
50|$|As night drew near, in Ambiatibe, {{a village}} 50 {{kilometers}} north of Antananarivo, after some deliberation, {{a decision was}} made to kill Berthieu. The chief gathered a platoon of six men armed with guns. At the sight, Jacques Berthieu knelt down. Two men fired simultaneously at him, but missed. Berthieu made {{the sign of the cross}} and bowed his head. One of the chiefs approached him and said: “Give up your hateful religion, do not mislead the people anymore, and we will make you our counselor and our chief, and we will spare you.” He replied: “I cannot consent to this; I prefer to die.” Two men fired again. Berthieu bowed his head in prayer once more, and they missed him. Another fired a fifth shot, which hit Berthieu without killing him. He remained on his <b>knees.</b> A last <b>shot,</b> fired at close range, finally killed Jacques Berthieu. His body was dumped into the Mananara River and was never recovered.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{prospective}} observational study that evaluated the frequency of prosthetic infections after total knee arthroplasty. During a six-year observational period, 171 patients underwent <b>knee</b> arthroplasty. Single <b>shot</b> prophylaxis with teicoplanin was administered to all patients. Nine patients (5.3 %) had a followup of less than four weeks; the remaining 162 had a follow-up of at least 12 weeks. Of these, 155 completed the 24 -month observational period. In the end, three patients developed early prosthetic joint infection which produced infection rates of 1.85 % and 1.93 % when the follow-up was ≥ 12 weeks and ≥ 24 months, respectively. The mean time from surgery to infection was 54 days (range, 14 – 87). All three infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to methicillin. Fever, pain, effusion and secretion were present in all cases. In this cohort of patients, no cases of delayed infection were observed. Thorough reporting {{is the first step}} in reducing the incidence of post-surgical infective complications and can contribute to more productive prophylactic protocols.|$|R
50|$|A flying knee (known as hanuman thayarn in Muay Thai, and {{sometimes}} called a jumping knee) is a knee strike {{very similar to}} a front knee, except that it is performed in stand-up fighting by jumping, and often by rushing towards the opponent. A more reckless application of the flying knee strike can be applied by rotating the body so that {{the side of the}} knee strikes the opponent, used more as an offensive pushing attack rather than a concussive KO attack. Generally, flying knee strikes can be effectively applied when the opponent is off-balanced, recovering from previous strikes, or as a counter to a strike by the opponent. It can also be used as a follow-up maneuver after delivering a particularly incapacitating strike. One example took place at a UFC event, where Pablo Garza knocked Fredson Paixao unconscious with a flying <b>knee</b> when Paixao <b>shot</b> in for a takedown. A famous flying knee strike in pop culture is the Knee of Justice used by Captain Falcon in the Super Smash Bros. series.|$|R

50|$|Much of Lalonde’s {{production}} {{came from}} his highly accurate snap shot, and his remarkable longevity which allowed him to play a physically aggressive style for upwards of 23 seasons. Lester Patrick, co-founder of the PCHA and then-captain of the Victoria Aristocrats, claimed in 1912 that Lalonde possessed the best shot in hockey: “He shoots every bit as hard as Pitre, and is much more deadly". Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a specific rule of hockey - which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop to their <b>knees</b> to block <b>shots</b> - to compliment his superb accuracy.

50|$|On August 28, 1994, Sandifer {{was ordered}} {{to carry out a}} hit for his gang. He opened fire several times with a 9 {{millimeter}} semiautomatic pistol, striking several youths. Sandifer quickly fled the scene. Among the victims was Shavon Dean, age 14, who later died from her gunshot wounds. The crime spree made national headlines. The nation was shocked by the brutality of the crime {{and the fact that the}} alleged perpetrator was 11 years old. The Chicago Police began a childhunt for Sandifer. According to Sgt. Ronald Palmer, of the Chicago Police, Sandifer's actions were a gang initiation gone wrong. On August 31, while still in hiding, Sandifer was met by brothers Cragg and Derrick Hardaway, ages 16 and 14, members of the Black Disciples street gang. Sandifer was told he was being taken some place safe and ordered into a waiting car. Instead, he was taken to a viaduct underpass and told to get on his knees. While on his <b>knees,</b> he was <b>shot</b> twice in the back of the head by the Hardaway brothers. Sandifer's body was discovered by the Chicago Police Department in the early morning of September 1. Both Hardaways were later convicted of Sandifer's murder.Sandifer's funeral was held at the Youth Center Church of God in Christ on Chicago's Northwest Side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{collected}} all {{my friends}} about New Orleans at one of our friends' houses in that place, and we sat in council three days before we got all our plans to our notion; we then determined to undertake the rebellion at every hazard, and make as many friends as we could for that purpose. Every man's business being assigned him, I started to Natchez on foot, having sold my horse in New Orleans,--with the intention of stealing another after I started. I walked four days, and no opportunity offered {{for me to get}} a horse. The fifth day, about twelve, I had become tired, and stopped at a creek to get some water and rest a little. While I was sitting on a log, looking down the road the way that I had come, a man came in sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him, I was determined to have his horse, if he was in the garb of a traveler. He rode up, and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler. I arose and drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount. He did so, and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek, and ordered him to walk before me. He went a few hundred yards and stopped. I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to his shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said, 'If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I die,' I told him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and dropped on his <b>knees,</b> and I <b>shot</b> him through the back of the head. I ripped open his belly and took out his entrails, and sunk him in the creek. I then searched his pockets, and found four hundred dollars and thirty-seven cents, and a number of papers that I did not take time to examine. I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat, in the creek. His boots were brand-new, and fitted me genteelly; and I put them on and sunk my old shoes in the creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his clothes and put them into his portmanteau, as they were brand-new cloth of the best quality. I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled, and directed my course for Natchez in much better style than I had been for the last five days.|$|R
5000|$|In 1895 Kaminski and a {{faction of}} his adherents {{occupied}} the Polish parish church of St. Paul, a Roman Catholic {{church of the}} Diocese of Omaha in South Omaha, Nebraska, where he conducted devotion [...] "in his own way". It is unclear how this occupation of the church happened, or for how long it lasted, but {{on the morning of}} , while Kaminski celebrated Mass in the church, 40 Polish men gathered at the church and eight of them then entered and called on Kaminski to give them the keys to the church. He refused and, standing before the altar and holding revolvers in both hands with six more revolvers and two carbines on the altar, without saying anything he started shooting. He shot Joseph Dargaszewski through his right <b>knee</b> and then <b>shot</b> at the altar to create the impression that he had also been shot at. Later that month, on , calling him [...] "a Polish nationalist who posed as a priest", Elia W. Peattie wrote, in the Omaha World-Herald: [...] "Kaminski barricaded himself in the sanctuary and used firearms to retain control, wounding Xavier Dargaczewski and Frank Kraycki." [...] Peattie quoted in her article: [...] "The priest, he say: 'I never leave this town till I see the bare bones of this church!' And he is seein' 'em!" [...] It was rumored he started the fire that burned the church, {{at the end of that}} month, to a pile of rubble and ashes; Kaminski's faction damaged fire hydrants so there was no way to extinguish the fire. Kaminski was arrested. From Omaha he went to Freeland, Pennsylvania, where he stayed only a few months because he could not obtain any adherents among the local independent division; from Freeland he went to New Britain, Connecticut. According to Kruszka, the 1895 organization of a Roman Catholic parish in New Britain caused a four-month dispute over the location of its church. The parishioners were scattered throughout the town and wanted to have the church nearby. Two factions formed, at opposite ends of the city. The Roman Catholic priest could not reconcile their differences. One faction purchased property for the new Roman Catholic church; the other faction also purchased property and obtained Kaminski for their church. After a replacement Roman Catholic priest was assigned to the Roman Catholic parish, the dispute was settled and Kaminski was dismissed by the disbanded faction. Finally, from New Britain he went to Buffalo, New York, in 1896.|$|R
50|$|During {{a period}} of 80 seconds, Constable Chipperfield fired nine shots in total, with eight hitting Boyd. He was the only officer to fire his weapon. Two of the first eight shots created serious wounds, one causing {{sufficient}} bleeding to soak Boyd's jeans in blood from the waist to the <b>knees.</b> The final <b>shot</b> was fired when Boyd was crawling on the street unarmed, as many police and civilian witnesses testified in interviews with the VPD homicide team and at the Coroner's Inquest. This was confirmed {{by some of the}} police officers and civilian witnesses but others, including Cst Chipperfield, testified that Boyd was attempting to get to his feet when the final shot was fired. The video evidence described below is not conclusive concerning this point since during the final second before the last shot is fired, Boyd's body is obscured by an automobile between the camera and him. At the Coroner's Inquest one of the officers involved testified that after 4 or 5 shots had been fired Boyd dropped the chain that he had been swinging and it was retrieved by this officer. This was verified by the video evidence described below which was not available {{at the time of the}} Inquest. Constable Chipperfield testified at the Coroner's Inquest that he was not aware that Boyd had been disarmed and that he would not have shot the final shot had he known this. The forensic evidence showed that this final shot struck Boyd first in the cheek and then the chest passing through his heart and leading to his death. The forensic pathologist testified at the Coroner's Inquest into Boyd's death that this shot could not have been fired when Boyd was standing erect although he conceded that it could have been fired when Boyd was attempting to get to his feet with his torso parallel to the ground. Given that Constable Chipperfield was at least 6 inches shorter than Boyd, simple geometry shows that the bullet trajectory determined by forensic analysis is inconsistent with Boyd being erect or nearly erect at the time of the final shot. Constable Chipperfield in fact gave two different conflicting accounts of the final shot, one in his Duty Report when he stated that the final shot was one fired to Boyd's head, after he had decided that Boyd must be wearing body armour. (Boyd in fact was wearing a sleeveless T-shirt). In his testimony to the Coroner's Inquest, Constable Chipperfield gave a different description of the final shot, claiming that the second last shot was one fired to his face and that he understood has gone through his face, and the last shot being one fired to his heart. It is not clear why he would have fired a final shot to Boyd's centre of mass if he indeed believed that Boyd was wearing body armour.|$|R
