40|$|Cymothoid isopods (family Cymothoidae) are {{commonly}} found parasitizing diverse fishes, including commercial species. However, {{the effects of}} these parasites on host body condition are still poorly known. Here we investigated the spatial variation of the effects of parasite infection on host body condition, using the parasitic load of the cymothoid Mothocya parvostis on the <b>Japanese</b> <b>halfbeak</b> Hyporhamphus sajori at 4 sampling sites in western Japan. M. parvostis prevalence at each site (41. 6 - 74. 4 %) was higher than that known for other fish host-cymothoid systems (usually less than 30 %). The number of isopods in infected hosts, the reproductive status of female isopods (i. e. ovigerous/non-ovigerous), and the body size of female and male isopods relative to the size of their hosts were not significantly different among sites. However, at the site where human activity was most intense, M. parvostis infection had a significantly negative effect on host body condition. These results suggest that the effect of cymothoid infection on host body condition might be benign under natural conditions but becomes detrimental in habitats that are unsuitable for the host, such as highly human-impacted areas...|$|E
