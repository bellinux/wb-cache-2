50|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (ET0), sometimes incorrectly {{referred to}} as potential ET, is {{a representation of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>demand</b> for evapotranspiration and represents the evapotranspiration rate of a short green crop (grass), completely shading the ground, of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile. It {{is a reflection of the}} energy available to evaporate water, and of the wind available to transport the water vapour from the ground up into the lower atmosphere. Actual evapotranspiration is said to equal reference evapotranspiration when there is ample water. Some US states utilize a full cover alfalfa reference crop that is 0.5 m in height, rather than the short green grass reference, due to the higher value of ET from the alfalfa reference.|$|E

They are supposed to emerge from the interplay between <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> and metacognitive beliefs, but this assumption remains untested. Our research addressed this issue and tested the hypothesis that subjective stress states syndromes may be explained by <b>environmental</b> <b>demands,</b> metacognitive beliefs and their interplay. We recruited 210 participants who completed a working memory, vigilance or magazine-reading task. Our main results revealed that each syndrome of stress is explained by a specific set of predictors: Distress is explained by the dynamic between metacognition and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands,</b> Worry was only predicted by metacognition and Task engagement is explained by both <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> and metacognition. Our results were discussed in reference to the S-REF model (Wells & Matthews, 1994) and they brought some insight in when environmental and metacognitive factors predict stress state components in performance settings...|$|R

Problem statement: Today, {{the society}} stands before a permanent accelerated environmental threat. Companies become increasingly over the environmental problems and more companies look over their activity {{and how it}} influences the environment. Historical the environmental issue has been forgotten and it is first during the end of 1990 the environmental issue intensive has been noticed. Earlier the environmental work’s high costs was the cause, but now the companies realized the weight {{and the importance of}} imposing focus on environment commitments and sees it, as an investment. In order to few one surely functioned premises that meets the environmental requirements, is it important that both tenant and real-estate owners know each others needs. On the basis of the prevailing situation environmental equirement, it is interesting to study how tenant and real-estate owners collaborates with each other in order to find sustainable and operational development, and how important environment standards on premises is, for tenants respective real-estate owners? Approach: The essay aims to describe from an economic perspective, how a selection big company, organizes environmental adaptations of premises, and to explain and analyze, possible differences average real-estate owners and tenant. Method: The authors have chosen a describing design of the essay, and primary - and secondary information constitute the bas. The consistently have a qualitative run-up been chosen and the reality has been studied through applying interviews. During the process's time it has been checked that the essay holds a high validity. Conclusions: Environmental work has become increasingly integrated, and today the company’s sees environment investments, as competitive advantage on the market. The majority of big Swedish companies own their buildings, and they see it as a good capital investment, and mean lower costs for the company. Facility management has today been increased with the aid of added values, so as good service and customer care. The real-estate owners take an active interest in the tenant’s activity and works with getups replies, adapted to <b>environmental</b> <b>demand</b> solutions. The most common request to <b>environmental</b> <b>demand</b> solution is refuse collection and energy efficiency improvement. The tenants consider that noises are the factor that is most important to deal with. The tenants' requirements are in front that premises will be tailored after the company activity. The real-estate owners believe that it ahead, will become a bigger request on <b>environmental</b> <b>demand</b> solutions and the companies are preparing for future needs. Today, there is also a bigger willing to pay for environmental solutions of premises...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{existing}} theoretical contexts {{of the job}} and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> of the nursing profession in the National Health Service (NHS) and to investigate how these job and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> impact on the personal constructs of older nurses within the NHS. Background: Nursing {{is the single most}} widely practiced profession in the healthcare sector in the United Kingdom. However, nurses contend with challenging job and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> on a daily basis, which deplete them of personal constructs (or resources) required to stay in the profession. Methods: A multilevel exploratory qualitative research design was employed. Ten managers were interviewed for the preliminary study, based on which the three characteristics of an age-friendly NHS workplace were established: health, retirement, and flexibility. Then an in-depth literature review revealed that the most adversely affected job within the NHS was the nursing profession. Finally, a focus group study was undertaken with six older nurses working in the NHS. Results: The most compelling finding {{of this study is that}} older nurses would generally not want to stay on the job if they had to work in the ward area. The physical, cognitive, and sensory constructs of older nurses are negatively affected by the job and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> of the ward areas. Conclusions: Understanding how these job and <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> of the workplace affect an older nurse’s personal constructs may help support a better design of nurse work and the wards and help extend the working lives of older nurses in the NHS...|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome is {{a cluster of}} more or less related metabolic and cardiovascular derangements including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, blood and tissue dislipidemia, {{high blood pressure and}} it is often associated with neuroendocrine and immunological dysregulations. The aetiology of this syndrome is clinically highly relevant because it predisposes to life-threatening complications, such as Diabetes Mellitus, kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. Contributing factors include a sedentary life-style combined with increased dietary fat intake and psychosocial stress. From a biological viewpoint, however, the {{metabolic syndrome}} can be considered as a maladaptive consequence of an initially successful adaptation to high <b>environmental</b> <b>demands.</b> As opposed to pre-historic times - when <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> were usually energy-costly (e. g., fight/flight/hunt) and nutritional resource often inadequate - energy-utilizing actions serve no longer an optimal solution to deal with <b>environmental</b> <b>demands</b> of current human society. This paper describes the interactions between psychosocial stress and nutrition and how these may affect emotional and metabolic components of the metabolic syndrome. A deeper understanding of these interactions is necessary to come to effective treatment and prevention of the metabolic syndrome in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus are functionally associated with the induction of the waking state but discharge during the phase of the slow oscillations that support neuronal activity.
