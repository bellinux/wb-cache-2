50|$|Where the {{operating}} conditions {{do not require}} otherwise, the pulse group operation is recommended. Here, whole mains voltage shafts are switched to the load or blocked. For example, a controller requires 60% output (via a 4-20 mA signal, which corresponds to 0-100%). The thyristor power controller switches 60% of the solid waves to the load while blocking 40%. The operating mode is {{to be regarded as}} unproblematic. Only {{in the case of a}} too weakly designed network, it is possible for illuminating installations which are connected to the same network to have undesired luminance fluctuations (flicker effect).Some operating conditions require switching in each half-wave and thus very fast operation. Examples are control sections with very fast behavior or a required current limitation with low element resistance in the cold state. In this operating mode, the controller changes the phase angle α of the thyristor ignition timing. A half wave corresponds to 180 ° el. (electrical degree). The actuator can adjust the phase angle of 0 ° el. (maximum power) up to 180 ° el. (no power). In a 50 Hz mains the controller switches every 20 ms and shows very fast behavior. As a result of the voltage flanks during switch-on, disadvantages such as EMC <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> or control voltage output also result in ohmic loads. This situation must be counteracted by means of line filters or the corresponding plant size with compensating systems.|$|E

Therefore, {{the potential for}} interference only existed when Galaxy 15 drifted into the line of sight of a ground uplink segment intended for another communications satellite operating on the same uplink frequency range {{in the path of}} Galaxy 15. The magnitude of the interference risk depended on a large number of variables, including the size of the uplink antenna used (the larger the antenna, the lower the risk to hit Galaxy 15), the location of the uplink and whether inside the Galaxy 15 footprint, and the onboard gain capabilities of the satellite proximate to Galaxy 15. Satellite operators devised a variety of strategies to mitigate the potential interference to their birds' downlink transmissions including, temporarily transferring uplinks to larger uplink antenna, deliberately off-pointing uplink antennas to put Galaxy 15 into the null, maneuvering the satellite being passed to maintain a minimum angular separation, increasing the satellite's gain sensitivity settings allowing a lowering of the uplink power needed and latterly moving the uplink to a location where Galaxy 15 had no uplink coverage (i.e. Hawaii). These techniques were successfully able to reduce, mitigate and minimize for commercial satellite operations most <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> during a Galaxy 15 fly by. Smaller sized stationary receive only sites, like those used by amateurs or SMATV which have a wider beam width reception potential, may have experienced interference, while for the most part commercial operators experienced no adverse effects from Galaxy 15 during its failure period thanks to the execution of the mitigation practices devised {{in the wake of the}} crisis.|$|E

A. caesiiglauca has a distinct preference for grassland/scrub habitats. Its absence from drier sites is attributable to its inability to tolerate desiccation. A. fissistipula is restricted to streamside habitats because it is unable to tolerate desiccation. Its low <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> excludes it from grassland/scrub habitats.

30|$|Let us assume {{there are}} five {{available}} frequencies represented by numbers, which are opportunistically available to the CR operation. Since the PU and the CR networks share the same radio frequency band, the frequencies temporarily used by PUs cannot be utilized by the CR users {{if they are in}} the interference range, and therefore, those channels are blocked for corresponding CR link indicated by the corresponding blocked channels list. For the CR link, B channels { 1, 2 } cannot be used due to the possible interference with the service area of the PU base station a, for the CR link C channels { 3, 4 } are blocked, for the CR link F channels { 1, 2, 4, 5 } are blocked, etc. The conflict edges represent the potential interference between the CR links with two edge weights per edge indicating co-channel and adjacent channel <b>interference</b> <b>potential.</b> In Fig. 2, the edge between the CR link A and CR link B has weights of 1 for co-channel and 0.1 for the adjacent channel, indicating very high <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> between those links, and therefore, those links cannot use the same channel. The edge between the CR link C and CR link D has a conflict weight of 0.6 / 0.05 indicating a medium <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> and the edge between CR link B and CR link F has a weight of 0.2 / 0 indicating a low co-channel interference and no adjacent channel interference. This indicates the possibility for sharing the channel. The existence of the conflict graph edges and the corresponding weights depends on the propagation channel characteristics and the antenna discrimination between the CR link pairs analyzed. For example, between the CR link A and CR link E, there is no edge because the terrain obstacle prevents possible interference path and corresponding links can use the same channel without danger of the mutual harmful interference. Practical implementation of constructing conflict graph and determining its weights is elaborated in Section 7.2.|$|E

40|$|Many animals produce {{sounds that}} overlap {{the sounds of}} others. In some animals, {{overlapping}} {{is thought to be}} an aggressive signal important in resource defence. Yet, overlapping can also occur by chance, and therefore its function is controversial. In this study, we conducted two experiments to test the function of overlapping in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. In experiment 1, we simulated territorial intrusions by broadcasting songs inside established chickadee territories. Resident males overlapped the playback-simulated intruders significantly less than expected by chance, as in most species in which overlapping has been described. Chickadees also overlapped more when they were farther from the intruder. This pattern suggests that chickadees avoid overlapping as a mechanism for reducing acoustic interference (2 ̆ 7 interference avoidance hypothesis 2 ̆ 7). However, the pattern could also constitute submissive signalling if chickadees signal de-escalation (associated with greater distance between opponents) through increasing rates of overlapping (2 ̆ 7 submissive signalling hypothesis 2 ̆ 7). Therefore, in experiment 2, we contrasted these two hypotheses by comparing responses to playback stimuli with low or high <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> and low or high signal value. We manipulated <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> by broadcasting stimuli at different amplitudes. We manipulated signal value by broadcasting either song stimuli, which elicit aggression, or white noise stimuli with matching time-amplitude characteristics. If overlapping is a submissive signal, then we predicted that chickadees would avoid overlapping song stimuli, but not white noise stimuli, which lack signal value. Contrary to this prediction, chickadees overlapped song and white noise stimuli equally often, but significantly less often than expected by chance. Furthermore, chickadees overlapped both types of stimuli more often when they were broadcast at lower amplitudes (i. e. lower <b>interference</b> <b>potential).</b> Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that overlapping is not a signal in this species, and that chickadees avoid overlapping both biotic and abiotic sounds as a mechanism for reducing interference. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we have {{formulated}} {{and addressed}} the FA {{problem in the}} CR networks. The FA ensures that the appropriate frequency is selected {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the SUs, while enabling an efficient usage of the radio frequency spectrum. The FA is a crucial function that limits the interference between the CR devices and PUs operating in a heterogeneous and dynamic radio environment. We have treated the FA problem as a graph coloring problem, while introducing the CR specificity. We have introduced the interference susceptibility with a two-layered conflict graph determining the <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> using co- and adjacent channel edge weights. The protection of the PUs is realized with a local dynamically changing list of blocked channels in the PUs interference range. We have proposed the interference characterization with four categories as an extension to a continuous interference model. As a generalization of our model, we proposed frequency and bandwidth selection instead of channel selection in the FA decision process. We have presented centralized and distributed sequential algorithms that can assign channels to the SU communication links in the CR network with the objective of minimizing network interference (CminSumInt, DminInt) and maximizing network throughput (CMaxSumCap, DMaxCap). The algorithms use dynamic vertex ordering with CR specific novel saturation metrics, which takes into account the frequency limitations due to the PUs activities and <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> of the already assigned neighboring SUs determining the degree of freedom in selecting the frequency. We showed the effectiveness of our algorithms in the reducing interference and improving the SU network throughput using the network simulation and performance evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Passenger {{boarding}} {{is always}} {{part of the}} critical path of the aircraft turnaround: both efficient boarding and online prediction of the boarding progress are essential for a reliable turnaround progress. However, the boarding progress is mainly controlled by the passenger behavior. A fundamental scientific approach for aircraft boarding enables the consideration of individual passenger behaviors and operational constraints {{in order to develop}} a sustainable concept for enabling a prediction of the boarding progress. A reliable microscopic simulation approach is used to model the passenger behavior, where the individual movement is defined as a one-dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete transition process. The simulation covers a broad range of behaviors and boarding strategies as well as the integration of new technologies and procedures. Future cabin management systems will provide an enabling infrastructure to further improve the overall turnaround process and to allow for on-line prediction of specific handling processes. The paper provides a method to indicate the progress of the aircraft boarding. In this context, the aircraft seats are used as a sensor network with the capability to detect the status (free or occupied) of each seat. These individual seat statuses are used to derive an aggregated <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> of the current seating condition with regards to the passenger seating process. The <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> is a major indicator for the expected aircraft boarding time.

40|$|The {{increase}} in mobile broadband data services has created significant demand for spectrum. Based {{on a low}} supply spectrum market, there is major interest in sharing spectrum between incumbent users and mobile broadband services. Radars are a large user of spectrum worldwide, therefore are a potential sharing partner. Mobile broadband service operators are trending toward small cell architectures. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} develop appropriate spectrum sharing policy that supports both incumbent radar protection and spectrum utilization by small cell systems. One vital aspect of developing appropriate sharing policy is accurately modeling the <b>interference</b> <b>potential</b> between services. The thesis examines if it is suitable to apply traditional propagation models and interference modeling methods for spectrum policy-making activities regarding small cell network architectures. The advances in technology that support spectrum sharing should not be bottlenecked by legacy interference modeling techniques when more granular methods are currently available. A specific scenario was selected for detailed analysis which is ship-borne naval radars interacting with small cell systems in the 3550 - 3650 MHz band. NTIA recommended ship-borne radar exclusion zones were analyzed using modern propagation modeling methods and compared to traditional modeling work completed by the NTIA. Modeling of aggregate interference impacts from small cell systems to ship-borne radars was completed. The new methods showed that ship-borne radar exclusion zones can be significantly reduced in ship-borne radar operation areas. In addition, it was found that there was insufficient information provided by the NTIA in regards to radar equipment specifications to accurately model <b>interference</b> <b>potential.</b> We conclude that the ITM propagation model was insufficient for accurate modeling of small cell systems. Correspondingly, to accurately model small cell systems in a site-specific manner, the use of higher resolution geographic data and a propagation model that can utilize this data is necessary.
