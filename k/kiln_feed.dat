50|$|Chlorides are minor {{additional}} constituents {{contained in}} the raw materials and fuels of the clinker burning process. They are released when the fuels are burnt or the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> is heated, and primarily react with the alkalis from the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> to form alkali chlorides. These compounds, which are initially vaporous, condense on the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> or the kiln dust, at temperatures between 700 °C and 900 °C, subsequently re-enter the rotary kiln system and evaporate again. This cycle in the area between the rotary kiln and the preheater can result in coating formation. A bypass at the kiln inlet allows effective reduction of alkali chloride cycles and to diminish coating build-up problems. During the clinker burning process, gaseous inorganic chlorine compounds are either not emitted at all or in very small quantities only.|$|E
50|$|A second {{application}} in cement {{for the bulk}} material analyzer is raw mix proportioning. An analyzer placed just upstream of the raw mill can monitor the chemistry of the raw mix and automatically trigger an adjustment in the proportions of the reclaimed stockpile and the correctives.

In this way, the volatile elements accumulated in the kiln-preheater system are precipitated again in the cyclone preheater, remaining almost completely in the clinker.|$|E

It was curious to see the kilns under the action of the fire, {{gradually}} changing color, like boiling lobsters. When, at last, the fires would be extinguished, the bricks being duly baked, Israel often took a peep into the low vaulted ways at the base, where the flaming fagots had crackled. The bricks immediately lining the vaults would be all burnt to useless scrolls, black as charcoal, and twisted into shapes the most grotesque; the next tier would be a little less withered, but hardly fit for service; and gradually, as you went higher and higher along the successive layers of the kiln, you came to the midmost ones, sound, square, and perfect bricks, bringing the highest prices; from these the contents of the kiln gradually deteriorated in the opposite direction, upward. But the topmost layers, though inferior to the best, by no means presented the distorted look of the furnace-bricks. The furnace-bricks were haggard, with the immediate blistering of the fire--the midmost ones were ruddy with a genial and tempered glow--the summit ones were pale with the languor of too exclusive an exemption from the burden of the blaze.|$|R

The amount of liquid, and hence {{the speed of the}} finishing reaction, is related to temperature. To meet the clinker quality objective, the most obvious control is that the clinker should reach a peak temperature such that the finishing reaction takes place to the required degree. A further reason to maintain constant liquid formation in the hot end of the kiln is that the sintering material forms a dam that prevents the cooler upstream feed from flooding out of the <b>kiln.</b> The <b>feed</b> in the calcining zone, because it is a powder evolving carbon dioxide, is extremely fluid.

The <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> material comprising zinc 'waste', fluxes and reductant (coke) is typically pelletized before addition to the kiln. The chemical process involves the reduction of zinc compounds to elemental zinc (boiling point 907 °C) which volatalises, which oxidises in the vapour phase to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is collected from the kiln outlet exhaust by filters/electrostatic precipitators/settling chambers etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{emissions}} of CO and organically bound carbon during the clinker burning process {{are caused by}} the small quantities of organic constituents input via the natural raw materials (remnants of organisms and plants incorporated in the rock {{in the course of}} geological history).

The system allows the evaluation of gas, tar and char yields for different pyrolysis temperature and residence time. The feeding screw conveyor and the kiln are rigidly connected; therefore a modification of the flow rate implies a modification of the inside solid motion and of residence time.

40|$|Abstract: Cement {{quality is}} {{typically}} assessed by its compressive strength development in mortar and concrete. The {{basis for this}} property is a well-burned clinker with consistent chemical composition and free lime. The main reason for the clinker free lime to change in situation with stable kiln operation is variation in the chemical composition of the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed.</b> This variation in chemical composition is related to raw mix control and the homogenization process. To ensure a constant quality of the product and maintain a stable and continuous operation of the kiln, the attention must be paid to storage and homogenization of raw materials and <b>kiln</b> <b>feed.</b> Due to variations in the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> chemical compositions that affect its burnability and the fuel consumption. The raw materials for Portland cement production are the mixture (as fine powder in the 'Dry process') of minerals containing calcium oxide, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, and magnesium oxide.

EAF slag was introduced in the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> at a lesser degree (20 %), but promoted a better raw mix burttability: furthermore, being a non-carbonated source of lime, it allows a reduction of both thermal requirement and emission of COZ, gas responsible for the greenhouse effect.

40|$|Cement {{manufacturing}} is {{a critically}} important {{industry in the}} United States and throughout the world. In 2006, U. S. cement plants produced 99. 8 million metric tons of cement. Worldwide production accounted for about 2. 5 billion metric tons. As with most large manufacturing industries, by-product materials are generated. These industrial by-product and waste materials must be managed responsibly to insure a clean and safe environment. Cement kiln dust (CKD) is a significant by-product material of the cement manufacturing process. Over {{the past several years}} dramatic advances have been achieved in the management and use of cement kiln dust, thus reducing its dependency on landfill disposal. Sustainability is the cornerstone of the cement industry, not only in the products that use cement, but also in its manufacturing process. From 1990 to 2006, the U. S. cement industry has reduced the amount of landfilled CKD 47 percent. This reduction in landfilled CKD comes despite the fact that domestic clinker production, as reported by the participants in the PCA CKD study, increased 95 percent during this same period. Overall clinker capacity in the U. S. has increased 28 percent since 1990.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{non-stoichiometry}} and isomorphic substitutions on {{the properties of}} some apatite-type compounds were investigated. These investigations were performed both {{in the fields of}} Portland cement chemistry and apatitic calcium phosphate-based biocements. Apatite compounds were synthesized by solid state methods and by hydrolysis of the reactant α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP). The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Apatite-type chlorellestadite is a compound found in cement kiln deposits. Its formation in the inlet part of the <b>kiln</b> obstructs the <b>feed</b> flow and was found to be an indication of the presence of high HCl(g) concentrations, principal cause of corrosion in the kiln lining. In order to quantify, by XRD analysis, the chlorellestadite phase in the coating samples, a good starting model of the crystal structure had to be chosen. For that purpose, many synthetic chlorellestadites were prepared varying the experimental conditions, and their crystal structure refined using the Rietveld method. At the same time, the range of thermal stability of nonstoichiometric chlorellestadite was determined providing {{a better understanding of the}} chemistry of silicate sulphate chloride-apatites. Biological hydroxyapatite is the main inorganic compound present in bones and teeth in all vertebrates. Synthetic hydroxyapatite with chemical composition and crystal structure similar to biological apatite represent therefore a suitable biocompatible material for orthopaedic applications. Calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) was prepared by mixing, at room and body temperature, an α-TCP powder with a 2. 5 wt% Na 2 HPO 4 accelerating solution. The resulting paste hardens forming CDHA as hydration product. Incorporation in the cement of Sr and Si, elements present as traces in bones, was achieved by hydrolysis of Sr-, Si-substituted α-TCP. The effect of substitutions on the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the cement pastes was monitored by isothermal calorimetry, XRD, SEM, and compressive strength testing.

40|$|Rotary kilns are {{important}} {{in a variety of}} different manufacturing areas for e. g. calcination and sintering of materials. In fact, two of the most produced materials in the world, cement and iron, are likely to start their journey in a rotary kiln. A rotary kiln is a large cylinder-formed furnace which rotates about its axis and where certain chemical and physical reactions take place by the influence of heat. The slope and the rotation make the material inside to move through the <b>kiln</b> from <b>feed</b> to discharge end. Due to high process temperatures the casing of the kiln is insulated by a refractory lining. Service conditions inside the kiln are rough and the lining is continuously degrading, especially pronounced in the hot zone of the kiln. If the lining is significantly deteriorated and can no longer protect the casing from the heat − the production is shut-down − leading to very high production losses. Despite many improvements of rotary kilns in the past decades there is still a gap in the knowledge regarding refractory linings during usage. Many assumptions are based on practical knowledge. One explanation to this could be the difficulty to study and observe the lining due to kiln size and high operating temperatures. Today, computer programs are of a great help for studying various issues without causing production delays or risking failures. However, the field of rotary kilns has stagnated on this matter and very little documentation can be found regarding numerical simulations of the lining, especially of the thermomechanical character. Purpose of this licentiate work is to study the mechanical behaviour of the lining by means of the finite element method (FEM). For this, a simplified model of a kiln was created and various fundamental cases were studied. The commercial FE-software LS-DYNA is used for the FE-calculations. The main work is based on cases of the kiln in cold condition. However, an initial study in warm condition is presented as well. The studied lining was a brick lining used in a kiln of dimensions typical for iron-ore pelletizing. Additionally, this licentiate thesis gives an overview {{of some of the most}} fundamental issues encountered in a refractory brick lining of a rotary kiln in general. Some material tests are presented as well. Model’s geometry was based on a section at the position of the support wheels, having a thickness of one brick. Some simplifications, such as choice of the material model and a rigid riding tyre, were done and a three-fold faster computational time was achieved. Response of the created model was partly verified analytically, by available in-house data and data from literature. It was confirmed that the model gives a good response. One of the important findings is that despite variation of conditions in cold state, e. g. rotational speed and relative ovality of the kiln, the induced stresses in the lining remained harmless. This challenges traditional believes which imply that ovality is of considerable importance for stress generation in the lining. On the other hand, by continuously tracing gaps between the bricks and the casing, it was found that integrity of the lining was significantly affected by rotational speed and ovality. Gaps as large as 80 mm could be observed between bricks and casing in a worst case scenario. An initial study on the kiln in hot state was made. Thermal expansion of a perfectly lined and an disordered brick lining were performed. The results indicate that stresses due to thermal expansion are rising slightly but are harmless in both cases. Additionally, expansion of the kiln stabilizes the lining and the effect of rotation compared to rotation in cold state is small. Analytical and numerical calculations were compared, indicating that analytical assumptions are often coarse and misleading from the reality.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{sustainability}} {{measures for}} quicklime and cement clinker production. It is {{the aim of}} this thesis to contribute to the effort of creating a more sustainable modus of industrial production. The methods used comprises process simulations through multicomponent chemical equilibrium calculations, fuel characterization and raw materials characterization through dynamic rate thermogravimetry. The investigated measures relate to alternative fuels, co-combustion, oxygen enrichment, oxyfuel combustion, mineral carbonation and optimizing raw material mixes based on thermal decomposition characteristics. The predictive multicomponent chemical equilibrium simulation tool developed has been used to investigate new process designs and combustion concepts. The results show that fuel selection and oxygen enrichment influence energy efficiency, and that oxyfuel combustion and mineral carbonation could allow for considerable emission reductions at low energy penalty, as compared to conventional post-combustion carbon dioxide capture technologies. Dynamic rate thermogravimetry, applied to <b>kiln</b> <b>feed</b> limestone, allows for improved feed analysis with a deeper understanding of how mixing of different feed materials will affect the production processes.

40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a rotary kiln with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the rotary kiln is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the rotary kiln, in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (rotary kiln – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the rotary kiln on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the rotary kiln, in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the rotary kiln. In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric acids, tar acids and high-heat-value waste materials in the rotary kiln. The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the rotary kiln, where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the rotary <b>kiln</b> and thus <b>feed</b> the coke bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the rotary kiln is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the rotary kiln are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the rotary kiln. One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the rotary kiln and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as tar acids can impair the energy balance in the rotary kiln and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising rotary kiln, post-combustion chamber and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|R

In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the <b>kiln</b> <b>feed).</b> The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Samples of {{gasification}} by-products {{produced at}} Polk Station and Eastman Chemical were obtained and characterized. Bulk samples {{were prepared for}} utilization studies by screening at the appropriate size fractions where char and vitreous frit distinctly partitioned. Vitreous frit was concentrated in the + 20 mesh fraction while char predominated in the - 20 + 100 mesh fraction. The vitreous frit component derived from each gasifier slag source was evaluated {{for use as a}} pozzolan and as aggregate. Pozzolan testing required grinding the frit to very fine sizes which required a minimum of 60 kwhr/ton. Grinding studies showed that the energy requirement for grinding the Polk slag were slightly higher than for the Eastman slag. Fine-ground slag from both gasifiers showed pozzoalnic activity in mortar cube testing and met the ASTM C 618 strength requirements after only 3 days. Pozzolanic activity was further examined using British Standard 196 - 5, and results suggest that the Polk slag was more reactive than the Eastman slag. Neither aggregate showed significant potential for undergoing alkali-silica reactions when used as concrete aggregate with ASTM test method 1260. Testing was conducted to evaluate the use of the frit product as a component of cement <b>kiln</b> <b>feed.</b> The clinker produced was comprised primarily of the desirable components Ca{sub 3 }SiO{sub 5 } and Ca{sub 2 }SiO{sub 4 } after raw ingredient proportions were adjusted {{to reduce the amount of}} free lime present in the clinker. A mobile processing plant was designed to produce 100 tons of carbon from the Eastman slag to conduct evaluations for use as recycle fuel. The processing plant was mounted on a trailer and hauled to the site for use. Two product stockpiles were generated; the frit stockpile contained 5 % LOI while the carbon stockpile contained 62 % LOI. The products were used to conduct recycle fuel tests. A processing plant was designed to separate the slag produced at Eastman into 3 usable products. The coarse frit has been shown to be suitable for use as clinker feed for producing Portland cement. The intermediate-size product is enriched in carbon (58 - 62 % C) and may be used as recycle fuel either in the gasifier or in a PC boiler. The fines product contains 30 - 40 % C and may also be used as a recycle gasifier fuel, as is presently done at TECO's Polk Station, however, due to gasifier operating requirements for the production of syngas, this is not feasible at Eastman...|$|E
