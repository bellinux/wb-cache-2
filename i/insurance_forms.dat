500|$|Danny Daniels choreographed {{the opening}} music number [...] "Anything Goes". Capshaw learned {{to sing in}} Mandarin and took tap dance lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw {{was not able to}} dance in it. Made by Barbara Matera out of {{original}} 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an elephant had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was costume designer Anthony Powell who had to fill in the <b>insurance</b> <b>forms.</b> As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put [...] "dress eaten by elephant".|$|E
50|$|Access to and {{usage of}} health care depends in part on immigrants’ level of acculturation. Linguistic {{difficulties}} can prevent immigrants from accessing health care in two major ways. First, English proficiency is necessary to complete health <b>insurance</b> <b>forms</b> and to effectively communicate medical problems with physicians; as such, difficulty in obtaining language assistance or translated private/public health <b>insurance</b> <b>forms</b> makes {{the process of getting}} coverage a more intimidating and discouraging ordeal. Second, language skills impact one’s available job opportunities. Without an adequate level of English proficiency, immigrants are constrained to certain jobs, often those that are less likely to provide job-based insurance.|$|E

50|$|I {{remember}} my mother. She was 52 {{years old when}} she died of ovarian cancer, and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life? She wasn't thinking about getting well. She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality. She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs. And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting condition. I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the <b>insurance</b> <b>forms.</b> So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health care system.

50|$|Medical assistants perform routine {{clinical}} and administrative duties under the direct supervision {{of a physician}} or other health care professional. Medical assistants perform many administrative duties, including answering telephones, greeting patients, updating and filing patients’ medical records, filling out <b>insurance</b> <b>forms,</b> handling correspondence, scheduling appointments, arranging for hospital admission and laboratory services, and handling billing and book keeping. Duties vary according to laws of the jurisdiction and may include taking medical histories and recording vital signs, explaining treatment procedures to patients, preparing patients for examination, and assisting during diagnostic examinations. Medical assistants collect and prepare laboratory specimens or perform basic laboratory tests on the premises, dispose of contaminated supplies, and sterilize medical instruments. They instruct patients about medications and special diets, prepare and administer medications as directed, authorize drug refills as directed, telephone prescriptions to a pharmacy, draw blood, prepare patients for X-rays, take electrocardiograms, remove sutures, and change dressings. They also facilitate communication between the patient {{and other health care}} professionals.|$|E
50|$|Original {{jurisdiction}} over workers' compensation claims has been diverted {{in much of}} the United States to administrative proceedings outside of the federal and state courts. They operate as no-fault schemes in which the employee need not prove the employer's fault; it is sufficient for the employee to prove that the injury occurred in the course of employment. If a third party other than the employer actually caused the injury, then the workers' compensation insurer (or self-insured employer) who is ordered to pay an employee's claim is usually entitled to initiate a subrogation action in the regular court system against the third party. In turn, workers' compensation insurance is regulated and underwritten separately from liability insurance. Just as the Insurance Services Office develops standard liability <b>insurance</b> <b>forms</b> and obtains approval for them from state insurance commissioners, the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) and various state rating bureaus provide similar services in the workers' compensation context.|$|E

A licensed practical nurse (LPN) {{in much of}} the United States and most Canadian provinces is a nurse who cares for people who are sick, injured, convalescent, or disabled. LPNs work under the direction of registered nurses or physicians. They also prepare and give injections and enemas, monitor and also perform placement of catheters, dress wounds, and give alcohol rubs and massages. To help keep patients comfortable, they assist with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene, moving in bed, standing, and walking. They might also feed patients who need help eating. Experienced LPNs may supervise nursing assistants and aides, and other LPNs.As part of their work, LPNs collect samples for testing, perform routine laboratory tests, and record food and fluid intake and output. They clean and monitor medical equipment. Sometimes, they help physicians and registered nurses perform tests and procedures. Some LPNs help to deliver, care for, and feed infants.LPNs also monitor their patients and report adverse reactions to medications or treatments. LPNs gather information from patients, including their health history and how they are currently feeling. They may use this information to complete <b>insurance</b> <b>forms,</b> pre-authorizations, and referrals, and they share information with registered nurses and doctors to help determine the best course of care for a patient. LPNs often teach family members how to care for a relative or teach patients about good health habits.|$|E
5000|$|The filmmakers {{were denied}} {{permission}} to film in North India and Amer Fort {{due to the}} government finding the script offensive. The government demanded many script changes, rewritings and final cut privilege. As a result, location work went to Kandy, Sri Lanka, with matte paintings and scale models applied for the village, temple, and Pankot Palace. Budgetary inflation also caused Temple of Doom to cost $28.17 million, $8 million more than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Filming began on April 18, 1983 in Kandy, and moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England on May 5. Producer Frank Marshall recalled, [...] "when filming the bug scenes, crew members would go home and find bugs in their hair, clothes and shoes." [...] Eight out of the nine sound stages at Elstree housed the filming of Temple of Doom. Lucas biographer Marcus Hearn observed, [...] "Douglas Slocombe's skillful lighting helped disguise the fact that about 80 percent of the film was shot with sound stages."Danny Daniels choreographed the opening music number [...] "Anything Goes".
