5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> Galileo stayed {{well away}} from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E

5|$|Valve Corporation is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher founded in 1996 by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. The company is currently based in Bellevue, Washington. Valve's first game was Half-Life, a first-person shooter released in 1998. It received universal acclaim and sold over 9 million units in retail. Alongside Half-Lifes launch, Valve released development tools {{to enable the}} player community to create content and mods.

5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests.

5|$|Most Spanish Americans saw {{no reason}} to {{recognize}} a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and Río de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade</b> and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{commissioned}} {{near the}} end of the Seven Years' War, Lowestoffe patrolled in British waters until 1773, when it underwent repairs. She was recommissioned in 1777 and served throughout the American War of Independence, including at the Battle of San Fernando de Omoa. After the bulk of the fighting ended, she returned home to Portsmouth in 1782, and did not see battle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> She spent most of her later years in British and Mediterranean waters, winning particular glory for her part in an engagement with two French frigates in 1795.

5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E

Stewart set about adopting a more professional approach, signing several players with Football League experience, including brothers John and George Burton and Billy Hardy, and led the team to promotion in his second season, winning the Second Division title. They remained in the First Division <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> finishing in the top four on two occasions, although the league was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I between 1915 and 1919.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hawaii, Oana played five {{sports in}} high school, {{and took up}} {{baseball}} professionally after he was noticed by Ty Cobb. He spent a few seasons {{in the minor leagues}} before joining the Phillies, who sent him back to the minors after six games in 1934. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> he played for various minor league teams, where his Hawaiian heritage proved to be both a selling point for teams and a hindrance to him making the majors, until the outbreak of World War II. Facing a shortage of active players, the Tigers signed him, and Oana played parts of 1943 and 1945 with the team. After 1945, he was sold to the Dallas Rebels, and he finished his professional career in 1951. He later operated a lakeside fishing business until his death in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade</b> and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, {{game show}} host, and comedian, {{best known for}} his {{character}} Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful special about it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade,</b> Reubens would be completely committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was less successful than its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Great Famine of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism, a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing famine, and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated. Food prices remained at similar levels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>decade.</b> Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.|$|E
