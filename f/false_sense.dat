Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play.

30|$|The {{compromised}} secondary {{users can}} report <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> {{information to the}} decision center. According {{to the way they}} send <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> reports, attackers can be classified into two categories: selfish users and malicious users. The selfish users report yes or high energy level when their sensed energy level is low. In this way they intentionally cause false alarm such that they can use the available spectrum and prevent others from using it. The malicious users report no or low signal level when their sensed energy is high. They will reduce the detection rate, which yields more interference to the primary user. When the primary user is not detected, the secondary users may transmit in the occupied spectrum and interfere with the transmission of the primary user. In this paper, we investigate two attack models, False Alarm (FA) Attack and False Alarm & Miss Detection (FAMD) Attack, as presented in [26, 27].|$|R
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus.

His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her a <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality {{he saw in the}} original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game.

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a <b>false</b> <b>sense</b> of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive {{radio is}} an {{enabling}} technology for efficient utilization of radio spectrum. A key function of cognitive radios is spectrum sensing, which enables secondary users to identify vacant spectrum not used by primary users (a. k. a. spectrum “white spaces”). Although spectrum sensing {{is one of}} the essential functionalities of cognitive radios, its security-related problems have not been studied. In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network that employs a distributed spectrum sensing framework. Under this framework, we associate a secondary user terminal reporting <b>false</b> spectrum <b>sensing</b> information with a terminal experiencing Byzantine failure. To enhance the robustness of distributed spectrum sensing against such terminals, we propose a scheme called weighted sequential probability ratio test (WSPRT). Analysis and simulation results show that WSPRT can guarantee the accuracy of sensing results even when a considerable number of secondary users are reporting <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> information.

Hence, it is less likely to affect the final decision. Moreover, a sensing report with low weight will be counted only if a final decision cannot be reached after combining all the other sensing reports with weight. As long as there are sufficient trusted users in a group, a robust decision can still be reached even if there are too many malicious users (seen in Figs. 5 and 6).|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{cooperative}} {{spectrum sensing}} based on crowdsourcing in cognitive radio networks. Since intelligent mobile users such as smartphones and tablets can sense the wireless spectrum, channel sensing tasks {{can be assigned}} to these mobile users. This {{is referred to as}} the crowdsourcing method. However, there may be some malicious mobile users that send <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> reports deliberately, for their own purposes. <b>False</b> <b>sensing</b> reports will influence decisions about channel state. Therefore, it is necessary to classify mobile users in order to distinguish malicious users. According to the sensing reports, mobile users should not just be divided into two classes (honest and malicious). There are two reasons for this: on the one hand, honest users in different positions may have different sensing outcomes, as shadowing, multi-path fading, and other issues may influence the sensing results; on the other hand, there may be more than one type of malicious users, acting differently in the network. Therefore, it is necessary to classify mobile users into more than two classes. Due to the lack of prior information of the number of user classes, this paper casts the problem of mobile user classification as a dynamic clustering problem that is NP-hard. The paper uses the interdistance-to-intradistance ratio of clusters as the fitness function, and aims to maximize the fitness function. To cast this optimization problem, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm for user classification in order to obtain bounded close-to-optimal solutions, and analyzes the approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm. Simulations show the distributed algorithm achieves higher performance than other algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Accurate {{spectrum}} sensing {{is important in}} cognitive radio networks. <b>False</b> <b>sensing</b> results in either waste of spectrum or harmful interference to primary users. To improve accuracy, cooperative {{spectrum sensing}}, in which a set of secondary users cooperatively sense {{the presence of the}} primary user, has emerged.

In this paper, we consider the attack model whereby the attacker injects selfconsistent false data simultaneously, and propose a modified COI (combinatorial optimization identification) algorithm to defend against such attacks. We also provide a theorem that detection uncertainty may exist in cooperative spectrum sensing. We intensively evaluate our algorithm with simulations, and the results show that our algorithm is a good technique to complement an existing algorithm, called IRIS.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{cognitive}} radio (CR) system, cooperative spec-trum sensing (CSS) {{is the key}} to improving sensing performance in deep fading channels. In CSS networks, signals received at the secondary users (SUs) are sent to a fusion center to make a final decision of the spectrum occupancy. In this process, the presence of malicious users sending <b>false</b> <b>sensing</b> samples can severely degrade the performance of the CSS network. In this paper, with the compressive sensing (CS) technique being implemented at each SU, we build a CSS network with double sparsity property. A new malicious user detection scheme is proposed by utilizing the adaptive outlier pursuit (AOP) based low-rank matrix completion in the CSS network. In the proposed scheme, the malicious users are removed in the process of signal recovery at the fusion center. The numerical analysis of the proposed scheme is carried out and compared with an existing malicious user detection algorithm...|$|R
