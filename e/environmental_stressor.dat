25|$|The exact {{cause of}} SIDS is unknown. The {{requirement}} {{of a combination}} of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility, a specific time in development, and an <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> has been proposed. These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accidental suffocation from bed sharing (also known as co-sleeping) or soft objects may also play a role. Another risk factor is being born before 39 weeks of gestation. SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs). Other causes include infections, genetic disorders, and heart problems. While child abuse in the form of intentional suffocation may be misdiagnosed as SIDS, this is believed to make up less than 5% of cases.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} study to examine the {{pathways}} from <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> to substance use among a sample of South African adolescents (NÂ =Â  2195). The study objective was to assess how <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> might affect cigarette smoking and alcohol use among South African adolescents, and to focus on one mechanism, low well-being, which might mediate this association. Participants consisted of 2195 Black, mixed ancestry ("Colored"), Indian, and White youth, aged 12 - 17 years old (mean ageÂ =Â  14. 6; SDÂ =Â  1. 8), recruited via a multi-stage stratified sampling procedure in Durban, Cape Town, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Data were collected via individual in-person structured interviews, administered by trained interviewers in the participant's preferred language. Structural equation modeling was {{used to analyze the}} interrelationships of <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> (violent victimisation, legal and illegal drug availability) and low well-being (depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, health problems) with respect to adolescent cigarette smoking and alcohol use. The results supported our hypotheses: <b>Environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> were related to low well-being which, in turn, was linked to both adolescent smoking and alcohol use. There were also direct pathways from <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> to both adolescent smoking and alcohol use. Smoking and alcohol use were significantly correlated. The findings suggest that <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> may be associated with diminished psychological and physical well-being, as well as smoking and alcohol use, among South African adolescents. Longitudinal research is warranted to further understand the interrelationship of <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors,</b> low well-being, and adolescent substance use, so that these issues may be addressed by South African programmes and policies.

Cold weather stressors simultaneously extend male longevity thereby raise human sex ratio in its older age bracket.

5000|$|This problem {{states that}} {{it is very hard to}} predict whether the {{presence}} of a stressor will lead to the development of a disorder. The reason behind this is that experiencing the <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> may lead to developing the disorder. However, diagnosing a patient on this alone would result in an absurd amount of false positives. [...] An example of this would be smoking and cancer. If doctors were to diagnose everyone who ever smoked a cigarette or a cigar with cancer it would quickly become apparent that it is an ineffective diagnostic criterion because many individuals would not develop lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Endogenous {{depression}} (melancholia) is an atypical sub-class of {{the mood}} disorder, {{major depressive disorder}} (clinical depression). Endogenous depression occurs due {{to the presence of}} an internal (cognitive, biological) stressor instead of an external (social, <b>environmental)</b> <b>stressor.</b> Endogenous depression includes patients with treatment-resistant, non-psychotic, major depressive disorder, characterized by abnormal behavior of the endogenous opioid system but not the monoaminergic system. Symptoms vary in severity, type, and frequency and can be attributed to cognitive, social, biological, or environmental factors that result in persistent feelings of sadness and distress. Since symptoms are due to a biological phenomenon, prevalence rates tend to be higher in older adults. Due to this fact, biological-focused treatment plans are often used in therapy to ensure the best prognosis.|$|E

50|$|Gene families, {{part of a}} {{hierarchy}} of information storage in a genome, play {{a large role in}} the evolution and diversity of multicellular organisms. Gene families are large units of information and genetic variability. Over evolutionary time, gene families have expanded and contracted with new gene families being formed and some gene families being lost. In several evolutionary lineages, genes are gained and lost at relatively same rates. Adaptive expansion of gene families occurs when natural selection would favour additional gene copies. This is the case when an <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> acts on a species. Gene amplification is more common in bacteria and is a reversible process. Adaptive contraction of gene families commonly results from accumulation of loss of function mutations. A nonsense mutation which prematurely halts gene transcription becomes fixed in the population, leading to the loss of genes. This process occurs when changes in the environment render a gene redundant.|$|E
50|$|The chronic {{phase is}} first seen {{six days after}} {{infection}} and persist for at least 12 months under experimental conditions. This phase is characterized histologically {{by the absence of}} acute lesions and the presence of LOS of successive morphologies. These LOSs are positive by ISH for TSV. A low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases. LOSs are not by themselves characteristic of TSV infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus (LOVV), lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV), lymphoid organ virus (LOV), rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp (RPS) and yellowhead virus (YHV). Diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic, as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection. Survivors may become carriers for life. Shrimp with chronic TSV infection are not as vigorous as uninfected shrimp, as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp. A 2011 study by Laxminath Tumburu looked at the relationship between an <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> (pesticide Endosulfan) and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and their interactions on the susceptibility and molting of marine penaeid shrimp L. vannamei and found the interference of endosulfan-associated stress led to increasingly higher susceptibility at postmolt stage during the acute phase of the TSV disease cycle.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{embrittlement}} {{of grain}} boundaries or other defects {{that can serve}} as crack initiators, the addition of radiation attack at cracks can cause intergranular stress corrosion cracking. The main <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> that forms due to radiation is hydrogen embrittlement at crack tips. Hydrogen ions are created when radiation splits water molecules, which is present because water is the coolant in PWR's, into OH− and H+. There are several suspected mechanisms that explain hydrogen embrittlement, three of which are the decohesion mechanism, the pressure theory, and the hydrogen attack method. In the decohesion mechanism, {{it is thought that}} the accumulation of hydrogen ions reduces the metal-to-metal bond strength, which makes it easier to cleave atoms apart. The pressure theory is the idea that hydrogen can precipitate as a gas at internal defects and create bubbles within the material. The stress caused by the expanding bubble in addition to the applied stress is what lowers the overall stress required to fracture the material. The hydrogen attack method is similar to the pressure theory, but in this case it is suspected that the hydrogen reacts with carbon in the steel to form methane, which then forms blisters and bubbles at the surface. In this case, the added stress by the bubbles is enhanced by the decarburization of the steel, which weakens the metal. In addition to hydrogen embrittlement, radiation induced creep can cause the grain boundaries to slide against each other. This destabilizes the grain boundaries even further, making it easier for a crack to propagate along its length.|$|E

40|$|This review scrutinises the {{different}} cellular mechanisms and <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> {{that lead to}} bleaching and discuss the numerous effects of these. Coral bleaching is characterized by corals losing their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Different <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors,</b> e. g. elevated sea temperatures, irradiance, changing salinity and increasing atmospheric CO 2 induce damage in multiple sites of the photosynthetic apparatus of the zooxanthellae, leading to bleaching. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in both coral and its symbiotic zooxanthellae, which can exacerbate the damage within both organisms. Formation of toxic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is also induced during bleaching and can enhance the formation of ROS further. Other cellular events leading to coral bleaching are programmed cell death (PCD) and necrosis. Furthermore the fact that zooxanthellae are found in eight different clades that are susceptible to different <b>environmental</b> <b>stressors</b> is expounded. The corals {{ability to cope with}} these stressors is dependent on the clade of zooxanthellae it is associated with and this may be important for future coral reef diversity...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of cold stress as a predisposing factor for necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Birds were either challenged or not as described above, and either exposed or not to repeated cold stress (15 degrees C for 12 h/day for 4 days). From each bird, intestinal gross lesions were scored and intestinal digesta pH and viscosity were measured. C. perfringens was counted in the caecum. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed that the cold stress in challenged birds significantly increased the incidence and the severity of necrotic enteritis lesions (? 0. 05), while causing no lesions in unchallenged birds. Moreover, the cold stress caused a significant increase (? 0. 05) in the pH and C. perfringens counts in the caeca. The study provides evidence that cold stress increased the susceptibility to necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental model and thus should be regarded as a physical <b>environmental</b> <b>stressor</b> that could significantly affect the welfare, health and intestinal ecosystem of broiler chicks...|$|E
