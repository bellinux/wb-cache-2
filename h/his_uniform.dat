5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} defencemen in NHL history, Niedermayer has earned numerous accolades throughout his career.

5|$|As a child, Harmon played {{baseball}} at Walter Johnson Memorial Field, {{named after the}} Hall of Fame pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho. He worked as a farmworker in his youth, where he lifted 10-gallon milk cans, each can weighing about 95lb (43kg).

5|$|On August 18, 2009, Rodríguez {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers for minor league {{reliever}} Matt Nevarez and two PTBNL.

He hit his first home run with the Rangers since 2002 on August 29, a solo shot against Minnesota Twins reliever José Mijares.|$|E

5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 Thomas Beecham and Robert Courtneidge {{presented}} {{a season of}} opera at the Shaftesbury Theatre. Harrison was recruited as a conductor along with Percy Pitt, Hamish MacCunn and Landon Ronald. After a second season with Courtneidge, Beecham set up on his own account in 1916, and established the Beecham Opera Company at the Aldwych Theatre of which his father Sir Joseph Beecham was the lessee. Harrison, Pitt, and Eugene Goossens joined him as assistant conductors. In 1916 Harrison joined the Royal Flying Corps and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the technical branch. He was based in London, and was frequently able to conduct for Beecham, often wearing <b>his</b> <b>uniform.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals Care facilities in Greater St. Louis. The team would also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white circle on their jerseys. The patch will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already wearing it as <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> number, 42, {{alongside}} {{those of}} Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32). From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was {{the vice president}} for personnel at Chock full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry. Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank's first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.|$|E
5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of <b>his</b> <b>uniform,</b> and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E

5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It opens {{at the start of}} the rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on <b>his</b> <b>uniform,</b> Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E
5|$|The grenade {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing, it could easily stick to <b>his</b> <b>uniform.</b> The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was officially}} in the RAF as a Greek (he became a Rhodesian citizen {{only after the}} war), Plagis {{considered}} himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on <b>his</b> <b>uniform</b> denoting him as such. He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay, and painted that name {{on the side of}} each cockpit. After briefly flying Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF, Plagis joined No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron, an almost all-Rhodesian Spitfire unit, on 19 July 1941. He served in the UK for about half a year, during which he was commissioned as a pilot officer, before being posted to the Mediterranean theatre in January 1942.|$|E
