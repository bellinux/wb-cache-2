50|$|Thomas Cremer was {{an early}} {{supporter}} {{of the idea that}} higher order chromatin arrangement and the architecture of the nucleus are essential for cardinal nuclear functions. Spatial organization of chromatin, now considered as the highest level of epigenetic gene regulation, {{has been the focus of}} his research since the early 70's. Together with his brother Christoph Cremer he pioneered laser-UV-microirradiation experiments that indirectly implied a territorial organization of chromosomes in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus.</b> This finding led Thomas Cremer to his concept of a new field of cytogenetic research, called by him as interphase cytogenetics. Realization of interphase cytogenetics was achieved during the 1980s where T. Cremer made major contributions to the development of in situ hybridization techniques to visualize normal and aberrant chromosomes and chromosomal subregions directly in the cell nucleus and provided direct evidence for chromosome territories (CTs). During the 1990s he realized together with P. Lichter the concept of comparative genomic hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and to a matrix with DNA spots representing specific genomic sites. During the late 1990s until now his laboratory has made major achievements in 3D multicolor FISH allowing the simultaneous visualization of all human chromosomes in human cells. In addition, he developed methods to visualize individual CTs and nuclear subcompartments to study their dynamics in living cells. T. Cremer has achieved major insight to compare nuclear phenotypes in a variety of species, ranging from primates, birds to the micro- and macronucleus of ciliates with the goal to classify universally valid, species and cell-type specific normal features of nuclear architecture and distinguish them from disease correlated features.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChromosomes {{exist in}} the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> as {{individual}} chromosome territories. It is unclear to what extent chromosome territories occupy particular positions with {{respect to each other}} and how structural rearrangements, such as translocations, affect chromosome organization within the cell nucleus. Here we analyze the relative interphase positioning of chromosomes in mouse lymphoma cells compared to normal splenocytes. We show that in a lymphoma cell line derived from an ATM−/− mouse, two translocated chromosomes are preferentially positioned in close proximity to each other. The relative position of the chromosomes involved in these translocations is conserved in normal splenocytes. Relative positioning of chromosomes in normal splenocytes is not due to their random distribution in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> and persists during mitosis. These observations demonstrate that the relative arrangement of chromosomes in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> can be conserved between normal and cancer cells and our data support the notion that physical proximity facilitates rearrangements between chromosomes...|$|E

To systematically 							investigate whether the proximally positioned chromosomes were always the same in all cells, we developed an approach 							consisting of sequential FISH and CISH combined with laser-microdissection of chromosomes from the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> and followed by subsequent chromosome identification by microsatellite allele genotyping.

40|$|Cells of a V 79 subline of the Chinese hamster were microirradiated at {{wavelength}} 365 nm in {{the presence}} of the psoralen derivative, trioxsalen. Microirradiation was accomplished by a pulsed argon laser microbeam either in anaphase or in interphase 3 hr after mitosis. Inhibition of clonal growth and formation of micronuclei at the first postirradiation mitosis were observed after microirradiation of anaphase chromosomes and of small parts of the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Microirradiation of the cytoplasm beside the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> or between the sets of chromosomes moving apart from each other in anaphase did not produce these effects. Anaphase experiments showed that only the daughter cell which received microirradiated chromatin exhibited an abnormal growth pattern. Most interestingly, shattering of the whole chromosome complement could be induced by microirradiation of small parts of the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> and post-treatment with caffeine. Since microirradiation of chromatin in the absence of psoralen was not effective, we consider formation of psoralen photoadducts to nucleic acids in microirradiated chromatin to be the specific cause of the effects. We suggest that DNA photolesions in chromosome segments present in the microirradiated part of the nucleus can induce shattering of all the chromosomes in the microirradiated nucleus. Several possibilities are discussed to explain this unexpected finding. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the living}} <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> no {{chromosomal}} structures are visible. Yet in the injured cell and after treatment with most histological fixatives chromatin structures become apparent. Under certain conditions this appearance of {{structure in the}} living <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> is reversible. We have found that this change in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{is the result of}} a change in the state of the chromosomes. In the living nucleus the chromosomes are in a greatly extended state, filling the entire nucleus. Upon injury the chromosomes condense and therefore become visible. At the same time the nuclear volume decreases. This behavior of the chromosomes is connected with their content of desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This view is based on the following observations: (a) Distribution of DNA in the Nucleus. —(1) The living <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> of uninjured cells absorbs diffusely at 2537 Å. No chromosomal structures are visible in ultraviolet photographs unless they are also distinct in ordinary light. If the chromosomes are made to condense they become visible and the absorption at 2537 Å is now localized in these structures. (2) After fixation with formalin and osmic acid interphase nuclei stain diffusely with Feulgen. These fixatives preserve the extended state of the chromosomes. (3) If nuclei are teased out in non-electrolytes (sucrose, glycerin) the chromosomes are extended. Such nuclei stain homogeneously with methyl green. On adding salts the chromosomes condense and the methyl green is now restricted to the visible structures. (b) Extension and Condensation of Isolated Chromosomes. —When chromosomes isolated from interphase nuclei of calf thymus are suspended in sucrose, their volume is four to five times larger than in saline, but they retain their characteristic shapes. Chromosomes from which DNA and histone have been removed do not show this reversible extension and condensation, neither do lampbrush chromosomes of frog oocytes which contain very little DNA. During mitosis a partial condensation of the DNA occurs in prophase, so that the mitotic chromosomes now occupy a much smaller volume of the nucleus. At telophase the chromosomes swell again to fill the entire nucleus...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{we showed}} that telomeres of normal cells are organized within the 3 D space of the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> in a nonoverlapping and cell cycle-dependent manner. This order is distorted in tumor cell nuclei where telomeres are found in close association forming aggregates of various numbers and sizes. Here we show that c-Myc overexpression induces telomeric aggregations in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Directly proportional to the duration of c-Myc deregulation, we observe three or five cycles of telomeric aggregate formation in interphase nuclei. These cycles reflect the onset and propagation of breakage-bridge-fusion cycles that are initiated by end-to-end telomeric fusions of chromosomes. Subsequent to initial chromosomal breakages, new fusions follow and the breakage-bridge-fusion cycles continue. During this time, nonreciprocal translocations are generated. c-Myc-dependent remodeling {{of the organization of}} telomeres thus precedes the onset of genomic instability and subsequently leads to chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings reveal that c-Myc possesses the ability to structurally modify chromosomes through telomeric fusions, thereby reorganizing the genetic information...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{investigated}} the spatial relationship between transcription sites and chromosome territories in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> of human female fibroblasts. Immunolabeling of nascent RNA was combined with visualization of chromosome territories by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Transcription sites were found scattered throughout the territory {{of one of the}} two X chromosomes, most likely the active X chromosome, and that of both territories of chromosome 19. The other X chromosome territory, probably the inactive X chromosome, was devoid of transcription sites. A distinct substructure was observed in interphase chromosome territories. Intensely labeled subchromosomal domains are surrounded by less strongly labeled areas. The intensely labeled domains had a diameter in the range of 300 – 450 nm and were sometimes interconnected, forming thread-like structures. Similar large scale chromatin structures were observed in HeLa cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged histone H 2 B. Strikingly, nascent RNA was almost exclusively found in the interchromatin areas in chromosome territories and in between strongly GFP-labeled chromatin domains. These observations support a model in which transcriptionally active chromatin in chromosome territories is markedly compartmentalized. Active loci are located predominantly at or near the surface of compact chromatin domains, depositing newly synthesized RNA directly into the interchromatin space.

40|$|Red {{blood cell}} protein 4. 1 (4. 1 R) is an 80 - kD {{erythrocyte}} phosphoprotein that stabilizes the spectrin/actin cytoskeleton. In nonerythroid cells, multiple 4. 1 R isoforms arise {{from a single}} gene by alternative splicing and predominantly code for a 135 -kD isoform. This isoform contains a 209 amino acid extension at its NH 2 terminus (head piece; HP). Immunoreactive epitopes specific for HP have been detected within the cell nucleus, nuclear matrix, centrosomes, {{and parts of the}} mitotic apparatus in dividing cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro binding assays, coimmunolocalization, and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we show that a 135 -kD 4. 1 R isoform specifically interacts with the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein. NuMA and 4. 1 R partially colocalize in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> of MDCK cells and redistribute to the spindle poles early in mitosis. Protein 4. 1 R associates with NuMA in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> and forms a complex with spindle pole organizing proteins, NuMA, dynein, and dynactin during cell division. Overexpression of a 135 -kD isoform of 4. 1 R alters the normal distribution of NuMA in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus.</b> The minimal sequence sufficient for this interaction has been mapped to the amino acids encoded by exons 20 and 21 of 4. 1 R and residues 1788 – 1810 of NuMA.

40|$|Dysplasia {{is linked}} to altered tissue architecture. The lesion belongs into the {{diagnostic}} field of human pathology and is highly relevant for the clinical physician, because it breaks the criteria of hyperplasia and regeneration. Dysplasia is a precancerous disorder leading in all probability to malignant transformation if not treated. However, different descriptions do apply for dysplasia in different human tissues, and conventional pathology cannot arrive at unequivocal stringency. In contrast to the previous situation, now, dysplasia is defined by a unifying concept, which works upon cell cycle criteria. The decisive element for the proposed definition is unbalanced segregation of chromosomes and persistent genomic asymmetry through telophase, leading to aneuploid <b>interphase</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Progress of dysplasia can be estimated from the frequency of pathologic mitoses that directly measure cellular proliferation. In routine work, progress of dysplasia shall be quantified by frequency increase of aneuploidy in the increasing fraction of proliferating <b>interphase</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Thus, dysplasia is defined not only by aberrations from healthy histological architecture and normal cytological differentiation, but also by violations of the DNA standard from mitotic nuclei.

Application of this bleached DAPI band (BDB) karyotyping method to the 45 S and 5 S rDNAs and 176 bp centromere satellite repeats distinguished the 10 B. rapa chromosomes.

Tests were carried out by premature chromosome condensation (PCC) and laser-UV-microirradiation of the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Rabl-orientation of chromosomes was observed in G 1 PCCs and G 2 PCCs. The cell nucleus was microirradiated in G 1 at one or two sites and pulse-labelled with 3 H-thymidine for 2 h. Cells were processed for autoradiography either immediately thereafter or after an additional growth period of 10 to 60 h. Autoradiographs show unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in the microirradiated nuclear part(s). The distribution of labelled chromatin was evaluated in autoradiographs from 1035 cells after microirradiation of a single nuclear site and from 253 cells after microirradiation of two sites. After 30 to 60 h postincubation the labelled regions still appeared coherent although the average size of the labelled nuclear area fr increased from 14. 2 % (0 h) to 26. 5 % (60 h). The relative distance dr, i. e. the distance between two microirradiated sites divided by the diameter of the whole nucleus, showed a slight decrease with increasing incubation time. Nine metaphase figures were evaluated for UDS-label after microirradiation of the nuclear edge in G 1. An average of 4. 3 chromosomes per cell were labelled. Several chromosomes showed joint labelling of both distal chromosome arms including the telomeres, while the centromeric region was free from label. This label pattern is interpreted {{as the result of a}} V-shaped orientation of these particular chromosomes in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nucleus</b> with their telomeric regions close to each other at the nuclear edge. Our data support the tested predictions of the Rabl-model.

However, the extent of formation of discrete chromosome-like structures correlates with the level of endogenous topo II present in the <b>interphase</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Our results further suggest that chromatin condensation in this extract may involve two processes: chromatin compaction and resolution into discrete chromosomes...|$|R
