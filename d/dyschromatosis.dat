50|$|Adenosine deaminases {{acting on}} RNA (ADAR) are enzymes {{responsible}} for binding to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I) by deamination. ADAR protein is a RNA-binding protein, which functions in RNA-editing through post-transcriptional modification of mRNA transcripts {{by changing the}} nucleotide content of the RNA. The conversion from A to I in the RNA disrupt the normal A:U pairing which makes the RNA unstable. Inosine is structurally {{similar to that of}} guanine (G) which leads to I to cytosine (C) binding. In RNA I functions the same as G in both translation and replication. Codon changes can arise from editing which may lead to changes in the coding sequences for proteins and their functions. Most editing site are found in noncoding regions of RNA such as untranslated regions (UTRs), Alu elements and long interspersed nuclear element (LINEs). Mutations in this gene have been associated with <b>dyschromatosis</b> symmetrica hereditaria, as well as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dyschromatosis</b> universalis hereditaria (DUH) and <b>dyschromatosis</b> symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) are {{pigmentary}} dermatoses {{most commonly}} seen in Japan. Both disorders usually show autosomal dominant inheritance, although {{in some cases}} autosomal recessive inheritance was reported. DSH was mapped to chromosome 1 q 21. 3, and mutations in the gene ADAR (DSRAD) were identified in Japanese, Chinese and Taiwanese families with autosomal dominant DSH. A second locus for <b>dyschromatosis</b> was mapped on chromosome 6 q 24. 2 -q 25. 2 in two Chinese families initially reported to be affected with DSH, but later suggested to have autosomal dominant DUH. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether one of these two loci is involved in the development of DUH in a consanguineous Bedouin family from Saudi Arabia with four affected and three unaffected sibs, clearly pointing to autosomal recessive inheritance. After excluding mutations in ADAR and linkage to the candidate regions on chromosomes 1 and 6, we performed an single nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide scan for linkage with other loci.

40|$|Background: The dyschromatoses are a {{group of}} {{disorders}} characterized by simultaneous hyperpigmented macules together with hypopigmented macules. <b>Dyschromatosis</b> universalis hereditaria (DUH) and <b>dyschromatosis</b> symmetrica hereditaria are two major types. While clinical and histological presentations are similar in these two diseases, genetic diagnosis is critical in the differential diagnosis of these entities.

All mutations detected on ADAR 1 and ABCB 6 genes were analyzed according to the frequency in control database, the mutation types, and the published evidence to determine the pathogenicity. Results: Family pedigree and clinical presentations were reported in 3 patients from two Chinese families. All patients have prominent cutaneous dyschromatoses involving the whole body without systemic complications. Different pathogenic genes in these patients with similar phenotype were identified: One novel mutation on ADAR 1 (c. 1325 C>G) and one recurrent mutation in ABCB 6 (c. 1270 T>C), which successfully distinguished two diseases with the similar phenotype.

40|$|<b>Dyschromatosis</b> symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) (also called “reticulate {{acropigmentation}} of Dohi”) is a pigmentary genodermatosis of {{autosomal dominant}} inheritance. We have clarified {{for the first}} time four pathological mutations of the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase gene (ADAR 1 or DSRAD) in four DSH pedigrees. In this paper, we report 16 novel mutations containing six missense substitutions (p. V 906 F, p. K 1003 R, p. G 1007 R, p. C 1036 S, p. S 1064 F, p. R 1078 C), two splice site mutations (IVS 2 + 2 T>G, IVS 8 + 2 T>A), six frameshift mutations (p. H 216 fs, p. K 433 fs, p. G 507 fs, p. P 727 fs, p. V 955 fs, p. K 1201 fs), and two nonsense mutations (p. R 426 X, p. Q 600 X) found in Japanese patients with DSH. We did not establish any clear correlation between the clinical phenotypes and the genotypes of ADAR 1 gene mutations in our examination of 16 cases plus four pedigrees. None of the different mutations identified in our studies of 20 cases suggested any founder effect. Furthermore, we did not identify any mutations in the ADAR 1 gene of three patients with <b>dyschromatosis</b> universalis hereditaria or three patients with acropigmentatio reticularis, indicating that the two diseases are completely different from DSH, although they have sometimes been suggested to be phenotypical variations of DSH...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Dyschromatosis</b> symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant cutaneous disorder caused by the mutations of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR 1) gene. We present a clinical and genetic study of seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH for mutations in the full coding sequence of ADAR 1 gene. Methods: ADAR 1 gene was sequenced in seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH and 120 controls. Functional significance of the observed ADAR 1 mutations was analyzed using PolyPhen 2, SIFT and DDIG-in. Results: We describe six novel mutations of the ADAR 1 gene in Chinese patients with DSH including a nonstop mutation p. Stop 1227 R, which was firstly reported in ADAR 1 gene. In silico analysis proves that all the mutations reported here are pathogenic. Conclusion: This study is useful for functional studies of the protein and to define a diagnostic strategy for mutation screening of the ADAR 1 gene.

40|$|<b>Dyschromatosis</b> universalis hereditaria (DUH) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis {{characterized}} by hyper- and hypopigmented macules which form a reticulate or mottled pattern. The causal gene and the precise pathogenesis of DUH have been unclear since the disease was initially reported in 1933. However, we found three heterozygous mutations encoding amino acid substitutions in SASH 1 in each of three nonconsanguineous DUH families. Immunohistochemistry and melanin staining showed distribution heterogenicity of melanocytes, predominantly melanized melanocytes in the epidermal tissues of a DUH patient. Specifically, we identified that mutations of SASH 1 can up-regulate resident melanogenic proteins, transport proteins of melanosome, and induce increased mobility of melanocytes in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SASH 1 was shown to interact with several proteins associated with melanogenesis in the MAPK signaling pathway and the endothelin signaling pathway, indicating an additional melanogenesis signaling pathway in the regulation of melanin biosynthesis. Collectively, these observations suggest that DUH is a heterogeneous disorder of increased production and transport of melanosomes caused by SASH 1 mutation together with melanocyte maldistribution...|$|E

In this study, two Chinese families with DSH were identified and subjected to a genomewide screen for linkage analysis. Two-point linkage analysis for pedigree A (maximum LOD score [Zmax] = 7. 28 at recombination fraction [θ] = 0. 00) and pedigree B (Zmax = 2. 41 at θ = 0. 00) mapped the locus for DSH in the two families to chromosome 6 q.

Methods: A retrospective review of clinical charts and archival photographs was performed for patients diagnosed with DSH in a medical center in Taiwan between 1992 and 2011. Results: A total of 25 patients (mean age at diagnosis 20. 3 years) were given the clinical diagnosis of DSH. The male:female ratio was 14 : 11. Positive family history was noted in 14 patients (56 %). The pattern of inheritance was basically autosomal dominant. Twelve patients (48 %) had typical hypo- and hyperpigmented macules distributed on the dorsal aspects of the extremities. Six patients (24 %) had coexistence of other diseases, particularly seizure, mental retardation, and autism.
