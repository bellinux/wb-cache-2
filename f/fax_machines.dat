25|$|The {{majority}} of Thompson's {{most popular and}} acclaimed work appeared within the pages of Rolling Stone magazine.

Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin' Wolf to Lou Reed.

One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) {{was said to have}} appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel. ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the Droste effect.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, modems made e-mail a viable {{alternative}} to Telex systems in a business environment. But individual e-mail accounts were not widely available until local Internet service providers were in place, although demand grew rapidly, as e-mail was seen as the Internet's killer app. It allowed anyone to email anyone, whereas previously, different system had been walled off from each other, such that America Online subscribers could email only other America Online subscribers, Compuserve subscribers could email only other Compuserve subscribers, etc. The broad user base created by the demand for e-mail smoothed the way for the rapid acceptance of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s. <b>Fax</b> <b>machines</b> were another technology that helped displace the telegram.|$|E
25|$|The {{subscription}} {{approach was}} the prevailing business model {{until the early}} 1970s, when Moody's, Fitch, and finally Standard & Poor's adopted the issuer-pays model. Several factors contributed to this transition, including increased investor demand for credit ratings, and widespread use of information sharing technology—such as <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> and photocopiers—which allowed investors to freely share agencies’ reports and undermined demand for subscriptions. Today, eight of the nine nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) use the issuer-pays model, only Egan-Jones maintains an investor subscription service. Smaller, regional credit rating agencies may use either model. For example, China's oldest rating agency, Chengxin Credit Management Co., uses the issuer-pays model. The Universal Credit Ratings Group, formed by Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating, Egan-Jones of the U.S. and Russia’s RusRatings, uses the investor-pays model, while Dagong Europe Credit Rating, the other joint-venture of Dagong Global Credit Rating, uses the issuer-pays model.|$|E

25|$|On 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay {{and people}} {{involved}} with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations. Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, {{as well as all}} other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three peopleGottfrid Svartholm, Mikael Viborg, and Fredrik Neijwere held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening. All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities.

25|$|Internet {{access in}} an act of {{unprecedented}} Internet censorship. About 3,500 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 12:10am to 12:35am 28 January. The shutdown happened within the space of a few tens of minutes, not instantaneously. According to Renesys, Telecom Egypt started shutting down at 12:12am, Raya/Vodafone at 12:13am, Link Egypt at 12:17am, Etisalat Misr at 12:19am, and Internet Egypt at 12:25am. Renesys interpreted the shutdown as people getting phone calls one at a time, telling them to take themselves off the air, rather than an automated system taking all providers down at once. Facebook confirmed a decrease in traffic from Egypt. A Border Gateway Protocol monitoring site in Vancouver, Canada, reported most of the primary AS (ISPs) dropping a large percentage if not all of route advertisements. Virtually all of Egypt's Internet addresses were unreachable, worldwide. In response, Egyptians used smartphones as modems, and even land lines with dial-up modems to make international calls to access the internet, <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> in universities and embassies, and ham radio to circumvent the restrictions. Furthermore, the sole remaining functioning ISP, Noor, which had had eight percent of the market share in Egypt (but which connected the Egyptian stock market and many western companies to the outside world), has been reported by Tor, an anonymity network, on 30 January to be the source of a quadrupling of Tor clients from Egypt within twenty-four hours as of 30 January; the use of Tor has skyrocketed due to the situation in Egypt.|$|E

500|$|When {{independence}} was achieved in 1991, the ARF soon {{became one of}} the major and most active political parties, rivaled mainly by the Pan-Armenian National Movement. Subsequently, on December 28, 1994, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in a famous television speech banned the ARF, which was the nation's leading opposition party, along with Yerkir, the country's largest daily newspaper. Ter-Petrosyan introduced evidence that supposedly detailed a plot hatched by the ARF to engage in terrorism against his administration, endanger Armenia's national security and overthrow the government. Throughout the evening, government security forces arrested leading ARF figures, and police seized computers, <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> files and printing equipment from ARF offices. In addition to Yerkir, government forces also closed several literary, women's, cultural, and youth publications.

500|$|The genesis for [...] "Blood" [...] was Glen Morgan's own hematophobia, {{combined}} with the controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California and a note between writers Morgan and Wong that simply read [...] "Postal Workers". In addition, series creator Chris Carter had been wanting an episode of The X-Files to feature a story revolving around digital readouts. Morgan and Wong {{decided to use the}} digital readout idea, crafting a script that turned [...] "regular things," [...] like <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> and cell phones, into something [...] "scary." [...] The 1966 shooting massacre at the University of Texas was the inspiration for the story's climax, which was only partially filmed at the University of British Columbia because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university. A replica of its clock tower's interior was used for several key scenes. This episode marks the first time that Darin Morgan, Glen's brother, helped with a script of The X-Files with a [...] "story by" [...] credit. Darin was asked to help flesh out the episode's story. He would later contribute to the second season episode [...] "Humbug".|$|E
