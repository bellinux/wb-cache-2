The <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> allowed that, whereas the standard engine would have overheated above 600 horsepower, the engine with exhaust ejectors cooled at take-off operating conditions at zero ram. The exhaust ejectors provided as much cooling with cowl flaps closed as the conventional cowl flaps induced when full open at low airspeeds. The propulsive thrust of the exhaust-ejector installation was calculated to be slightly less than the thrust of the collector-ring-installation...|$|R
40|$|Desk {{study is}} an {{essential}} part of all civil engineering project <b>ground</b> <b>investigations.</b> It is usually a collation and review of existing data and information about a site and, in some cases, the surrounding area, and carried out at an early stage of the <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> to inform and guide the <b>ground</b> <b>investigation.</b> It should provide suitable data and information to assess the ground conditions and the implications for the proposed engineering design. A similar approach can be taken to inform local, regional or national government with regard to development and the redevelopment of urban areas where <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> data and information are available. This paper describes a spatially defined geotechnical information system (GIS) designed to provide geological, geotechnical and geoenvironmental data and information for Glasgow City Council (Scotland). The system contains three main parts: the geology (bedrock, Quaternary and artificial deposits and the thickness and depth of these deposits); the data are presented as various summary graphs illustrating the variation of various parameters as well as a geotechnical and geoenvironmental database; and tools specifically developed to present the data. As undermining is a hazard in part of Glasgow, a dataset showing the distribution of mining is included. Further interpretation of the characteristics of the geological units has produced an engineering geological classification which may be used to provide rapid assessment of the engineering geological conditions...|$|R

40|$|Implementation of mega {{geotechnical}} engineering projects {{requires a}} systematic approach and detailed planning. A mega land reclamation and ground improvement project {{which consists of}} various components of geotechnical engineering applications was planned and implemented in the Republic of Singapore from 1990 till 2005, a total period of {{one and a half}} decades. Due to the extensive ground improvement required to treat the underlying highly compressible soil, with the presence of highly variable ground profile and ground conditions due to the natural geological process, a detailed <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> was necessary. This was furthermore necessary due to the importance of various critical infrastructure planned for future usage in the land reclamation site. Extensive <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> was planned based on input from desk study and reconnaissance survey carried out using geophysical method under foreshore conditions. Progressive <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> included <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> carried out in foreshore area prior to land reclamation, on land prior to ground improvement, during and after ground improvement to assess the degree of improvement. The <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> involved large numbers of in-situ tests using numerous methods and collections and testing of undisturbed soil sample for further laboratory testing to drive necessary geotechnical parameters for design purpose or decision making for acceptance of ground improvement works. Due to the nature and speed of the project on-site geotechnical and geotextile laboratories were set up for characterization and quality control. In addition to the improvement of underlying soils, hydraulically filled granular soils were required to be densified by application of deep compaction methods to minimize future immediate settlement and to increase resistance to liquefaction. A large quantity of geotechnical instrumentation were installed and monitored for construction control as well as performance monitoring of ground improvement works. This paper describes the procedure and process of implementation of geotechnical works in the mega Changi East Land Reclamation and Ground Improvement project in Singapore...|$|R

40|$|Surtees Bridge, {{which carries}} the A 66 (T) over the River Tees near Thornaby-on-Tees in the UK, has been {{showing signs of}} {{distress}} that predate its opening in 1981. Subsequent investigations {{have shown that the}} bridge distress is related to unexpectedly large settlement of the eastern approach embankment. Recent <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> prompted by a proposed widening of the river crossing have produced many new data on the alluvial deposits underlying the site, and explain why embankment settlement was so much larger than originally anticipated. Comparison of the geotechnical parameters obtained from the original and more recent <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> suggests that the original investigation significantly underestimated the thickness of an alluvial clay layer underlying the site, an...|$|R
40|$|A site {{investigation}} covers three stages, a preliminary {{appreciation of the}} site, a <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> i which borings and laboratory testing are undertaken, and a final stage in which the conclusions ofthe <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> are checked against the actual ground conditions as revealed by the constructional excavations. This paper considers the planning and implementation f the <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> under conditions normally prevailing in the British Isles. Various procedures are described for boring in soils and rocks, for trial excavations, for probing, and for geophysical surveying. Sampling procedures are considered {{on the basis of}} the quality of the sample thus obtained. Sample quality ranges between almost fully-undisturbed soil samples as taken by a thin-wall piston sampler, and fully disturbed samples taken from the driU tools. The choice of procedure for boring and sampling isdetermined by the technical require-ments of the investigation, by the practical problems arising from site conditions and by economy. It is considered that investigations should start using standard equipment and that the moIe sophisticated and expensive procedures should be employed only when the nature of the geotechnical problem has been determined. The paper concludes with a discussion of the management and organization of {{site investigation}}s. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{assessment}} of the geotechnical data and engineering geology characteristics of the Quaternary deposits identified from <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> for the M 6 and M 74 extension corridor from Carlisle to Kirkpatrick- Fleming, connecting the motorway network between Scotland and England. The work was carried out under the Quaternary of the South of Scotland Project (BGS Integrated Geoscience Surveys (North) Programme). The <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> for the road extension are from M 74 Beattock to M 6 Ecclechan to Carlisle (1988), A 74 M Glasgow to Carlisle Trunk Road (M 74 Gretna to Kirkpatrick-Fleming) (1989) and M 6 Extension to Scottish Border). The data from the <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> were added to the National Geotechnical Properties Database with a lithostratigraphical code using information supplied by A A McMillan and J W Merritt based on the findings of a new survey of the Quaternary geology of the Solway. Assessment of geotechnical data was used to describe the engineering geological characteristics of the deposits encountered and specifically it provided guidance on the origin of some problematical deposits, which could be either weathered bedrock or Quaternary glaciolacustrine deposits...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of major {{construction}} works, the better the ground conditions are known, the more control there is on the assessment of risks for construction, contract and personnel, and ultimately on final costs. Understanding of the ground conditions is usually expressed as a conceptual ground model that is informed {{by the results of}} desk study and of dedicated <b>ground</b> <b>investigation.</b> Using the GSI 3 D software, a 3 D geological model (a model composed of attributed solid volumes, rather than of surfaces) can be constructed that exactly honours geologists’ interpretations of the data. The data are used in their true 3 D position. The 3 D model of faulted Lambeth Group (Palaeogene) strata {{in the area of the}} proposed new Crossrail Farringdon underground station, in central London, has several types of benefit. These include allowing optimum use of available <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> data, including third party data, with confidence. The model provides an understanding of the local geological structure that had not been possible using other commonly used methods: in particular, it shows the likely distribution of numerous water-bearing coarse deposits and their faulted offsets, which has potentially significant effects on groundwater control. The model can help to focus <b>ground</b> <b>investigation,</b> constrain design and control ris...|$|R

The study population comprised 66 general practices in the Grampian region of Scotland referring 959 patients. The outcome measures were compliance with guidelines (number of recommended investigations completed), number of general practice consultations, the number and case mix of referrals, waiting time to initial hospital appointment, and the number of patients with a management decision reached at initial appointment and discharged by 12 months after referral. Results: GPs' compliance with referral guidelines increased (difference in means 0. 5; 95...|$|R
