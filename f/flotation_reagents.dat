50|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{an important}} concentration process. This process {{can be used to}} separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound {{to the surface of the}} bubbles. The driving force for this attachment is the change in the surface free energy when the attachment occurs. These bubbles rise through the slurry and are collected from the surface. To enable these particles to attach, careful consideration of the chemistry of the pulp needs to be made. These considerations include the pH, Eh and the presence of <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents.</b> The pH is important as it changes the charge of the particles surface and the Eh affects the chemisorption of collectors on the surface of the particles.|$|E

40|$|Cryogenic {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (cryo-SEM), image analysis (IA) of SEM micrographs and X-ray microtomography (XMT) were used to obtain new information about the morphology of iron ore green pellets in this work. Cryo-SEM and freeze fracturing was used to observe entrapped air bubbles and arrangement of particles around the bubbles and in the matrix of wet green pellets. The observations of samples prepared by plunge and unidirectional freezing indicate that unidirectional freezing facilitates the observation of entrapped bubbles with minimum formation of artifacts, whereas plunge freezing enables observation {{of the degree of}} water filling at the outer surface of wet pellets with minimum amount of artifacts. It was also observed in the wet pellets that the size of the water domains in the matrix is quite small and the finer grains are mixed with coarser grains resulting in a denser matrix, whereas no fine grains were observed {{in the vicinity of the}} air bubbles. Two types of pellets prepared with and without addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> prior to balling were studied using IA and XMT. IA of scanning electron micrographs of epoxy impregnated pellets was used to separate bubble porosity from packing porosity and to quantify the former. The individual SEM micrographs acquired by a backscattered electron detector were reconstructed to provide the entire two-dimensional (2 D) sections of the pellets. The 2 D data obtained by IA were unfolded to three-dimensional (3 D) by stereology and relatively good agreement with XMT data was observed. The size and amount of air bubbles could be quantified with both techniques. The addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> was found to increase the number of entrapped air bubbles and slightly decrease the median bubble diameter. The additional entrapped air bubbles due to the addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> was shown to be responsible for the difference in total porosity observed by mercury porosimetry between the two types of pellets. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) is shown in this work to produce inappropriate results with regard to the porosity due to bubble entrapment, it only provides values for total porosity and the throat size distribution of the porosity. In summary, this work has shown that cryo-SEM, IA of SEM micrographs and XMT are powerful and very useful methods for characterization of the morphology of iron ore green pellets.

40|$|Abstract The {{fundamental}} {{formation of}} the three phase contact in flotation is an intensively and controversially discussed phenomenon and the contact angle method is usually employed to characterise the wettability of solid surfaces. A more recent technique to explore the hydrophobicity of solid particulate phases is inverse gas chromatography (iGC) {{which is used to}} quantify the wettability of solid surfaces through thermodynamic parameters. In this article, the recently introduced net free energy of interaction between particles and bubbles immersed in water ΔGpwb is derived from the surface free energy analysis and its correlation to the flotability of solid phases is evaluated. At the same time, a more detailed analysis on the action of <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> is presented performing iGC measurements under dry and flotation experiments under aqueous conditions. In general, <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> have to satisfy required features to adsorb selectively, render the solid surface wetting property sufficiently, and comply current regulations concerning the preservation of the environment.

From the separated dixantogenate and xanthate a laboratory synthesis of thioncarbamates is given. In addition, a semi-industrial treatment of waste xanthate is presented. Synthesis of N-alkyl and N,N-dialkyl-O-isobutylthioncarbamates were obtained from the filtrate obtained in the first step. As a by-product, sodium thioglycolate was produced. This by-product is transformed to a thioglycolic acid by the addition of an acid. Also, the synthesis of thioncarbamates from dixanthogenates, isolated from industrial waste as a cake, is desribed.

Although the flotation process is considered economical in the desilication of Chinese diasporic bauxite, the existing collectors fail to separate these ores because of their poor adsorption selectivity over other minerals. The present study was an attempt to seek a collector for selective flotation of diaspore over aluminosilicates. A novel carboxyl hydroxamic acid compound, 2, 2 -bis(hydroxycarbamoyl) decanoic acid (BHDA), was designed and synthesized, and the flotation behavior of diaspore, kaolinite, and illite was investigated by flotation tests with BHDA. The interactions between the BHDA and the minerals were also explored by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), zeta-potential measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Using BHDA as the collector, the pulp pH value affected the floatability of diaspore significantly while the floatability of kaolinite or illite was unaffected or only slightly affected. The dosage of BHDA had little effect on the floatability of the three minerals. The greatest difference in floatability between diaspore and aluminosilicates occurred at mid-range pulp pH (7). Large shifts in characteristic absorption peaks and new absorption peaks were observed for BHDA-treated diaspore but were absent from BHDA-treated aluminosilicates.

The <b>reagents</b> used were sodium oleate as collector and sodium silicate as depressants and sodium hydroxide as pH regulators of flotation studies {{it has been}} observed from the size analysis that, that the liberation of calcite and silica is greater to some extent in the finer size...|$|R
