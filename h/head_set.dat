25|$|On Saturday morning, June 25, 1977, Sullivan {{was struck}} while fishing in a {{freshwater}} pool. The lightning hit {{the top of}} his <b>head,</b> <b>set</b> his hair on fire, traveled down, and burnt his chest and stomach. Sullivan turned to his car when something unexpected occurred — a bear approached the pond and tried to steal trout from his fishing line. Sullivan had the strength and courage to strike the bear with a tree branch. He claimed that this was the twenty-second time he hit a bear with a stick in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the breastbone {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the <b>head,</b> <b>set</b> at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E
25|$|Threatened with treason {{charges and}} lacking support, York, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. The Nevilles {{returned}} {{to win the}} Battle of Northampton, where they captured Henry. When Richard joined them, he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne, then forcing through the Act of Accord, which stated that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime, but would be succeeded by York. Margaret found this disregarding of her son's claims unacceptable and so the conflict continued. York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his <b>head</b> <b>set</b> on display at Micklegate Bar, {{along with those of}} his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who had both been captured and beheaded.|$|E

25|$|The 13th-century south aisle {{contains}} the church square-paneled and plank south door, that is recessed {{to the same}} style as the chancel south door. A further small plank door at the south aisle north-east wall is within a pointed doorway with a continuous moulded surround, an entrance to a previous rood loft, defined externally by the south aisle turret. To {{the east of the}} door are twin aumbries. In the south wall is a 14th-century piscina with cusped <b>head,</b> <b>set</b> within an ogee headed recess. The north aisle, also 13th-century, contains within {{the north side of the}} chancel arch pier a further piscina with a seven-cusped arch surround with spandrels within a rectilinear frame, this sitting on a projecting ledge, with above, an entablature containing three floriate carvings; running on the entablature are crenellations. In the north wall is a further aumbry with wooden door. At the west end of the north aisle sits the church organ.|$|E
500|$|Trumble {{was tall}} and thin, [...] in height. His long face {{featured}} prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling. The cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Trumble: [...] "El Greco, with his lengthening touch {{would have liked to}} draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped <b>head</b> <b>set</b> on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start."

500|$|Wolstencroft {{wrote the}} death {{scene with the}} {{intention}} of giving the audience the impression {{that no one in the}} series is safe. According to producer Jane Featherstone, the idea to kill off a main character involved a female getting [...] "her <b>head</b> <b>set</b> on fire" [...] later in the series, but she decided [...] "let's move the most dramatic thing you've got to episode two and kill off the only actress the audience recognise [...] and then you've got them hooked." [...] Matthew Macfadyen stated that the shooting of the death scene, although not emotionally draining, was rather tough, and gruelling to perform. The part where Osbourne forces Flynn's arm into the fryer was done with a rubber arm made to double Faulkner's arm. Furthermore, the [...] "oil" [...] was in fact cold tea with food colour.|$|E

500|$|When Henry VI had {{a mental}} breakdown, Richard was named regent, but {{the birth of}} a male heir {{resolved}} the question of succession. [...] When Henry's sanity returned, the court party reasserted its authority, but Richard of York and the Nevilles defeated them at a skirmish called the First Battle of St Albans. The ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted. York and the Nevilles fled abroad, but the Nevilles returned to win the Battle of Northampton, where they captured Henry. When Richard of York joined them he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne and forcing through the Act of Accord, which stated that Henry would remain as king for his lifetime, but would be succeeded by York. Margaret found this disregard for her son's claims unacceptable, and so the conflict continued. York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his <b>head</b> <b>set</b> on display at Micklegate Bar along with those of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who had been captured and beheaded. The Scottish queen Mary of Guelders provided Margaret with support but London welcomed York's son Edward, Earl of March and Parliament confirmed that Edward should be made king. He was crowned after consolidating his position with victory at the Battle of Towton.|$|E
2500|$|Owain {{remained}} free {{but now he}} was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt {{continued to}} splutter on. In 1410, Owain readied his supporters for a last raid deep into Shropshire. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It may have been a last desperate suicide raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. Rhys Ddu ("Black Rhys") of Cardigan, one of Owain’s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: [...] "…laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his <b>head</b> <b>set</b> on London Bridge." [...] Philip Scudamore and Rhys ap Tudur were also beheaded and their heads displayed at Shrewsbury and Chester (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when Jacob left Beersheba for Haran, {{he stopped at}} {{a place for the}} night, using a stone for a pillow. He dreamed that he saw a ladder to heaven on which God's angels ascended and descended. And God stood beside him and promised to give him and his {{numerous}} descendants the land on which he lay, said that through his descendants all the earth would be blessed, and promised to stay with him wherever he went and bring him back to the land. Jacob awoke afraid, remarked that surely the place was the house of God, the gate of heaven, and called the place Bethel (although the Canaanites had called the city Luz). Jacob took the stone from under his <b>head,</b> <b>set</b> it up as a pillar, and poured oil on it. And Jacob vowed that if God would stay with him, give him bread and clothing, and return him to his father's house in peace, then God would be his god, the stone pillar would be God's house, and he would give God a tenth of what he received.

2500|$|Numerous {{articles}} by Chumbley followed, published in British and American occult journals, but no further books appeared until ONE: The Grimoire of the Golden Toad in 2000, described by Xoanon as: [...] "...the first full grimoire-text to treat specifically and from personal {{account of the}} Traditional East Anglian ritual called 'The Waters of the Moon': the solitary initiation of the so-called 'Toad-witch'." [...] The purpose of this traditional folk-magical rite is to obtain a specific bone from the flensed corpse of a toad; the bone is believed to bestow certain powers upon its owner, primarily control of animals. Chumbley's ONE, however, presents a thoroughly antinomian re-visioning of the ritual procedure and its results, combining ritual practice {{with a series of}} dramatic visions recounted in prose-poetry. In Chumbley's recension it becomes clear that the [...] "animal" [...] over which power is sought is the practitioner's own human self. Seventy-seven hand-bound copies of the book were offered for sale, each copy accompanied by a hand-written page of a sigillic [...] "inner grimoire", signed by the author, and an envelope containing a hand-painted talisman made from antique toadskin leather and a single blackthorn. A further three copies were retained [...] "for internal distribution"; these were bound in leather with an actual toad's <b>head</b> <b>set</b> into the front cover, with toadskin leather panelling on the rear.|$|E
