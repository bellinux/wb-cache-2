40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel steady-state identification (SSI) method {{based on the}} auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX). This method allows the SSI with reduced tuning by analyzing the identifiability properties of the system. In particular, the singularity of the model matrices is used as an index for steady-state determination. In this contribution, the novel SSI method is compared to other available techniques, namely the F-like test, wavelet transform and a polynomial-based approach. These methods are implemented for SSI of three different case studies. In the first case, a simulated dataset is used for calibrating the output-based SSI methods. The second case corresponds to a literature nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) example running at different steady states in which the ARX-based approach is tuned with the available input-output data. Finally, an industrial case with real data of a depropanizer column from PETROBRAS S. A. considering different pieces of equipment is analyzed. The results for a reflux <b>drum</b> <b>case</b> indicate that the wavelet and the F-like test can satisfactorily detect the steady-state periods after careful tuning and when respecting their hypothesis, i. e., smooth data for the wavelet method {{and the presence of}} variance in the data for the F-like test. Through a heat exchanger case with different measurement frequencies, we demonstrate the advantages of using the ARX-based method over the other techniques, which include the aspect of online implementation...|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{evaluate}} whether virus infection {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in children was undertaken with cytological observation of their middle ear fluids, twenty-one being mucoid and two serous of twenty-three ears. Despite the categorization of the fluids from chronic otitis media with effusions, the dominant type of inflammatory cell was neutrophil in all 23 ears. Multinucleated cells were observed in thirteen of 23 cases. These cells seemed to have arisen from epithelial cells of the middle ear mucosa. Therefore, it is suggested that some virus may be involved in the etiology of otitis media with effusion. In ten cases of blue ear drum, numerous macrophages, lymphocytes and red blood cells were seen in their fluids. The condition of blue ear drum appeared to be based on a delayed-type hyper-sensitivity reaction. However, the role of virus infection in blue ear <b>drum</b> <b>cases</b> is unclear. Therefore, further virus study of middle ear fluids from otitis media with effusions and the condition of blue ear drum should be carried out...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates {{maintenance}} treatment followed by different Districts of New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In addition, two case {{studies on the}} use of old pavement materials, called the “millings”, in maintenance projects are reported. Based on this study, it is observed that none of the Districts have a written procedure for maintenance work. Rather Districts rely on the experience of the maintenance crew for conducting maintenance projects. All Districts prefer to use chip seal for maintenance irrespective of distress conditions of the pavements. Patching and crack sealing are usually done before chip sealing to extend the life of the chip seals. Sand seal, scrub seal, and slurry seal projects are not done by District maintenance crews but by outside contractors. It is also observed that all Districts are interested in using millings in maintenance projects and most have already used millings in at least one maintenance project with some success and failure. Most of the Districts have used coarse fraction of millings in chip seal projects successfully. However, they failed to find a proper way to process the fine fractions of millings. Case Study I shows that fine millings can be used to construct thin overlay when mixed with emulsion in pug mill or hot <b>drums.</b> <b>Case</b> Study II concludes that fine millings can be used as fine/sand seal successfully following the same procedure and using the same equipment as chip seal...|$|R
