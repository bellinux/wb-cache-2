Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed.

40|$|Extract] Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia, and several other countries worldwide. As a result of mining operations, very large underground openings are created that are later backfilled to provide regional stability. The large underground voids that are backfilled are called stopes, and they can be approximated as rectangular prisms, which can be more than 100 m in depth. Backfilling is also seen as an effective means of disposing the by-products of the mineral processing called tailings that are left after the valuable minerals are extracted from the ore. There are several types of mine <b>fills</b> such as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills,</b> cemented <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills,</b> paste fills, aggregate fills, cemented aggregate fills, and rock fills that are based on combinations of surface process tailings, and development waste or quarried rock. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>fills</b> have often been considered as the conventional mine fill materials, primarily owing to their widespread usage throughout Australia: in Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia...|$|R

Loose granular soil is susceptible to liquefaction upon the impact of dynamic forces. Even under static conditions, loose granular soil may be subjected to bearing capacity failure and large settlements, because of its low shearing resistance and high compressibility. Various densification methods are used for improving such soils to increase the friction angle and elastic modulus. Several methods of deep compaction are available for such applications; among these, dynamic compaction {{is one of the}} most effective ways of densifying granular soils to a significant depth.

50|$|Borrow pits {{containing}} suitable material {{are accessible}} at an elevation {{such that the}} earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> {{is likely to be}} the most economic method of construction. Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a dredge pump. In the construction of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> dam, the edges of the dam are defined by low embankments or dykes which are built upward as the fill progresses. The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The sluices discharge their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by discharge control. While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later.|$|E

The method allows reconstitution of homogeneous, saturated specimens of sands containing fines whose stress-strain response closely resembles the stress-strain response of natural soil deposits formed underwater (e. g., alluvial and offshore submarine deposits, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills,</b> and tailings dams). A procedure is described to evaluate the maximum void ratio (emax) of sands containing fines under conditions that more appropriately represent soil deposition at its loosest state in aquatic environments.
