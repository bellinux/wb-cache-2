5|$|The {{population}} of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000. Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> of Paris with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected {{infrastructure of the}} city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.|$|E
5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely <b>elected</b> <b>government.</b> The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E
5|$|Among he restive {{regions of}} the new nation was the North-West Frontier Province. The {{referendum}} there. in July 1947 had been tainted by low electoral turnou,t as less than 10 {{percent of the population}} were allowed to vote. On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> of Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan. Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite his being a Kashmiri.

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions gripped the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all else, a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly <b>elected</b> <b>government.</b> West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E

5|$|Higginbotham was {{involved}} in the transition to open democratic elections in South Africa. He had visited South Africa in 1982 with other black jurists and had been appalled by the racial oppression he found and analogized to before the American Civil War. After apartheid's demise, Higginbotham consulted with Nelson Mandela and founded the South Africa Free Election (SAFE) Fund. He raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa, and served as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. After the election, he helped South Africa's newly <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> draft a new constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1974–75, the {{reception}} and meeting rooms were further upgraded with {{extensive use of}} imported goods from the West. However, over time, Altes Stadthaus became less important to the GDR government. Important events, celebrations and ceremonies {{took place in the}} Rotes Rathaus, the Palace of the Republic or the State Council Building. The historical high point {{in the use of the}} building under the GDR came in its final phase, when the only freely <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> of East Germany, under Lothar de Maizière relocated there. The provisions of the agreement on German reunification were therefore negotiated there.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E

40|$|Within a Gramscian analysis, {{concepts}} of hegemony, passive revolution and organic intellectuals are employed {{to investigate and}} theorise the New Right think tanks' critique of English local government. Unlike other accounts, {{it is argued that}} the New Right think tanks successfully modernised traditional Conservative party concerns that <b>elected</b> local <b>government</b> was susceptible to demands for social welfare and of bureaucrats and politicians self-seeking efforts. The Gramscian analysis further suggests that in a highly centralised state <b>elected</b> local <b>government</b> was never only concerned with locality but was often embroiled in the statecraft strategy if the dominant bloc. Previously when the dominant hegemony had been endangered, <b>elected</b> local <b>government</b> has been usefully deployed to resolve social tensions. This strategy however, has been problematic and has been destructive of the relative independence of <b>elected</b> local <b>government.</b> More generally, <b>elected</b> local <b>government's</b> decisive role in civil society means that it too has become a site where counter hegemonic projects have clustered. During the 1980 s, such tensions become critical. The organic intellectuals associated with Thatcherism, the New Right think tanks, acted as a clarion for demands to end <b>elected</b> local <b>government's</b> role in providing social welfare that effectively questioned its existence. Elswhere in a parallel development increased regulation of <b>elected</b> local <b>government</b> by the centre restricted the activities of local authorities, a strategy that also adversly affected those who supported the dominant bloc's hegemony...|$|R
25|$|A further {{approach}} to the Charter, taken by the courts, is the dialogue principle, which involves greater participation by <b>elected</b> <b>governments.</b> This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.|$|R
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky was a shadow government {{established for the}} Commonwealth of Kentucky by a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War. The shadow government never replaced the <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> in Frankfort, which had strong Union sympathies. Neither was it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended {{only as far as}} Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the Confederate States of America, and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{passed an}} ordinance of secession {{and established a}} provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. Burnett, William Preston of Fayette County and William E. Simms of Bourbon County were chosen as commissioners for the provisional government and were dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to negotiate with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. Luke P. Blackburn, a native Kentuckian living in Mississippi, was invited to accompany the commissioners. Despite the fact that Kentucky's <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> in Frankfort had opposed secession, the commissioners convinced Davis to recommend Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy; the Confederate Congress officially admitted Kentucky on December 10, 1861.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was {{reinstated}} in the army and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, her brother-in-law, King Constantine of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically <b>elected</b> <b>government</b> of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so untenable that she {{and other members of the}} Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.|$|E
