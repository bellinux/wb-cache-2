This paper looks at immersive spaces as soft and <b>hard</b> <b>technologies.</b> Soft technologies are technologies enabling creative and flexible use, while <b>hard</b> <b>technologies</b> embed processes that limit creativity but provide efficiency {{and freedom from}} error. Technologies may be softened or hardened by assembly. For instance, if your Learning Management System (LMS) has no wiki, then it may be softened by adding one from outside the system. If your wiki has no assessment management system, then it may be hardened by using a LMS. For learning, the intrinsically soft nature of immersive spaces sometimes requires scaffolded hardening. This paper {{provides an example of}} an ongoing project that realizes these soft and <b>hard</b> <b>technologies</b> in an immersive virtual space and discusses the rich potential of such spaces for technology assembly...|$|R

The emphasis on <b>hard</b> <b>technology</b> has prevented technology education from widening its scope and thus catering {{to the needs of}} a changing society. This chapter first briefly identifies the common definitions of soft and hard technologies. It then argues that technology education should emphasize both hard and soft technologies. Through a case study of Hong Kong, the chapter identifies the issues surrounding the inclusion of soft technology in the technology curriculum. The issues comprise the outdated perceptions of the government and schools with respect to technology, teachers' backgrounds, and students' abilities.

Shortening product life cycle, increasingly shopisticated customers, increasing labor costs and volatility in input prices {{has created an}} environment where manufacturers must be flexible, adaptive, responsive and innovative.   Advances Manufacturing Technologies (AMTs) and new management practices provide an organization with an opportunity to successfully compabt market place dynamic and create for itself a competitive advantage.   Manufacturers and academics believe that AMTs (<b>hard</b> <b>technology)</b> dan soft technology can improve manufacturing flexibility and lead time to market. This paper is based on an empirical study of one eighty three companies in six industry groups in Indonesia. The main goal of this paper is three folds. Firstly is to document the level of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMTs) and soft technology adoption by Indonesian large manufacturing firms. Secondly is to the effect of technology on manufacturing flexibility. Finnaly is to investigate the moderating role of availability of resources on technology-manufacturing flexibility relationship.

40|$|Past {{empirical}} studies {{have investigated the}} effect of <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> on different measures of performance in the operations area. The term ‘hard technologies’ refers to hardware and the associated software consisting of technologies such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines, flexible manufacturing systems, robotics, etc., whilst ‘soft technologies’ refers to manufacturing techniques and know-how and includes Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing and Total Quality Management (TQM). Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) conceptualization of the firm as a bundle of resources, this study argues {{that the relationship between}} <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> and competitive performance can be additive and interactive. Hence it seeks to advance previous studies in two main ways. Firstly, differing from previous studies that generally consider the effects of either <b>hard</b> or soft <b>technologies</b> on manufacturing performance, this study brings the two types of resources (<b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies)</b> into one study and examines their additive effects. As suggested by the RBV, {{it is important to understand}} the unique roles of the different types of resources on improving different types of performance. Investigating these unique effects is important in guiding managers to align the types of resources and the competitive goals pursued by firms. Secondly, this study investigates the interaction between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> in predicting different types of manufacturing performance. Drawing on the RBV, the concept of complementarity, and Socio-Technical System (STS) Theory, this study examines how the interaction between these two types of resources can be synergistic; this occurs when one resource magnifies the impact of another, multiplying the common effect. However, to date there have been very few {{empirical studies}} examining the effects of synergistic relationships between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> on multiple types of manufacturing performance. In addition, this study investigates the effects of <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> on different types of performance in the context of an emerging economy, Thailand. Most research has been conducted in the context of advanced economies. There have been very few studies aimed at understanding operations management issues in emerging economies. Hence research is needed to examine whether findings from studies conducted in advanced economies also apply in emerging economies such as Thailand’s. A two-phase design was implemented in this research. The first phase comprised a quantitative, self-administered mail survey, completed by managers from 186 manufacturing plants in Thailand. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test 12 hypotheses about the effects of <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> on cost, product quality, lead time and flexibility performance. In the second phase, qualitative interviews were conducted with eight senior/middle managers from four plants to explore and further integrate the quantitative findings in greater depth. There are two major findings from this study relating to the drivers of high performance that have implications for the operations management discipline and practitioners. Firstly, <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> are shown as significantly and positively related to the four types of manufacturing performance (cost, product quality, lead time and flexibility performance), hence emphasizing the importance of both <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> and confirming their additive relationship. The results also suggest that <b>hard</b> <b>technologies</b> have a relatively stronger relationship with flexibility, cost, and lead time, whilst soft technologies have a stronger relationship with product quality. This study therefore highlights the importance of understanding the unique roles of resources in improving different types of performance as suggested by the RBV. It also offers useful insight into firms’ technology justification. Secondly, the significant, positive interaction between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> in predicting the four types of manufacturing performance represents the synergistic relationships between these two types of technologies. This study has found that development of either <b>hard</b> or soft <b>technologies</b> may be sufficient for incrementally improving performance. Akin to the RBV, the concept of complementarity and the STS, consideration of the synergistic relationship between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>technologies</b> offers an opportunity for multiplying their common effect. Because many manufacturing firms have invested enormous capital in manufacturing technologies over the last three decades, it is important for decision makers to understand costs and benefits from the usage and applicability of these technologies to their companies. Additionally, the results also confirm that the RBV, the concept of complementarity and the STS, originally developed in advanced economies, are applicable in an emerging economy such as Thailand...|$|R

O presente estudo consiste de uma análise secundária de uma investigação prévia que teve o propósito de descobrir maneiras saudáveis de lidar com condições inerentes às pessoas com diabetes mellitus. O estudo original foi desenvolvido com um grupo de onze pessoas em condições de diabetes. Esta análise secundária teve como referencial o modelo de tecnologias de Merhy et al. (1997) que as classificam como: tecnologias duras, tecnologias leve-duras e tecnologias leves. Para a análise secundária utilizamos à técnica de narrativas. Os resultados revelaram ruídos, ou seja, sinais de alerta de que algo no cotidiano dos participantes não estava de acordo com o esperado. Esses ruídos abrem possibilidades para construir um novo modelo de cuidado que terá como centralidade ações de acolhimento, de autonomia e de vínculo entre usuários e trabalhadores da saúde.
