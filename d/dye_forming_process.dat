40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new incremental sheet metal <b>forming</b> <b>process.</b> By moving a hammering tool over a sheet metal fixed by a frame, a three-dimensional workpiece {{can be produced}} without using any special die plate. As the forces on the handling equipment are very low compared to other <b>forming</b> <b>processes,</b> a common industrial robot {{can be used to}} move the hammering tool. Thus sheet metal parts can be produced with cost-effective equipment. Mainly small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from this new technology.
