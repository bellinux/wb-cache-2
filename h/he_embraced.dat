5|$|Michel Ordener was {{a general}} of {{division}} and a commander in Napoleon's elite Imperial Guard. Of plebeian origins, he was born 2 September 1755 in L'Hôpital and enlisted as private {{at the age of}} 18 years in the Prince Conde's Legion. He was promoted through the ranks; as warrant officer of a regiment of Chasseurs à Cheval, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> the French Revolution in 1789. He advanced quickly through the officer ranks during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its leader Elijah Muhammad. Expressing many regrets about {{his time with}} them, which {{he had come to}} regard as largely wasted, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> Sunni Islam. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated the Nation of Islam, disavowed racism and founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. <b>He</b> <b>embraced</b> only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although he did not take it up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's staunchly Church of England {{mother and}} grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist {{influences}} {{and at his}} leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to Hull in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken {{to be separated from}} his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life, but as his religious fervour diminished, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> theatre-going, attended balls and played cards.|$|E

5|$|Born in Sydney, New South Wales to {{a middle-class}} family of English descent, Childe studied Classics at the University of Sydney {{before moving to}} England to study Classical {{archaeology}} at the University of Oxford. Here, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists {{to the detriment of}} Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Australian Labor Party as the private secretary of politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he authored an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture to the British archaeological community.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{was born}} in Portland, Maine on March 20, 1804, the son of Josiah Dow and his wife, Dorcas Allen Dow. Josiah Dow {{was a member of}} the Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers) and a farmer {{originally}} from New Hampshire. Dorcas Allen was also a Quaker, and a member of a prosperous Maine family headed by her prominent grandfather, Hate-Evil Hall. They had three children, of whom Neal was the middle child and only son. After his marriage, Dow's father opened a tannery in Portland, which soon became a successful business. After attending a Friends school in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and further schooling at Edward Payson's Portland Academy, Dow followed his father into the tanning trade in 1826. <b>He</b> <b>embraced</b> technology, becoming one of the first in the city to incorporate steam power in the tanning process.|$|E
5|$|Immersed in the university's violent gang culture, in 1947 he {{took part}} in a quashed attempt to {{overthrow}} the military junta of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Returning to student politics, Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police, at which he became increasingly left-wing in his views. Traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, he fought for the Liberals in the Bogotazo before returning to Havana, where <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> Marxism. In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart, and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born. Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950, he co-opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate. When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency, Castro brought legal challenges against him, but as this proved ineffective, he began to think of other ways to oust Batista.|$|E

5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where {{he spent most of}} his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 {{through to}} 1946 {{he worked as}} the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and then from 1947 to 1957 as {{director}} of the Institute of Archaeology, London. During this period he oversaw excavation of a number of archaeological sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, focusing in particular on the society of Neolithic Orkney by excavating the settlement of Skara Brae and the chambered tombs of Maeshowe and Quoyness. Throughout, he continued to publish prolifically, producing excavation reports, journal articles, and books. With Stuart Piggott and Grahame Clark he co-founded The Prehistoric Society in 1934, becoming its first president. Remaining committed to his socialist ideals, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> Marxism, and used Marxist ideas as an interpretative framework for archaeological data. He also became a noted sympathiser with the Soviet Union and visited the country on a number of occasions, although grew sceptical of Soviet foreign policy following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. His beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from entering the United States, despite being repeatedly invited to lecture there. Upon retirement, he returned to Australia's Blue Mountains, there committing suicide.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before {{becoming}} politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu tribal land affairs. During the 1930s he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938 he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. In 1946, he returned to Kenya and became a school principal. In 1947 he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support yet animosity from white settlers. In 1952, {{he was among the}} Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and then exiled in Lodwar until 1961.|$|E

5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Grove's Crystal Palace {{programme}} notes did not concentrate {{solely on}} his favourite Austro-German composers. <b>He</b> <b>embraced</b> a representative selection of composers, notably the Frenchmen Berlioz, Bizet, Delibes, Gounod, Massenet and Saint-Saëns, {{and the rising}} generations of British composers – Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Hamish MacCunn, Edward German and Granville Bantock.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his high}} school graduation, Flower wished to become a Protestant minister, like his father and an older brother before him.

25|$|Douglas {{faced an}} ugly dilemma. If he {{rejected}} Dred Scott, {{he would lose}} Southern support he needed for the presidential election of 1860. If <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> Dred Scott, he would lose northern support. He tried to avoid both hazards, issuing a tepid endorsement of the decision, while continuing to assert popular sovereignty without explicitly saying the Court was wrong.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> infinitesimals and worked {{long on the}} mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite multitude as he called it) of instants.|$|E
25|$|Yet, in {{the society}} of the U.S., the “real-life” {{redemption}} of the egghead intellectual was possible if <b>he</b> <b>embraced</b> the mores of mainstream society; thus, in the fiction of O. Henry, a character noted that once an East Coast university graduate “gets over” his intellectual vanity — he no longer thinks himself better than other men — he makes just as good a cowboy as any other young man, despite his common-man counterpart being the slow-witted naïf of good heart, a pop culture stereotype from stage shows.|$|E
