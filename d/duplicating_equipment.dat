25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people {{known to be}} {{supportive}} of the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a wanted person (although for cheque fraud only), the police were interested in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only <b>duplicating</b> <b>equipment</b> on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of gelignite, two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to wrap a bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E

40|$|To {{share the}} fixed {{cost of a}} {{communication}} network, the private-cost method allocates to each subscriber the cost of his dedicated terminal devices. The external-cost method shares the connecting cost of user i among all of his correspondents in proportion to their traffic with i. All convex combinations of these two methods are characterized by three axioms: additivity with respect to connecting costs, sustainability (it is not profitable for any subnetwork to <b>duplicate</b> <b>equipment</b> for inside traffic), and no transit (it is not profitable for any three users i, j, and k to make some of the traffic between i and j transit through k). ...|$|R

Some of BR's Mk1 coaches were built with dual brakes (all had vacuum as standard) and {{much of the rest of}} the fleet was dual fitted by the 1980s, so they could be worked by air or vacuum fitted locomotives as the changeover from vacuum to air took place between 1970 and the early 1990s.|$|R

40|$|The {{idea for}} this booklet {{came from the}} Lilly Endowment Incorporated 2 ̆ 7 s Faculty Development Conference in Indianapolis earlier this year. Before that conference, we each {{received}} a booklet which included the program schedule, a list of participants and single paragraph bios, and a one-page description of each program represented at the conference. I {{was fascinated by the}} diversity of 2 ̆ 2 faculty development 2 ̆ 2 programs, and by the varied backgrounds and interests of their staffs. We decided, therefore, to put together a similar booklet for participants in this POD Conference as a part of our 2 ̆ 2 Information Fair. 2 ̆ 2 This booklet includes all of the program descriptions (generally in the order received) which I received as of Tuesday, October 12, the names and addresses of participants, and the conference program. It does not include the single paragraph bios. My apologies to all of you who prepared and sent them in. When all of the <b>duplicating</b> <b>equipment</b> at the University of Rhode Island broke down, the expense of including that information became prohibitive. Fortunately, Steve Scholl was able to get most of the other material copied at Ohio Wesleyan. My apologies too, if I mislaid any of your program descriptions and left them out of the booklet. Otherwise, I hope you find the booklet interesting and helpful. I have enjoyed reading your materials...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis and its rippling {{effects on the}} wider corporate sector have prompted companies to rethink how they govern and manage risk. This paper discusses the board’s role in the governance of risk {{and the benefits of}} establishing a separate board-level risk-management committee—a need that applies to financial and nonfinancial institutions, as well as large and small companies. Foreword All business decisions involve risk. The challenge to boards and senior management is to balance risk with acceptable reward, to create value without hazarding the enterprise. This means understanding the corporate exposure to risk, determining how those risks are to be faced, and ensuring that they are handled appropriately. There are four possible responses to a business risk: 1. Avoid the risk. Abandon the proposed project. 2. Mitigate the risk. Make capital investments or incur ongoing expenditures—for example, by obtaining standby <b>equipment,</b> <b>duplicating</b> critical components, investing in staff training—plus establish risk policies, such as requiring top executives to travel separately in case of an accident. 3. Transfer the risk. Spread the exposure to other parties. Insure against the risk, although some risks may be uninsurable. Hedge the risk by negotiating long-term contracts. Create derivative instruments, agreements with financial institutions that transfer the risk to third parties...|$|R
40|$|NREL’s Process Engineering Team has {{developed}} a database of primary information {{on all of the}} equipment in the benchmark model. This database contains information about the cost, reference year, scaling factor, scaling characteristic, design information and back-up cost referencing. The information is stored in a secure database in the Biotechnology Center for Fuels and Chemicals and can be directly linked to the economic portion of the model. In addition to having all of the cost information used by the model, it has the ability to store documents pertaining to the piece of equipment. These include sizing and costing calculations and vendor information when available. The following summarizes the important fields of information contained in the database. A partial listing of the information is attached for each piece of equipment. Additional information from the database is contained in the equipment cost listing in Appendix B. Equipment Number:AB Unique identifier, the first letter indicates the equipment type and the first number represents the process area, e. g., P- 301 is a pump in Area 300 Equipment Name:AB Descriptive name of the piece of equipment Associated PFD: PFD number on which the piece of equipment appears, e. g., PFD-P 110 -A 101 Equipment Category:A Code indicating the general type of equipment, e. g., PUMP Equipment Type:A Code indicating the specific type of equipment, e. g., CENTRIFUGAL for a pump Equipment Description:A Short description of the size or characteristics of the piece of equipment, e. g., 20 gpm, 82 ft head for a pump Number Required:B Number of <b>duplicate</b> pieces of <b>equipment</b> needed Number Spares:B Number of on-line spares Scaling Stream:B Stream number or other characteristic variable from the ASPEN model by which the equipment cost will be scaled Base Cost:B Equipment cost Cost Basis:A Source of the equipment cost, e. g., ICARUS or VENDOR Cost Year:B Year for which the cost estimate is base...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Waist, hip, {{and neck}} {{circumference}} measurements are cost-effective, non-invasive, useful markers for body fat distribution and disease risk. For epidemiology and intervention studies, including body circumference measurements in self-report surveys could be informative. However, {{few studies have}} assessed the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of a self-report tool feasible for use in large scale studies. Methods At home, mothers of young children viewed a brief, online instructional video on how to measure their waist, hip, and neck circumferences. Afterwards, they created a homemade paper measuring tape from a downloaded file with scissors and tape, took all measurements in duplicate, and entered them into an online survey. A few weeks later, participants visited an anthropometrics lab where they measured themselves again, and trained technicians (n[*]=[*] 9) measured participants in <b>duplicate</b> using standard <b>equipment</b> and procedures. To assess differences between self- and technician-measured circumferences, duplicate measurements for participant home self-measurements, participant lab self-measurements, and technician measurements each were averaged and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests conducted. Agreement between all possible pairs of measurements were examined using Intraclass Correlations (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Participants (n[*]=[*] 41; aged 38. 05 [*]±[*] 3. 54 SD years; 71  % white) were all mothers that {{had at least one}} child under the age of 12  yrs. Technical error of measurements for self- and technician- duplicate measurements varied little (0. 08 to 0. 76 inches) and had very high reliability (≥ 0. 90). Intraclass Correlations (ICC) comparing self vs technician were high (0. 97, 0. 96, and 0. 84 for waist, hip, and neck). Comparison of self-measurements at home vs lab revealed high test-retest reliability (ICC[*]≥[*] 0. 87). Differences between participant self- and technician measurements were small (i. e., mean difference ranged from − 0. 13 to 0. 06 inches) with nearly all (≥ 93  %) differences within Bland-Altman limits of agreement and < 10  % exceeding the a priori clinically meaningful difference criterion. Conclusions This study has demonstrated a simple, inexpensive method for teaching novice mothers of young children to take their own body circumferences resulting in accurate, reliable data. Thus, collecting self-measured and self-reported circumference data in future studies may be a feasible approach in research protocols that has potential to expand our knowledge of body composition beyond that provided by self-reported body mass indexes...|$|R
