Hormonal fluctuation during lactation exerts a strong influence, inducing neuroplasticity in the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic regions, and diminishing {{the stress and}} inflammatory responses. Thus, hormones confer decreased vulnerability to the female brain. This mini-review focuses on the adaptations of the immune and stress response during maternity, and on the neuroprotective actions of progesterone and prolactin and their effects on inflammation.

They include wider contexts, from the replacement of obsolete middle tiers, to the migration of algorithms from prototype-purpose platforms to commercial platforms. As the need of modernization continues to increase, we need to understand better what are the challenges to be addressed in relation to modern practices and processes.

This paper presents a synopsis of challenges encountered during several modernization and mi gration initiatives within different industrial domains, across organizations spanning diverse countries.

40|$|In {{line with}} the frontal {{hypothesis}} of aging, the ability to plan ahead undergoes substantial change during normal aging. Although impairments on the Tower of London planning task were reported earlier, associations between age-related declines and specific cognitive demands on planning have not been studied. Here we investigated the impact of search depth and goal ambiguity on planning, which <b>impose</b> <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> the depth and breadth of look-ahead processes, respectively. Besides an overall age-related decline in planning accuracy of 106 healthy older adults, differential search depth effects were found: Whereas planning accuracy of subjects in the early 60 s was not affected by variations in search depth, {{between the ages of}} 65 and 76 years, accuracy was significantly decreased for high versus low levels of search depth. For subjects older than 76, different search depth levels did not further impact on accuracy, which was lowest overall. This nonlinear pattern may reflect differential impairments in fluid abilities and working memory capacity across various stages of older age. As no age-related effects of goal ambiguity were found, normal aging seems to be specifically sensitive to planning demands on the depth but not the breadth of anticipatory search processes. Hence, cognitive functions subserved by the prefrontal cortex experience differential development over the course of normal aging...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{combining}} continuous free recall with a concurrent task {{have generally}} shown that concurrent tasks impose fairly negligible effects on memory retrieval. By contrast, dual-task studies employing either cued recall or semantic retrieval reveal gross memory impairment {{and suggest that}} retrieval is delayed by the centrally demanding phase of the concurrent tasks (i. e., response selection). To explore this conflict, subjects performed continuous free recall while carrying out a serial-choice– response time (RT) task, {{as in the previous}} free recall studies. Unlike these previous studies, however, the choice–RT task utilized arbitrary stimulus–response mappings in order to increase the proportion of time devoted to the centrally demanding response selection phase. Recall total was reduced significantly, and recall latency was slowed substantially. People sometimes remark that it is subjectively taxing to retrieve information from memory, especially when such retrieval is not immediately successful. For example, it is tiring to search in vain for a forgotten name, and likewise, laboratory subjects complain of fatigue when asked to devote several minutes to the recall of a previously studied list of words. Intuitively, therefore, one might suppose that memory retrieval must <b>impose</b> <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> limited cognitive resources or mechanisms.

40|$|In Legal Ethics and Moral Character, 23 GEO. J. LEGAL Ethics, Alice Woolley and W. Bradley Wendel {{argue that}} {{theories}} of legal ethics may be evaluated {{by examining the}} kind of person a lawyer must be to conform to the normative demands of the theory. In their words, theories of legal ethics musts answer questions not only of what a lawyer must do, but how a lawyer must be. Woolley and Wendel examine three theories of legal ethics—those of Charles Fried, William Simon, and myself—and conclude that the theories they discuss <b>impose</b> <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> agency that are not realistic, functional, or desirable. On behalf of Simon’s theory and my own—both of which are “high commitment” accounts of legal ethics—I respond to all three criticisms. Neither theory is unrealistic in the sense of requiring impossible things of lawyers. If the charge of unrealism means only that the theory sometimes requires lawyers to take difficult or uncomfortable stances, I argue that this counts as a legitimate criticism only if the theory’s prescriptions are doubtful on independent moral grounds. To the criticism that high-commitment ethical theories are not functional, I observe that Woolley and Wendel identify functionality with fitting comfortably into law firm culture. In response, I suggest that if ethical conduct places a lawyer at odds with law firm culture that should count as a criticism of the law firm rather than the lawyer’s theory of ethics; in any case, Woolley and Wendel have wrongly presupposed that the high-commitment lawyer is working in a setting of low-commitment lawyers rather than other high commitment lawyers. Finally, I argue that Woolley and Wendel are incorrect to believe that the character traits required for high-commitment legal practice are undesirable because they would lead lawyers to buck the system when they should not do so...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and problem}} discussion: The Swedish {{accounting}} framework {{is currently in}} a transition stage. The Swedish Accounting Standards Board has since 2004 {{been working on a}} project that aims to reform the standard setting for what is generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden. The purpose is to simplify the regulatory requirements and to develop an overall framework for four categories of companies. The so-called K 3 framework, which will become the main framework replacing the current standard setting within a few years, is under construction and is essentially based on IFRS for SME. This main framework will be less detailed and contain fewer examples than today's framework and may therefore include some adjustments for the accounting profession in Sweden. This study will investigate how the transition to the K 3 framework and the change that this means, will affect those working with accounting in Sweden. Aim of the thesis: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify possible effects on the accounting profession with the introduction of the K 3 framework. The study will be performed by investigating the expectations on what a shift from a more detailed framework to a regulatory framework that is more driven by the prevailing principles means to the accounting profession and the existing accounting culture within the profession. Method: The empirical data is gathered through personal interviews with knowledgeable persons within the accounting profession in Sweden. The interviews were conducted with three different groups; experts, accounting experts and accountants, in order to get a broader view of the problem area. Conclusion: The study indicates that the transition to the K 3 framework will mean that the accounting profession must make more judgments and adapt a new way of thinking. It has also emerged that not only the transition to the K 3 framework will <b>impose</b> <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> the profession but also the change by itself; change is always difficult and requires an effort. The transition by itself will also require some education for the practitioners to learn the framework. Proposals for future studies: During the study several areas for future studies has been identified; what the implementation will actually mean, what the K 3 framework will provide for the accounting and the outcome of the financial statements, and if the company's method of reporting will distinguish itself more with the introduction of the K 3 framework since the framework is more flexible than the current regulations. In addition, it would be interesting to investigate how the accounting profession will be affected by the fact that Sweden will have both regulatory frameworks based on principles and based on rules...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} and questions surrounding {{the design of}} a competition system are part of an identifiable life cycle that characterizes the development of a competition agency. The core challenges are to set priorities and execute them, but there are various potential obstacles. This article looks at the FTC’s experiences in its first decade, a period bringing extraordinary technological dynamism that reshaped the U. S. economy and transitions in political leadership, to shed light on how a new or reformed agency might go about facing predictable problems in its first years and to suggest how these agencies can improve their effectiveness. New institutions like the FTC are shaped by the socio-political context that leads to their formation. Interested parties had multiple conceptions about the FTC’s purpose and differing expectations as to its use when the FTC was formed. Law enabling competition systems generally embodies a mix of objectives and policy aims that the new agency must reconcile. Some of the most daunting tasks for the leadership of these institutions is to identify the multiple policy impulses that brought the agency to life; to assess the relative intensity and importance of individual ideas; and to formulate a program that is coherent, faithful to its original aims, and adaptable to political and intellectual changes. External stakeholders who <b>impose</b> <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> new agencies and political transitions complicate these tasks. The FTC was in some ways poorly organized {{to meet the challenges of}} its first decade due to its lack of centralized leadership and small staff. However, it still addressed tough issues in the emerging economies of the 1920 s, in part by establishing many of its critical elements. First, the development of an administrative adjudication process helped make the FTC an influential competition policy tribunal. Also, the completion of studies examining competitive conditions in one or more industries was part of the FTC’s broad program to address competitive problems and led to FTC litigation, referrals to the Department of Justice, and legislative proposals. A final element was outreach through the introduction of “trade practice submittal,” which permitted the FTC to meet representatives of industries and formulate rules that formally expressed judgment on the industry. In part because it was stretched too thin by its inability to set priorities and it faced a hostile judiciary, the FTC often failed to implement its plans for a successful enforcement program. Its problems were compounded by inadequate articulation of the rationales for its early orders and for its decision not to prosecute. The FTC’s challenges in setting priorities and executing its goals in the face of early challenges may serve as a cautionary lesson for other new agencies...|$|E
