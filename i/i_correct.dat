Before the performance she said; [...] "I believe 30 years ago you fought for your freedom, am <b>I</b> <b>correct?</b> It's called People Power Freedom , did I say that right? Up with democracy and freedom! That is the revolution of love. And that's what a rebel heart fights for. So on this very special occasion, I want to sing this song".|$|E

60|$|Psha! The 'bidding him God speed',--[Greek: légôn autô chaírein],--(2 'John', 11,) is a spirituality, not a mere civility. If St. John knew or {{suspected}} that Cerinthus had a cutaneous disease, {{there would have}} been some sense in the refusal, or rather, as <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> myself, some probability of truth in this gossip of Irenaeus.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} {{computer}} predicting whom the electorate would vote for instead of actually holding an election was probably inspired by the UNIVAC <b>I's</b> <b>correct</b> prediction of {{the result of the}} U.S. presidential election in 1952.|$|R
60|$|February 3.--I {{corrected}} proofs {{and wrote}} this morning,--but slowly, heavily, lazily. There was a mist {{on my mind}} which my exertions could not dispel. I did not get two pages finished, but <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> proofs and commentated.|$|R
5000|$|... it {{was used}} in The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, [...] "All flesh is weak. All flesh is grass, <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> her in my head," [...] (45). The name of the butcher's shop [...] "All Flesh" [...] is also a {{reference}} to this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I see {{no reason}} why I should not find Nimmie Amee. We are now in the Munchkin Country, where we are {{perfectly}} safe, and if it was right for me, before our enchantment, to marry Nimmie Amee and make her Empress of the Winkies, it must be right now, when the enchantment has been broken and I am once more myself. Am <b>I</b> <b>correct,</b> friend Scarecrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very curious}} {{to learn how}} you became aware of this oar, of the {{existence}} of which we of the museum were ignorant. Am <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in assuming that you have read an account in some diary published later by this Daniel Foss? I shall be glad for any information on the subject, and am proceeding at once to have the oar and the pamphlet put back on exhibition.|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet at one {{period in}} the proceedings, Comrade Brady," [...] said Psmith, [...] "I fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck. But the fear was merely transient. When you began to {{administer}} those--am <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in saying?--half-scissor hooks to the body, why, then I felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken; or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes {{he stared at the}} Pacific." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A long talker," [...] <b>I</b> <b>corrected.</b> [...] "My cousin {{mentioned}} him {{third in}} her list of invitations. 'Longrush,' {{she said with}} conviction, 'we must have Longrush.' 'Isn't he rather tiresome?' I suggested. 'He is tiresome,' she agreed, 'but then he's so useful. He never lets the conversation drop.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I run {{in after}} I {{come out of}} school for half an hour. Last Saturday <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> a sheet of the Pursuivant, because Mr. Froggatt had to go out, and that made it more. And, Father, Mr. Froggatt says that poor old Smith will never be fit for work again.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{can best}} show Fleeming in this later stage by quoting from a vivid and {{interesting}} letter of M. Emile Trelat's. Here, admirably expressed, {{is how he}} appeared {{to a friend of}} another nation, whom he encountered only late in life. M. Trelat will pardon me if <b>I</b> <b>correct,</b> even before I quote him; but what the Frenchman supposed to flow from some particular bitterness against France, was only Fleeming's usual address. Had M. Trelat been Italian, Italy would have fared as ill; and yet Italy was Fleeming's favourite country.|$|E
6000|$|Hunting further, I find again my Savoy lily {{called a}} spider-plant, under the article Hemerocallis, {{and the only}} {{information}} which the book gives me under Hemerocallis, is that it means 'beautiful day' lily; and then, [...] "This is an ornamental genus of the easiest culture. The species are remarkable among border flowers for their fine orange, yellow, or blue flowers. The Hemerocallis coerulea has been considered a distinct genus by Mr. Salisbury, and called Saussurea." [...] As <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> this sheet for press, however, I find that the Hemerocallis is now to be called 'Funkia,' [...] "in honour of Mr. Funk, a Prussian apothecary." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS P.--How those {{children}} are spoilt! Goodness; what can I do? If <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> one, he flies to grandmamma Kicklebury; if I speak to another, she appeals to grandmamma Bonnington. When I {{was alone with}} them, I had them in something like order. Now, between the one grandmother and the other, the {{children are going to}} ruin, and so would the house too, but that Howell--that odd, rude, but honest and intelligent creature, I must say--keeps it up. It is wonderful how a person in his rank of life should have instructed himself so. He really knows--I really think he knows more than I do myself.|$|E

60|$|June 10.--This was {{an unusual}} teind-day at Court. In the morning and evening <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> proofs--four sheets in number; and I wrote my task of three pages and a little more. Three pages a day will come, at Constable's rate, to about £12,000 to £15,000 per year. They have sent their claim; it does not frighten me a bit.|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak," [...] he said, [...] "what nine-tenths of your countrymen believe. Yet you are wrong. Wherever {{there are}} {{international}} questions which bring great powers such as yours into antagonism, or the reverse, with other great countries, {{the soil is}} laid ready for intrigue, and the seed is never long wanted. Yes; I know that, to all appearance, you are the smuggest and most respectable nation ever evolved in this world's history. Yet {{if you tell me}} that your's is a nation free from intrigue, <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> you; you are wrong, you do not know--that is all! That very man, whose life last night you so inopportunely saved, is at this moment deeply involved in an intrigue against your country." ...|$|E

I told him {{over and over again that}} you are not that sort; but nothing can persuade him. Of course, mother, he doesn't talk good grammar, and he uses some queer expressions; but he is very much changed in that way since I first knew him, and he tries very hard, and don't mind a bit how often <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> him, and he is beginning to read easy words quite well; and he is one of the best-hearted fellows in the world." ...|$|E
60|$|Even while <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> these sheets for press, {{a lecture}} by Professor Tyndall {{has been put}} into my hands, which I ought to have heard last 16th January, but was {{hindered}} by mischance; and which, I now find, completes, in two important particulars, the evidence of an instinctive truth in ancient symbolism; showing, first, that the Greek conception of an ætherial element pervading space is justified by the closest reasoning of modern physicists; and, secondly, that {{the blue of the}} sky, hitherto thought to be caused by watery vapour, is, indeed, reflected from the divided air itself; so that the bright blue of the eyes of Athena, and the deep blue of her ægis, prove to be accurate mythic expressions of natural phenomena which it is an uttermost triumph of recent science to have revealed.|$|E

60|$|May 5.--Haunted by gloomy thoughts; but <b>I</b> <b>corrected</b> proofs {{from seven}} to ten, and wrote from half-past ten to one.

6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> {{this chapter}} for press, I find {{it is too}} {{imperfect}} to be let go without {{a word or two}} more. In the first place, I have not enough, in distinguishing the nature of the living yearly shoot, with its cluster of fresh leafage, from that of the accumulated mass of perennial trees, taken notice of the similar power even of the annual shoot, to obtain some manner of immortality for itself, or at least of usefulness, after death. A Tuscan woman stopped me on the path up to Fiesole last night, to beg me to buy her plaited straw. I wonder how long straw lasts, if one takes care of it? A Leghorn bonnet, (if now such things are,) carefully put away,--even properly taken care of when it is worn,--how long will it last, young ladies? ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{just when}} he was saying this {{there was a knock}} at the door and Mrs. O'Halloran came in. I knew at once what she had come for, because she had been {{threatening}} to do it, and so I felt dreadfully nervous when she began to say that our bill at the house had gone unpaid too long and that we must pay her at once what we owed her. It took some time before Uncle William understood what she was talking about, but when he did he became dreadfully frigid and polite. He said, [...] "Let me understand clearly, madame, just what it is that you wish to say: do I apprehend that you are saying that my account here for our maintenance is now due and payable?" [...] Mrs. O'Halloran said yes, she was. And Uncle said, [...] "Let me endeavour to grasp your meaning exactly: am <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> in thinking that you mean I owe you money?" [...] Mrs. O'Halloran said that was what she meant. Uncle said, [...] "Let me try to apprehend just as accurately as possible what it is that you are trying to tell me: is my surmise correct that you are implying that it is time that I settled up my bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I find (A) {{the number}} of {{children}} of equal numbers of urban and of rural mothers. The census schedules contain returns of the names and ages of the members of each [...] "family," [...] by which word we are to understand those members who are alive and resident in the same house with their parents. When the mothers are young, the children are necessarily very young, and nearly always (in at least those classes who are unable {{to send their children to}} boarding schools) live at home. If, therefore, we limit our inquiries to the census [...] "families" [...] of young mothers, the results may be accepted as practically identical with those we should have obtained if we had direct means of ascertaining {{the number of}} their living children. The limits of age of the mothers which I adopted in my selection were, 24 and 40 years. Had I to begin the work afresh, I should prefer the period from 20 to 35, but I have reason to feel pretty well contented with my present data. <b>I</b> <b>correct</b> the results thus far obtained on the following grounds:--(B) the relative mortality of the two classes between childhood and maturity; (C) the relative mortality of the rural and urban mothers during childbearing ages; (D) their relative celibacy; and (E) the span of a rural and urban generation. It will be shown that B is important, and C noteworthy, but that D and E may be disregarded.|$|E
