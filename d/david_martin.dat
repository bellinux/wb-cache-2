5|$|No American {{official}} casualty {{return from}} December 5 to 8 {{is known to}} exist. Some information, however, can be pieced together from various sources. For December 5, <b>David</b> <b>Martin</b> says that General Irvine's force took about 40 casualties, while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men. For December 6, Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed, 40 wounded and 15 captured. The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John André in his journal.|$|E
5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, <b>David</b> <b>Martin</b> says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 killed or wounded and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E

25|$|Realizing that Gaeta {{could not}} be cheaply taken, the French {{appointed}} General of Brigade Jacques <b>David</b> <b>Martin</b> de Campredon, an engineering expert, to direct the siege. In order to {{get close enough to}} blast a breach in the walls, the French began digging parallels into {{the ground in front of}} Monte Sacco. Because the soil was rocky, this process was difficult. Meanwhile, Hesse was loath to mount sorties to destroy the French siege lines because the Neapolitan soldiers would frequently desert to the French. Hesse requested assistance from his government, but did not receive any right away because Admiral Sidney Smith was fully employed in supporting the guerilla war in Calabria. At length, Smith's squadron arrived at Gaeta and dropped off food, four heavy cannons, and the partisan leader Michele Pezza, also known as Fra Diavolo. Smith also ordered some gunboats under Captain Richardson to stand by the fortress, a reinforcement which proved troublesome to the enemy. Sometime in April, the Royal Navy landed Fra Diavolo and considerable force of irregulars near the mouth of the Garigliano. Their raid was successful at first but the partisans were finally scattered and Fra Diavolo made his way back to Gaeta. When Fra Diavolo was later implicated in a scheme to betray Gaeta, Hesse had him shipped back to Palermo in chains.|$|E
25|$|The Realist Writers Group was a {{collective}} of writers, usually communists but also composed of left wing supporters and established in Australia in 1944. The first collective began in Melbourne {{and the movement}} spread to Brisbane in 1950, then to Sydney in 1952, Perth in 1960 and Newcastle in 1963. In 1960 a National Council of Groups was established to internationally link the branches with groups in New Zealand, Canada, the USA and countries under communist rule. The Realist Writers intentions were defined by their constitution as 'literary organizations {{of the working class}} movement... to carry forward the revolutionary and democratic traditions of Australian literature'. The first published journal came from the Melbourne branch titled Realist Writer and appeared quarterly from March 1952 to April 1954 when it was incorporated into Overland. The first two issues were edited by Bill Wannan and by Stephen Murray-Smith for the next seven. Noteworthy contributors included <b>David</b> <b>Martin,</b> Frank Hardy, Laurence Collinson, John Manifold, John Morrison, Eric Lambert and Katharine Susannah Prichard. A version of the Realist Writer appeared from the Sydney branch in renewed form in 1958 edited by Frank Hardy and from 1960 appeared three times a year until the groups began to disintegrate in the 1970s. When the National Council of Groups was formed in 1960 the Realist Writer came under its responsibility. In 1964 the name was changed to The Realist! and from 1962-70 was edited by Ray Williams. Its contributors included Len Fox, Wilma Hedley and Ron Tullipan.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the race on the morning of Friday, 10April , the old priest of Marathon, Ioannis Veliotis, was {{scheduled}} to say a prayer for the athletes in the church of Saint John. Veliotis refused to bless Revithi because she was not an officially recognized athlete. The organizing committee ultimately refused her entry into the race.

500|$|Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One {{column in}} The West Australia found humour in them, {{referring}} to the head as a [...] "bonce" [...] and a [...] "noggin", and finished with a pun on [...] "skullduggery". Stephen Muecke calls this the [...] "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns"; and Adam Shoemaker writes [...] "This {{is the stuff of}} light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less {{that it could have been}} motivated by malevolence... he piece has a definite authorising function". On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, <b>David</b> <b>Martin</b> described the decapitation as [...] "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own." ...|$|E
