40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>drilling</b> <b>fixture</b> that fits on the EMCO MILL 55 CNC working table for machining the holes of some blanks made of materials having low and average hardness. The modeling {{was carried out}} with Autodesk Inventor software package, highlighting the essential controls, from basic sketches to {{the completion of the}} component parts, respectively the final assembly. At the same time, the paper {{presents a}} brief theoretical calculation of the necessary force for fixing the blank into the fixture. Based on the fixture elements, the physical model of the drilling device was drawn. Moreover, a double- straight edged helical drill used for the drilling process was modeled in CATIA environment...|$|E
50|$|Two common {{elements}} of <b>drilling</b> <b>fixtures</b> are {{the hole and}} bushing. Holes are often designed into <b>drilling</b> <b>fixtures,</b> to allow space for the drill bit itself to continue through the workpiece without damaging the <b>fixture</b> or <b>drill,</b> or to guide the drill bit to the appropriate point on the workpiece. Bushings are simple bearing sleeves inserted into these holes to protect them and guide the drill bit.|$|R
50|$|Because drills tend {{to apply}} force {{in only one}} direction, support {{components}} for <b>drilling</b> <b>fixtures</b> may be simpler. If the drill is aligned pointing down, the same support components may compensate for the forces of both the drill and gravity at once. However, though monodirectional, the force applied by drills tends to be concentrated on a very small area. <b>Drilling</b> <b>fixtures</b> must be designed carefully to prevent the workpiece from bending under {{the force of the}} drill.|$|R
50|$|Fixtures {{are usually}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} machine {{for which they were}} designed. The most common two are milling <b>fixtures</b> and <b>drill</b> <b>fixtures.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>fixtures</b> cover a {{wider range}} of {{different}} designs and procedures than milling fixtures. Though workholding for drills is more often provided by jigs, fixtures are also used for drilling operations.|$|R
40|$|Occupational noise {{caused by}} the rock drills used in mining was {{investigated}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines. Using a large reverberation chamber and an automated <b>drill</b> test <b>fixture</b> (ADTF), the sound power levels of mining drills were measured {{to determine if there}} are types of drills that are advantageous from a noise production standpoint. Test results show that while there are not large variations among types of drills, there are still some choices that could produce a positive effect on overall noise exposure. It is also shown that lower noise exposures are possible using larger drills because of higher production rates and better operator positioning...|$|R
40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} {{in detail the}} design and operation of a test apparatus for measuring the sound power levels of drills used by the mining industry. The two major components of the test apparatus are a computer-controlled automated <b>drill</b> test <b>fixture</b> (ADTF) and a large (45, 000 -ft 3) reverberation chamber that houses the ADTF. Design specifications and performance capabilities of the ADTF and the reverberation room are given. Initial test results for three types of drills [...] a pneumatic percussion drill, a hydraulic percussion drill, and a pneumatic rotary drill [...] are given to illustrate the types of experiments that can be conducted with the test appartus...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The bone {{particles}} harvested during osteotomy {{could be}} used as autogenous bone graft materials to correct a bony defect prior to implant placement. Methods: A simple surgical procedure was described in which autogenous bone was harvested from the drills during the preparation of implant sites. Eleven samples were obtained from bone <b>drilling</b> during <b>fixture</b> installation in 11 patients (5 men and 6 women) with an average age of 57 years. These samples were subjected to histological preparation, in order to evaluate for the presence of viable osteoblasts. Results: Histological evaluation of the samples suggested that the viability of the bone tissue was maintained. Conclusion: The results show that this method of harvesting autogenous bone may be useful in situations where small amounts of bone are required...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{was evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to predict and recognize failure of cutting tools during machining processes when the cutting tool rotates and the workpiece is stationary. AE output was evaluated with a simple algorithm. AE was able to detect drill failure when the transducer was mounted on the workpiece holding <b>fixture.</b> <b>Drill</b> failure was recognized as size was reduced to 0. 0003 in. diameter. The ability to predict failure was reduced with drill size, drill material elasticity, and tool coating. AE output for the turning process on a lathe was compared to turning tool insert wear. The turning tool must have sufficient wear to produce a detectable change in AE output to predict insert failure...|$|R
50|$|Now {{halfway through}} production, the helmet {{is left to}} dry for several minutes. Once it is dry, black plastic piping is sewn around the brim of the helmet to {{reinforce}} it {{and give it a}} neater edge. For rosetop and ball helmet styles, the metal fastening prongs or screws of the chrome fixtures are dipped in chalk to mark their positions on the crown of the helmet; holes are then <b>drilled</b> and the <b>fixture</b> is secured. For comb-style helmets, the crest, which has vent holes incorporated into the design, is also fixed by prongs or simply glued into place at the top end of the comb. For all helmet styles, two vent holes are punched {{on both sides of the}} helmet and fitted with black metal grommets, making a total of four vent holes.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{autogenous}} bone grafts {{is considered}} to be the best choice for reconstructive surgery. In the periodontal literature, the utilization of osseous coagulum was suggested {{by the end of the}} sixties. The purpose of this study is to consider the use of bone collectors (bone traps) as an alternative method for obtaining material to fill small bone imperfections, such as fenestrations and dehiscences. Thirty samples were obtained from bone <b>drilling</b> during <b>fixture</b> installation in patients (13 men and 17 women, with an average age of 54 years) requiring treatment at the Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, University of Santo Amaro. These samples were fixed in 10 % neutral formaldehyde for 24 hours and subjected to histological preparation, in order to evaluate the presence of viable osteoblasts. In addition, the material was placed in a fluid thioglycolate medium and incubated for 24 hours at 36 ± 1 °C in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis. Bacterial growth evaluation was made by using six different culture media (MacConkey agar, blood agar base, mannitol salt agar, Anaerokit LTD medium, Anaerokit LTD - bile medium, Anaerinsol). The results show that, if proper care is taken to prevent saliva contamination during the surgical procedure, this method of collecting autogenous bone may be useful in situations where small amounts of bone are required...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} the mass {{production}} {{is to increase the}} productivity and increase the accuracy. This is done by reducing the set up cost and manual fatigue. Thus mass production can be achieved by the use of jigs. For large scale production of different materials a lot of time is wasted in set up of the device and clamping the device. Trial and error method is usually practiced until the axis of the hole is properly aligned with the axis of the drill. In such a situation a lot of time is being wasted to maintain the accuracy. Eventually it increases the operator’s fatigue. Thus drill jig increases productivity by eliminating individual positioning, marking and frequent checking. The main advantage of the jigs is interchangeability. A fixture is a production tool. The main aim is to locate, hold and support the work securely so that the required machining operations can be performed. Set blocks and feeler or thickness gauges are also used to provide reference of the cutter with the workpiece. A fixture must be easily fastened with the table and the machine. As a result the work can be done. Fixture is largely used in milling machines. But it can also be used for other operations on most of the standard machining tools like <b>drilling</b> machine. <b>Fixtures</b> are available in different shape and sizes ranging from simple and cheap devices to very expensive and complicated devices. Fixtures can also help to simplify the metalworking operations which are performed on the special equipment. Considering the advantages of jigs and fixtures, a fixture was designed to cater to our needs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{designing}} and manufacturing {{of a new}} bus is a process which need {{of a large number}} of technical labors and a great consumption time, starting from designing operation until full production process. Bus Industry in the Arab region realized some success and is equivalent to their counterparts in Europe and America. This makes the interest in reducing the time and efforts spent in the design, planning and production processes in the bus industry is an added value. The bus steel structure (skeleton) building process is the starting base for all the following manufacturing processes. Planning Department-based on it – start writing the operating pages and determine the required raw materials for the bus manufacture. The logistic department starts to provide the necessary raw materials for the bus construction. Tool department starts to design and manufacture of production facilities, and main <b>fixtures</b> (<b>drilling</b> and welding) for constructing the bus skeleton. The administration department collects all the information’s to estimate the bus cost and expect the profit from the implementation of this product. The virtual world created by the computer in nowadays our life puts a strong chance to simulate many of the manufacturing processes before they occur, and this was not available before. Bus skeleton design, planning and manufacturing operation represent a good example can be implemented entirely by using computer simulations.
