25|$|Modern {{commercial}} domino {{sets are}} usually made of synthetic materials, such as ABS or polystyrene plastics, or Bakelite and other phenolic resins; many sets approximate {{the look and}} feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different <b>end</b> <b>value</b> (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, even though two-sided pricing {{strategies}} generally increase total platform profits compared to traditional one-sided strategies, the actual <b>end</b> <b>value</b> of the two-sided pricing strategy is contingent on market characteristics {{and may not}} offset the costs of implementation. For example, profits of an application provider increase {{with the implementation of}} a two-sided pricing strategy of the platform provider only if the application is subsidized by the provider. Platform providers should also be more cautious when the giveaway product has appreciable unit costs, as with tangible goods. Free-PC incurred $80M in losses in 1999 when it decided to give away computers and Internet access at no cost to consumers who agreed to view Internet-delivered ads that could not be minimized or hidden. Unfortunately, willingness to pay does not materialize on the money side, as few marketers were eager to target consumers who were so cost conscious.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} total dietary fat {{on the blood}} lipid profile: a review Fat {{consumption}} has increased in Sweden in the 21 th century, {{probably due to the}} advancement of the diet low car high fat (LCHF). Also, cardiovascular disease {{is the leading cause of}} premature death in Sweden. Various blood lipids are used to evaluate the cardiovascular disease risk; total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides among others. High levels of total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and low levels of HDL are believed to increase the risk. The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of high-fat-diet on blood lipids, cholesterol, LDL, HDL the ratio between LDL/HDL and triglycerides through a systematic review. A supplementary purpose was to analyze the consequences on the cardiovascular health. Articles were systematically searched for and resulted in 23 articles which studied a fat-intake over 50 E%. Eight of these articles were included in the result since the 50 E% fat-intake was followed throughout the study. Four of the eight articles calculated statistical significance between baseline and <b>end</b> <b>values.</b> These studies found a statistical significance reduction in triglycerides and tendencies to a statistical significance increase in HDL after six months on a high fat diet. According to <b>end</b> <b>values,</b> six out of seven studies showed levels of total cholesterol above the risk level for cardiovascular disease and seven out of eight studies resulted in LDL-levels above cardiovascular risk. The articles which reported statistical significance were alike according to time of intervention, mean BMI and fat intake and therefore they should not have affected the results. The results from <b>end</b> <b>values</b> in the eight studies suggest that total cholesterol and LDL increase the cardiovascular risk but HDL, ratio LDL/HDL and triglycerides decrease the cardiovascular risk. The studies who reported statistical significance between baseline and <b>end</b> <b>values</b> did not present any risk for cardiovascular disease after six month on a high fat diet...|$|R

50|$|Escrow columns can be {{modified}} via an EscrowUpdate operation. Escrowed updates are numeric delta operations. Escrow columns must be of type Long. Examples of numeric delta operations include adding 2 to a value or subtracting 1 from a value. ESE tracks the change in a value rather than the <b>end</b> <b>value</b> of an update. Multiple sessions may each have outstanding changes made via EscrowUpdate to the same value because ESE can determine the actual <b>end</b> <b>value</b> regardless of which transactions commit and which transactions rollback. This allows multiple users to concurrently update a column by making numeric delta changes. Optionally, database engine can erase records with zero value of the column. A common use for such escrow column is reference counter: many threads increment/decrement the value without locks, and when the counter reaches zero, the record automatically gets deleted.|$|E

40|$|This paper employs {{numerical}} simulations {{to compare}} the relative performance of linear contracts with piecewise-linear-threshold contracts in the case where the agent chooses actions over time. These contracts are restricted to be functions of the <b>ending</b> <b>value</b> of aggregate output. We find strong evidence that only linear contracts need be considered in comparison with piecewise-linear-threshold contracts in the situation where cumulative output is only updated periodically and the agent's utility function is exponential. This finding holds even when {{there are only two}} periods and hence one change of action by the agent. However, we find that the best piecewise-linear-threshold contract is significantly superior to the best linear contract when the agent has a power utility function. These numerical simulations also call into question the use of a cap when the agent's compensation is based on the <b>ending</b> <b>value</b> of aggregate output and the agent's effort takes place over time. linear contracts, intertemporal incentives, dynamic programming, salesforce compensation...|$|R
