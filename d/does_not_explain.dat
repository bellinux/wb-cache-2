5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} low {{temperature}} superconductivity {{has been well}} understood since the BCS theory of 1957. It {{is based on a}} peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> {{the fact that}} they remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

Existing text planning techniques are not appropriate tbr this task for two main reasons: they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how arguments can be linked together in a linear presentation order and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how the rhetorical function of a proposition affects its wording...|$|R

5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain.</b> Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{heard that}} the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from Samos towards the Ionian mainland. According to Herodotus, this was because they had decided in council {{that they could not}} beat the Allies in a naval battle. They sent the Phoenician ships away (Herodotus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> why), and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale. Xerxes had left an army there, under the command of Tigranes, to guard Ionia. The Persians beached their ships, built a {{palisade}} around them, and prepared to guard the makeshift fort.|$|E

50|$|None {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} {{have ever been}} fully accepted: the regressive hypothesis <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> why even the smallest of cellular parasites <b>do</b> <b>not</b> resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis was quickly dismissed because it contravened the definition of viruses, in that they require host cells. Virologists are, however, beginning to reconsider and re-evaluate all three hypotheses.|$|R
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how multiple weak stimuli {{can result in}} a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the Moon's formation 4.51 billion years ago, and some 60 million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System. These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force (which would require too great an initial spin of Earth), the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon (which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon), and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk (which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> the depletion of metals in the Moon). These hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> {{why he was}} killed. In North West England, {{there is little evidence}} for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|E

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after all}} seven books had been published, Graeme Davis {{regarded}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and {{agreed that the}} plot structure {{is much the same}} as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside. The novel <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> Krycek's demands.|$|E

The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|R
