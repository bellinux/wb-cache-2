5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and <b>forward</b> <b>planning</b> in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{appeared to}} endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2billion), but did so largely for political reasons. This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, {{and a lack of}} standardisation. At the same time containerised freight was being developed. The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective <b>forward</b> <b>planning</b> or realistic assessments of future freight.|$|E

Magdhaba was about [...] from the British railhead and [...] from El Arish. There were two other important pieces of information von Kressenstein did not have. Firstly, he would have been unaware of the speed, flexibility and determination of the Australian, British and New Zealand mounted force, which they were about to demonstrate. Secondly, the arrival of the new British commander, Chetwode, and his staff and their vital <b>forward</b> <b>planning</b> to organise the necessary logistical support for an immediate long range attack by the Anzac Mounted Division.|$|E

500|$|As it was {{the first}} {{significant}} amphibious operation mounted by Australian forces since Gallipoli, extensive planning was put into the capture of Lae. Indeed, {{it was the}} first major operation for which the Australian Army was able to conduct long term <b>forward</b> <b>planning,</b> with deliberate planning beginning six months prior. Wooten deliberately chose landing sites beyond the range of Japanese artillery in Lae. [...] "Red Beach" [...] was to the east of the mouth of the Busu River, [...] east of Lae, and [...] "Yellow Beach" [...] near Malahang. This {{was the first time in}} SWPA that beaches were designated with colours. The left end of the beach was marked with a solid red panel mounted on tent poles, the right with one alternating red and white. At night, the left would have a red light, and the right one alternating red and white. Yellow beach was marked the same way, with yellow instead of red. Maps and models of the landing sites were made, and kept closely guarded. Soldiers were made familiar with models of the beaches where they would be landing, but the names were kept secret. Rehearsals were conducted on Normanby Island.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>planning</b> for the CTrain {{played an}} {{important}} role. [...] Although the light rail system was not chosen until 1976, the city planners had proactively reserved transit corridors for some form of high capacity transport during the 1960s, and the right-of-ways for the system were reserved when Calgary's population was less than 500,000, whereas today it is well over twice that number. Bus rapid transit lines {{were put in place}} along future routes to increase commuter numbers prior to constructing proposed future LRT lines. Rather than demolishing buildings, the city reached an agreement with CP Rail to build most of the south line in available space inside an existing CPR right-of-way. Large parts of the other lines were built in the medians and along the edges of freeways and other major roads. Automobile driver objections were muted by adding extra lanes to roads for cars {{at the same time as}} putting in the LRT tracks, which reduced costs for both, and by adding grade-separating intersections which reduced both driver and train delays. [...] The lines and stations were placed to serve large outlying suburbs and the central and other business districts, and to serve existing and predicted travel patterns.|$|E

2500|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Italy, the squadron {{was based in}} Foggia and Termoli {{during the winter of}} 1943. Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officer's swap scheme. He spent most of this time with the Gurkhas of the 8th Indian Infantry Division during the Battle of Monte Cassino. While spending some time on leave in Naples, Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius, which erupted three days later. During the final assault on Monte Cassino, the squadron was based in San Angelo, and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff, and he tripped over one of its live bombs. After the battle, the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome, and Lee visited the city, where he met his mother's cousin, Nicolò Carandini, who had fought in the Italian resistance movement. In November 1944, Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ. Lee took part in <b>forward</b> <b>planning</b> and liaison, in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress. After the war ended, Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in Pörtschach am Wörthersee. For the final few months of his service, Lee, who spoke fluent French and German, among other languages, was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects. Here, he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals. Of his time with the organisation, Lee said: [...] "We were given dossiers of what they'd done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority... We saw these concentration camps. Some had been cleaned up. Some had not." [...] He retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant.|$|E
