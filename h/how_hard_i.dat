[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] because she wanted to shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, judgmental place you can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E
500|$|NBC {{executives}} {{tried to}} solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs. Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I know <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> worked for this. It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Carter recounts how affiliates of NBC complained to the network about the poor ratings performance of Leno's program The Jay Leno Show. O'Brien asked the two NBC executives, [...] "What does Jay have on you? What does this guy have on you people? What the hell is it about Jay?" ...|$|E

Years later, Studdard stated: [...] "A lot of people don't realize <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> was {{trying to get into the}} business before American Idol. I was making demos and just working so hard." [...] A back-up singer from Just a Few Cats asked him to accompany her to Nashville, Tennessee for an audition on the 2003 second season of American Idol.|$|E

[...] He holds {{the distinction of being}} the only player to win Little Brown Jug games playing for both Minnesota and Michigan. [...] Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug {{from the other side of}} the fence, Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: [...] "It will have to be just another game. [...] I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. [...] There won't be any qualms about <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> hit my teammates or how hard they hit me." [...] He did note, though, that he wanted his last college football game to be memorable: [...] "If this is going to be my last game, I'd really like it to be one I can remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> had to work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
2500|$|News {{regarding}} Leno leaked via {{an obscure}} website, FTV Live, {{by the following}} morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien {{as soon as they}} arrived, and although O'Brien had a hint of what was to come, explained the proposed changes. [...] "I know <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> worked for this", responded O'Brien. [...] "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story, and, according to Bill Carter in The War for Late Night, essentially reversed the rumor with a headline reading, [...] "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top." [...] O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action", wrote Carter), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an {{isolated}} set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, [...] "I knew {{this was going to}} be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just <b>how</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> don't ever want to go through this again". For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely. Actor Leo Burmester said, [...] "Shooting The Abyss has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself." [...] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank. Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night. In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.|$|E
