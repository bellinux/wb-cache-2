5|$|Already by 1769–71, both Austria and Prussia had annexed some border territories {{belonging}} to the Commonwealth. On 19 February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna.

Early in August Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves.

5|$|The years {{following}} the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict.

By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.|$|E
5|$|Already by 1769—71, both Austria and Prussia {{had taken}} over some border territories of the Commonwealth, with Austria taking Szepes County in 1769–1770 and Prussia {{incorporating}} Lauenburg and Bütow.

5|$|Following the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters.

Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> {{the wake of the}} incident, Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Majdal {{continued to be}} woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, {{as the use of}} odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E

5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired {{the imagination of the}} public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|From {{the second}} half of the 18th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which had been instituted by Mahmud II, were aimed to modernise the Ottoman state in line with the {{progress}} that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Western Europe. The efforts of Midhat Pasha during the late Tanzimat era led the Ottoman constitutional movement of 1876, which introduced the First Constitutional Era, but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire. As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, especially after the Ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated into the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia, along with the Circassians fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite {{of that in the}} US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E

5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} than anywhere else in occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the decision <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|The cup was {{probably}} made in Alexandria, Egypt. It was {{once thought to}} {{date back to the}} Hellenistic period, c. 250 BC, but is now regarded as dating to the 1st century AD. Its supposed connection with the Ptolemies dates back to a description in 1644 by historian Jean Tristan de Saint-Amant; he argued that the vase was made for the funeral processions of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC. Scholar E. Babelon argued that the cup <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Egypt during the general time of the Ptolemies, a much looser range stretching from 305 to 30 BC. However, there is no particular evidence for this, and other scholars, such as John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway, suggest that the cup was carved later, during the first or second centuries AD by Romans. Dating the cup has been problematic largely because similar pieces are rare, making comparison difficult.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> addition to the contract.|$|E
