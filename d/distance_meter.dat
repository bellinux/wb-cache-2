25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic <b>distance</b> <b>meter</b> (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E

STORED GRAIN VOLUME MEASUREMENT USING A LOW DENSITY POINT CLOUD. Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 33 (1), 105 - 112. doi: 10. 13031 /aea. 11870 This {{technical}} note presents {{the development of}} a new apparatus and data processing method to accurately estimate the volume of stored grain in a bin. Specifically, it was developed to account for the variability in surface topography that can occur in large diameter bins when partially unloaded. This was accomplished using a laser <b>distance</b> <b>meter</b> to create a low density point cloud, from which a surface was interpolated using ArcMap geoprocessing tools. The manually controlled and portable system was designed to hold the laser <b>distance</b> <b>meter</b> and provided a common reference point. The data from the laser <b>distance</b> <b>meter</b> was transmitted to a tablet PC via Bluetooth. Measurement of an empty hopper bottom bin (4. 6 m in diameter and 6. 5 m tall) demonstrated that the system was able to measure a known volume within 0. 02 %, and repeated measures of an empty flat bottom bin (1. 8 m in diameter, and 5. 7 m tall) were within 0. 29 % of the known volume. Two applications are presented which highlight the system's ability to capture complex surfaces, as well as limitations that result from fill scenarios where the field of view was limited...|$|E
