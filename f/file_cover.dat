When performing data hiding in audio, one must exploit the weaknesses of Human Auditory System (HAS), {{while at the same}} time being a ware of the extreme sensitivity of this system. This hiding method is oriented to embed the secret data such that it is capable of surviving against modifications produced by MP 3 compression standard. Statistical and analytical investigations are performed to assess the variations which may occur in the WAVE audio when it is subjected to MP 3 compression. Features of speech signal are exploited (Voiced-Unvoiced segments) for embedding the secret data. Hiding is attempt by shortening or elongating the unvoiced blocks of audio <b>file</b> (<b>cover)</b> data. To support the immunity of the proposed hiding system, an encryption method is added to the proposed hiding system...|$|E

One is spatial domain steganography and another one is Transform domain steganography. The main objective {{to be considered in}} the steganography method is high imperceptibility, due to high imperceptibility viewer cannot view the secret information inside the stego image. In this paper, a transform domain steganography is used for color image. Here integer wavelet transform is applied to each and every R, G, B planes of the image and then information is embedded separately in R, G, B planes. The proposed method is highly capable, rebustness and simple. Therefore we have be used to transfer very highly confidential information like military secrets and etc...|$|E

40|$|Steganography is an {{art that}} {{involves}} the concealing of information {{with the aim of}} making the communication invisible. Unlike cryptography, where the main aim is to secure communications from the Snooper by encoding that data {{in such a way that}} it becomes visible but not understood. In this paper, we propose a framework that will integrate both steganographic and cryptographic approaches within a hyiperd space of an EXE file. This approach will be used for highly securing data that is hidden; using both the advance encryption standard (AES) method and statistical technique (ST) computation. To further address the security issues, we will use the EXE as a cover for the hidden data; the executable <b>file</b> <b>cover</b> was selected in this approach because of its ability to hide huge amounts of data within a hyiperd space of an EXE file which in turn overcomes the problem of the data hiding quantity. The use of the EXE file also makes sure that the changes made to it will not be detected by anti-virus and its functionality will not be negatively affected after the hiding process, features of the short-term responses were simulated, and indicated that the size of the hidden data does depend on the size of the Unused Area 1 + Unused Area 2 + Image Pages; within the cover file which is equal to 28 of the size of the exe. file before the hiding process. Most antivirus systems do not allow direct writing into executable files, so the approach of the proposed system is to prevent the hidden information from being disclosed by these systems and the exe. file still functioning normally after the data hiding process...|$|E

30|$|PDE using steganography. Steganographic file {{systems have}} been {{initially}} proposed by Anderson et al. (1998), with two alternative schemes. In their first scheme, the system {{has a number of}} <b>cover</b> <b>files</b> originally consisting of random bits and the user’s files can be computed using a subset of <b>cover</b> <b>files.</b> This scheme uses a password and the file name to determine which <b>cover</b> <b>files</b> are used. Its drawback is requiring storing a large number of <b>cover</b> <b>files.</b> Moreover, to accommodate files of arbitrary length, the <b>cover</b> <b>files</b> must be relatively large. Their second scheme is based on the computational security of block ciphers. The system is initialized by filling the entire hard disk with random data. A sensitive file is encrypted and stored at disk location being derived from the file name and the password, and the encryption key is also derived in a similar manner. In this way, the adversary is not be able to distinguish blocks containing hidden data from free blocks being filled with random noise. However, when the disk is increasingly filled by hidden files, collision of disk locations may increase, leading to significant over-writes. This is mitigated by writing each block to several disk locations.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{basically}} {{shows us}} how one can hide information in encrypted form to any <b>cover</b> <b>file</b> such as. exe files, Microsoft office files,. dbf files, image files, audio files and video files. However, {{the size of}} the hidden message must be very small in comparison to <b>cover</b> <b>file</b> which is an executable file. So far no one has tried to hide information inside any executable file. To make the system fully secured we first encrypt the secret message using MSA algorithm (Nath et al. (1)) and then we hide the encrypted message inside the <b>cover</b> <b>file.</b> introduced a new method for hiding any encrypted secret message inside a <b>cover</b> <b>file.</b> For encrypting secret message we have used new algorithm proposed by Nath et al(1). For hiding secret message we have changed both LSB and LSB+ 1 bits of each byte of the <b>cover</b> <b>file.</b> A generalized method was proposed by Nath etal(2) where they embed the secret message without going for any encryption [...] The MSA(1) algorithm introduced a new randomization method for generating the randomized key matrix to encrypt plain text file and to decrypt cipher text file. The MSA (1) method also incorporates the multiple encryption and decryption process. To initiate the MSA algorithm the user has to enter a text_key, which can be of 16 characters long. This text_key is used to calculate the randomization number and the encryption number from the given text_key. The size of the encryption key matrix is 16 x 16 and the total number of matrices can be formed from 16 x 16 is 256 ! which is quite large and the MSA algorithm ensures that any of the pattern may be used for encryption as well as decryption process. To hide encrypted secret message in the <b>cover</b> <b>file</b> we have inserted the 8 bits of each character of encrypted message file in 4 consecutive bytes of the <b>cover</b> <b>file</b> such that only LSB and LSB+ 1 bits are changed depending on the bit pattern of the encrypted secret message. To make system further secured one has to enter a password before the actual steganography process starts. We propose that our new method could be most appropriate for hiding any file in any non-standard <b>cover</b> <b>file</b> such as executable file, compiler, MS-Office files, Data Base files such as. DBF, text editor such as notepad plus the standard <b>cover</b> <b>files</b> such as image, audio, video files etc. The size of the secret message be very small in comparison to the executable <b>cover</b> <b>file.</b> The present method may be implemented in mobile network, Bank data transactions in government sectors, in police department...|$|R
