[...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This {{is going to be}} different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone {{for the rest of my}} life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E

[...] <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a burden more than a fun-loving game. I promised my family and myself when I started coaching that I would get out when it stopped being fun. Unfortunately, it's reached that point." [...] In six years under Schmidt, the Lions compiled a 43–34–7 record and finished in second place each year from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{became known}} as [...] "Jiggle TV" [...] and [...] "T TV" [...] (or [...] "Tits & Ass Television") by critics who {{believed}} that the show had no intelligence or substance. These characterizations stemmed {{from the fact that}} the lead actresses frequently dressed scantily or provocatively as part of their undercover characters (including roller derby girl, beauty pageant contestant, maid, female prisoner, or just bikini-clad), and the belief that their clothing was a means of attracting viewers. Farrah Fawcett once attributed the show's success to this fact: [...] "When the show was number three, I figured it was our acting. When <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra." ...|$|E
