40|$|It is {{difficult}} to use industrial explosives to excavate hard rock and achieve suitable blasting effect due to the low energy utilization rate resulting in large rocks and short blasting footage. Thus, improving the utilization ratio of the explosive energy is important. In this study, a novel bilinear initiation system based on hard rock blasting was proposed to improve the blasting effects. Furthermore, {{on the basis of}} the detonation wave collision theory, frontal collision, oblique reflection, and Mach reflection during detonation wave propagation were studied. The results show that the maximum detonation pressure at the Mach reflection point where the incident angle is 46. 9 ° is three times larger than the value of the explosive complete detonation. Then, in order to analyze the crack propagation in different initiation forms, a rock fracture test slot was designed, and the results show that bilinear initiating system can change the energy <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Finally, field experiment was implemented at the hard rock pile blasting engineering, and experimental results show that the present system possesses high explosive energy utilization ratio and low rock fragments size.

We provide data on the pollination biology of the five extant species (Trilepidea is extinct). The two Peraxilla species and Trilepidea have recently {{been shown to have}} explosive flowers.

40|$|Studies <b>of</b> grain-size <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> {{volcanic}} eruptions {{provide important insights}} into fragmentation mechanisms and eruptive conditions and are crucial to the modeling of tephra dispersal. As a result of sedimentation processes and plume dynamics, grain-size features vary significantly both in the downwind and crosswind directions and are difficult to characterize. We have analyzed grain-size features in the downwind and crosswind directions of the two largest eruptions of the last 2000 years of Cotopaxi volcano activity (Ecuador). Crosswind grain-size variations are similar for both eruptions (i. e., layers 3 and 5), while at any given downwind distance from vent, the layer 3 deposit is coarser than the layer 5 one. This suggests that layers 3 and 5 were characterized by similar plume height but that layer 3 was advected by a stronger wind. In addition, both deposits are coarsest along the dispersal axis and become richer in ash in the crosswind direction showing a Gaussian decreasing rate. Deposit thickness also shows a Gaussian crosswind decay, but layer 3 is significantly thicker at all points than is layer 5 due to the former's larger erupted mass. Based on both quantitative analysis of field data and on numerical simulations, we show that tephra deposits associated with large explosive eruptions (i. e., plume height of 30 km) should be sampled out to at least 200 km from the vent (depending on wind speed and tropopause height) in order to derive complete grain-size distributions that are not depleted in fines. Eruptions occurring in a strong wind field at high latitudes (e. g., Iceland) require lesser representative-sampling distances because of the lower tropopause heights...|$|R

A major recurring problem is the representation of diffusion processes of these compounds on soils due their different and complex properties. The aim of this work was to describe {{the transport}} of 2, 4, 6 –Trinitrotoluene (TNT) on Ottawa sand using a mathematical model. The microscopic mass transfer of TNT on sand particles was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled to Energy Dispersed X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (EDAX).

By applying the same method used in Zapata et al.

At the moment {{there are only two}} well established cases <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> outflows, but with the full availability of ALMA we expect that more examples will be found in the near future. Main results are the largely different spatial <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosive</b> flows, consisting <b>of</b> numerous narrow straight filament-like ejections with different orientations and in almost an isotropic configuration, the red with respect to the blueshifted components of the flows (maximally separated in protostellar, largely overlapping in explosive outflows), the very well-defined Hubble flow-like increase of velocity with distance from the origin in the explosive filaments versus the mostly non-organized CO velocity field in protostellar objects, and huge inequalities in mass, momentum and energy of the two classes, at least for the case of low-mass flows. Finally, all the molecular filaments in the explosive outflows point back to approximately a central position i. e. the place where its "exciting source" was located, contrary to the bulk of the molecular material within the protostellar outflows.

40|$|Solar {{explosive}} {{events are}} commonly explained as small scale magnetic reconnection events, although unambiguous confirmation of this scenario remains elusive {{due to the}} lack of spatial resolution and of the statistical analysis of large enough samples of this type of events. In this work, we propose a sound statistical treatment of data cubes consisting of a temporal sequence of long slit spectra of the solar atmosphere. The analysis comprises all the stages from the explosive event detection to its characterization and the subsequent sample study. We have designed two complementary approaches based on the combination of standard statistical techniques (Robust Principal Component Analysis in one approach and wavelet decomposition and Independent Component Analysis in the second) in order to obtain least biased samples. These techniques are implemented in the spirit of letting the data speak for themselves. The analysis is carried out for two spectral lines: the C IV line at 1548. 2 angstroms and the Ne VIII line at 770. 4 angstroms. We find significant differences between the characteristics of the line profiles emitted in the proximities of two active regions, and in the quiet Sun, most visible in the relative importance of a separate population of red shifted profiles. We also find a higher frequency <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> events near the active regions, and in the C IV line.
