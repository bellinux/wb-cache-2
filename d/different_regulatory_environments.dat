40|$|A {{reduction}} in information asymmetry, and hence in the monitoring burden between agent and principal, {{is one of}} the aims of the regulation of financial reporting disclosure in active capital markets. Theoretical models of voluntary disclosure have sought to explain the persistence of information asymmetry in terms of the perceptions of those who supply information and those who use it in market decisions. In the late 1990 s listed companies in the US and the UK implemented annual report disclosures to satisfy regulatory requirements for disclosure relating to foreign currency risk management. This paper presents empirical evidence of financial statement disclosure where the information asymmetry may be assessed by comparing ex post the explicit disclosure of information in the annual report with prior questionnaire responses from the same companies. It shows, through a two-country comparison, that disclosure regulations drawn up at similar times and with similar driving forces, can have a different impact in two <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments.</b> Also, in both regulatory regimes a substantial element of information asymmetry remains, consistent with the expectations generated from the theoretical voluntary disclosure models. The paper concludes that regulation of qualitative disclosures, while taking heed of the market's requirements for information, has not yet found the mechanism whereby transparency is complete...|$|E

Chapter 3 coven the institutional details of the Hong Kong stock market and the specification of datasets. The descriptive statistics of the trading activities of the sample companies are also presented. An understanding of these descriptive statistics is useful in choosing the appropriate theoretical model and econometric techniques in the analysis. Apart form using regression analysis to investigate the impacts of transitory volatility on market depth and order-flow composition; additional control measures are also implemented. For instance, matched samples based on market depth, transitory volatility, daily trading volume, etc. are constructed. Statistical Tests are employed to investigate the influence of investor protection. Chapter 4 presents the results of the regression models. Apart form investigating the impacts of transitory volatility on market depth and order-flow composition, this chapter also contributes to the literature by examining the distinction (of this interaction) between companies under <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environment.</b> It is found that the liquidity replenishments for Hong Kong-based companies are more rapid than their Chinese counterparts. The results show that companies ruled by strict governance regulations provide more liquidity when liquidity is most needed. Additional test results also suggest that this difference is robust to various control criteria. Chapter 5 gives the summary and conclusions. In this dissertation, data on the Hong Kong Exchange (HKEx) are employed. The Hong Kong equity market lists companies from distinct investor protection environments. These companies are traded under the same market mechanism even though they have different levels of legal protection for investors e. g. Hang Seng Index (HSI) Constituents versus H-shares/red chips. The HKEx is also a very good example of pure order driven markets. Stock prices are determined by the buy and sell orders submitted by traders without liquidity providers of the last resort. Therefore, the Hong Kong equity market provides a unique opportunity to compare the liquidity replenishment process across diverse <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments,</b> but still under one pure order driven market trading with the same mechanism and currency. The choice of Hong Kong data is also justified {{on the grounds of the}} size of the Hong Kong market and the increasing importance of Hong Kong in worldwide financial market. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the importance of investor protection for the dynamics between liquidity provision and transitory volatility in a pure order-driven market. I posit that environments with better investor protection lead to a more stable ecological system of the supply and the demand of liquidity. This dissertation has five chapters.

We explored the development of young children 2 ̆ 7 s brand knowledge of foods highly advertised on television – both healthy and less healthy. Participants were 172 children aged 3 – 5 [*]years in diverse socio-economic settings, from two jurisdictions {{on the island of}} Ireland with <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments.</b> Results indicated that food brand knowledge (i) did not differ across jurisdictions; (ii) increased significantly between 3 and 4 [*]years; and (iii) children had significantly greater knowledge of unhealthy food brands, compared with similarly advertised healthy brands.

However, (v) unhealthy brand knowledge was significantly related to all these factors, although only parent eating and children 2 ̆ 7 s age were independent predictors. Findings indicate that effects of food marketing for unhealthy foods take place through routes other than television advertising alone, and are present before pre-schoolers develop the concept of healthy eating. Implications are that marketing restrictions of unhealthy foods should extend beyond television advertising; and that family-focused obesity prevention programmes should begin before children are 3 [*]years of age...|$|E

The growing number of home-based teleworkers, e-entrepreneurs and high-rank information workers and firms who are very selective on their live/work locations heralds a new era with a great emphasis on the productive side of residential communities. In this regard, very little knowledge has been produced on the planning regulations that actually facilitate this new role of residential communities and support community-based information work. This paper benefits from empirical data collected from two case studies in the US and Australia where residential communities attempt to attract communitybased information work. It investigates how these two case studies under <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> respond to the new life/work style of information workers. The result of this investigation opens discussions about the efficient regulatory environment that actually persuades community-based information work. It notes that the new social group of community-based information workers asks for a set of planning regulations that acknowledge their work right, integrates their live/work experience, and creates a mixed-use support system for their different life/work style. This conclusion once again emphasizes the significant share of regulatory environments to adjust the residential communities for their new role in the digital age, and sheds light on the long way ahead to embrace the transformation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{international}} agricultural trade has grown significantly. Technological advances in transportation logistics and storage have created opportunities to ship anything almost anywhere. Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements have also opened new pathways to an increasingly global market place. Yet, international agricultural trade is often constrained by differences in regulatory regimes. The impact of “regulatory asymmetry” is particularly acute for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that lack resources and expertise to successfully operate in markets that have substantially different regulatory structures. As governments seek to encourage the development of SMEs, policy makers often confront the critical question of what ultimately motivates SME export behavior. Specifically, there is considerable interest in understanding how SMEs confront the challenges of regulatory asymmetry. Neoclassical models of the firm generally emphasize expected profit maximization under uncertainty, however these approaches do not adequately explain the entrepreneurial decision under regulatory asymmetry. Behavioral theories of the firm offer a far richer understanding of decision making by taking into account aspirations and adaptive performance in risky environments. This paper develops an analytical framework for decision making of a single agent. Considering risk, uncertainty and opportunity cost, the analysis focuses on the export behavior response of an SME {{in a situation of}} regulatory asymmetry.

40|$|AbstractThe European project NearCO 2 is {{investigating}} European public perceptions of CCS via case studies (both CCS and analogous energy infrastructure), surveys, and focus groups. (The NearCO 2 project is funded under the FP 7 Programme of DG Research at the European Commission. It {{was launched in}} April of 2009 and will terminate in March 2011.) The overall aim of the project is to investigate communication strategies {{that are designed to}} convey to stakeholders and to the public the advantages and risks of CO 2 capture and storage. These same strategies may also be used to involve these parties in local decision-making on CCS projects. This paper describes the results of the first phase of investigation of the NearCO 2 project, which focuses on lessons learned from consultation related to CCS project implementation and analogous developments in recent years. Eight case studies have been reviewed to help determine the nature of the communications and consultation strategies used by project developers as part of energy project approval processes. The chosen range of case studies represents a number of <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments</b> throughout the European Union and a number of different technologies.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the problem of}} determining runway fees at major commercial airports when the objective is the maximization of social benefits. Unlike most of the analytical work that has been performed to date, the economic model used here takes into consideration time variations in airport demand and extends earlier results to this more realistic case. As with earlier models, the one used here demonstrates clearly {{the differences in the}} optimal tolls that result from assuming <b>different</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>environments.</b> An alternative model, based on the concept of Pareto optimality, not only leads to the same results as the traditional approach, but also allows consideration of some additional factors such as frequency of service and average load factors. In particular, it is shown that when low load factors are sufficiently valued by passengers, optimality does not require that aircraft fly full, even in the presence of sizable delays. An example is worked out in detail, illustrating many of these points and especially how an appropriately determined peak hour surcharge can reduce substantially congestion and result in increased social benefits from the airport facility. Finally, the experience of the Port of New York Authority in New York airports and that of the British Airports Authority at Heathrow is discussed briefly and compared with the conclusions of this report.
