5|$|During {{the days}} before the storm's arrival in Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories. Extensive {{preparations}} that resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials—including bread and butter—as people prepared for the storm.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E
5|$|The 1761 Milestone is a {{milestone}} on 640 South Main Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The stone originally marked {{the junction of}} a Colonial highway from Great Road and an east-west route from Boston, Massachusetts, {{to the state of}} Connecticut. The stone was rediscovered during the installation of an electrical road (likely a tram). In 1898, the stone was reportedly restored to its original location by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The stone is embedded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> retaining wall at the corner of South Main Street and Smithfield Road. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1982, and is historically significant as Colonial-era highway marker.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E

The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century.

5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|The season had {{fourteen}} tropical depressions, {{of which}} seven intensified into tropical stormsan average season has ten tropical stormsthree became hurricanes and one, Emily, {{became a major}} hurricane. The inactivity throughout the basin was linked to persistent, strong vertical wind shear; most of the season's storms were unable to intensify due to the shear, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> number of named storms and hurricanes. The two most notable storms of the season were Hurricanes Arlene and Emily. Hurricane Arlene spent roughly 14.5 days as a tropical storm before intensifying into a hurricane, the longest span between these intensities on record. Hurricane Emily was the only major hurricane of the season; its wind speeds peaked at 125mph (205km/h) before impacting the Dominican Republic. Three fatalities occurred in the Dominican Republic because of the storm and damages were estimated up to $80.3 million (1987USD).|$|E

Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing to bat for a second time.

5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E

Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick.

5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, and a chance was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as the keeper didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E
