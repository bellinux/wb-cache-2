Whatever money the bank receives by way of deposits, it lends {{a major part of}} it to its customers by way of loans, advances, cash credit and overdraft. <b>Interest</b> <b>received</b> <b>on</b> such <b>loans</b> and advances is the major source of its income. The banks have a major contribution to the economic development of the country by granting loans to the industrial and agricultural sectors. The banks make loans and advances out of deposits, received from their customers. Most of these deposits are payable on demand. As such the bank owes a greater responsibility to the depositors. Hence he should be extremely careful while granting loans...|$|R

To develop a systematic group of actions {{in order to allow}} the “economic and financial” system of the country to work efficiently, irrespective of economic and financial world cataclysms.

A retrospective analysis of the essence of theories of credit and lending rate has been made. Some aspects of <b>interest</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>on</b> deposits and <b>loans</b> {{from the point of view}} of a radically new economic model of management, which based on the "National economy high-performance theory», are considered. Using the simulation modeling the negative influence of bank interest on the national economy general development is indicated.

A radically new model of banking system functioning in the country is proposed. This system allows one to create synergistic economic effect. Practical value. Implementation of the given model will provide the GDP growth for the 2 – 2. 5 times as early as the first years. The economic effect of the introduction can bring about 1 trillion UAH...|$|R
