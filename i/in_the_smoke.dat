Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces were lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> and retreated.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} was to {{characterize}} the functional parameters of smoked soft cheese, with the emphasis on the behavior of water and milk fat, as analyzed by DSC, which was used to directly measure the melting/freezing phase transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cheese. This study was complemented by NMR measurements of the organization and distribution of the aqueous phase within the emulsions constituting <b>the</b> cheese. <b>The</b> <b>smoked</b> and unsmoked cheeses were characterized by similar compositions in terms of protein (19. 08 - 19. 12 g∙ 100 g- 1), fat (18. 86 - 19. 02 g∙ 100 g- 1), and water content (59. 86 - 60. 27 g∙ 100 g- 1). The water activity was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unsmoked cheese (aw = 0. 9736) than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> cheese (aw = 0. 9615). This result was confirmed by DSC (higher ice melting enthalpy) and NMR (higher T 1 value) measurements. The smoking process led to differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution and binding of water to the lipid-protein matrix of the cheese.

Cardiff fired the most of any ship in her squadron, but did not hit any German ships. She was, however, hit four or five times herself, killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen, but was only lightly damaged. Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea.

The crude protein content of <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> fish samples ranged from 15. 18 % in sawdust heat treatment to 63. 23 % in electric oven heat source with CV % of 10. 68 while crude fat range values were 9. 47 – 16. 44 % (CV % = 18. 80). The most highly concen-trated mineral was sodium (7. 00 – 9. 95 mg/ 100 g sample) and strictly followed by magnesium (5. 45 – 7. 45 mg/ 100 g sam-ple).
