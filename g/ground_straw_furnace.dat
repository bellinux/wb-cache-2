40|$|Appropriate {{agricultural}} practices for carbon sequestration and emission mitigation {{have a significant}} influence on global climate change. However, various {{agricultural practices}} on farmland carbon sequestration usually {{have a major impact}} on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is very important to accurately quantify the effect of agricultural practices. This study developed a platform—the Denitrification Decomposition (DNDC) online model—for simulating and evaluating the agricultural carbon sequestration and emission mitigation based on the scientific process of the DNDC model, which is widely used in the simulation of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. After testing the adaptability of the platform on two sampling fields, it turned out that the simulated values matched the measured values well for crop yields and GHG emissions. We used the platform to estimate the effect of three carbon sequestration practices in a sampling field: nitrogen fertilization reduction, straw residue and midseason drainage. The results indicated the following: (1) moderate decrement of the nitrogen fertilization in the sampling field was able to decrease the N 2 O emission while maintaining the paddy rice yield; (2) <b>ground</b> <b>straw</b> residue had almost no influence on paddy rice yield, but the CH 4 emission and the surface SOC concentration increased along with the quantity of the straw residue; (3) compared to continuous flooding, midseason drainage would not decrease the paddy rice yield and could lead to a drop in CH 4 emission. Thus, this study established the DNDC online model, which is able to serve as a reference and support for the study and evaluation of the effects of agricultural practices on agricultural carbon sequestration and GHG emissions mitigation in China...|$|R

The experimental design was a split plot consisting of two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares. Increasing straw level reduced ruminal (p 0. 10) by wheat straw level. Likewise, straw level did not influence ruminal acetate and propionate molar proportions or estimated methane production (p> 0. 10). Pelleting straw did not affect (p≥ 0. 48) ruminal digestion of OM, NDF, and starch, or microbial efficiency. Ruminal feed N digestion was greater (7. 4 %; p = 0. 02) for ground than for pelleted wheat straw diets. Although ruminal starch digestion was not affected by straw processing, post-ruminal (p 0. 14) by corn processing. However, microbial N flow to the small intestine and ruminal N efficiency (non-ammonia N flow to the small intestine/N intake) were greater (p< 0. 01) for steam-flaked than for dry rolled corn-based diets. Ruminal pH and total VFA concentration were not affected (p≥ 0. 16) by corn processing method. Compared with dry rolled corn, steam-flaked corn-based diets resulted in decreased acetate:propionate molar ratio (p = 0. 02). It is concluded that at 7 % or 14 % straw inclusion rate, changes in physical characteristics of wheat straw brought about by pelleting negatively impact OM digestion of both steam-flaked and dry-rolled corn-based finishing diets. This effect is due to decreased post-ruminal starch digestion. Replacement of <b>ground</b> <b>straw</b> with pelleted straw also may decrease ruminal pH...|$|R

30|$|Considerable {{reductions}} {{of the heavy}} metal concentrations (Fig.  2) in the experimental pits that supported successful colonization and growth of the oyster mushroom coincided with comparatively near neutral pH values and had the highest mushroom fruit body yield and heavy metal uptake (Fig.  4). This clearly demonstrated that the successful propagation of the oyster mushroom in the mine dump waste has bioremediative outcomes in the decontamination of mine overburden material. It has been reported previously that pH {{is one of the}} variables influencing the bioavailability and transport of heavy metals in the waste, and heavy metal mobility decreases substantially with increasing soil pH due to the precipitation of hydroxides, carbonates or the formation of insoluble organic complexes [25]. Consequently, dump site pits that received viable oyster mushroom spawn and <b>ground</b> wheat <b>straw</b> substrate recorded significant pH increases accompanied by considerable reductions in the concentrations of the mobile heavy metals (Fig.  2).|$|R
40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{represents}} {{an important part}} of the agricultural wastes that can be transformed into a renewable energy. The biodegradability and biodegradation kinetics of ultra-finely <b>ground</b> wheat <b>straw</b> was studied under mesophilic anaerobic conditions. Biological methane potential (BMP) tests and batch reactors were performed on samples resulting from successive grinding processes (759 – 48 μm). The main conclusion is that micronization do not improve methane yield but has a positive effect on the biodegradation kinetics. In addition, the results presented here showed for the first time that no significant increase of kinetics was observed below a size threshold value around 200 μm. This can be explained by the modifications in the lignocellulosic network from 759 to 200 μm but not below 200 μm. Therefore, micronization, increasing significantly the kinetics of anaerobic digestion, can decrease the retention time or the size of the digesters to treat the same quantity of waste...|$|R
6000|$|It happened, however, {{that there}} was {{in the city of}} Megalopolis at this time a soldier named Damides, who had served in former years under Alexander the Great, in Asia. He went to the {{officers}} who had command within the city and offered his aid. [...] "Fear nothing," [...] said he, [...] "but go on with your preparations of defense, and leave the elephants to me. I will answer for them, if you will do as I say." [...] The officers agreed to follow his instructions. He immediately caused a great number of sharp iron spikes to be made. These spikes he set firmly in the ends of short stakes of wood, and then planted the stakes in the ground all about the intrenchments and in the breach, in such a manner that the spikes themselves, points upward, protruded from the ground. The spikes were then concealed from view by covering the <b>ground</b> with <b>straw</b> and other similar rubbish.|$|R
40|$|Different thermo-mechanical {{extrusion}} pretreatments {{were evaluated}} as alternatives to traditional biomass pretreatments for lignocellulosic ethanol production. Wheat straw, a commonly available agricultural co-product, {{was chosen as}} the substrate model for the study. Five thermo-mechanical pretreatments were evaluated: one purely thermo-mechanical (TM) using just water, and the rest thermo-mechano-chemical (TMC), thus using acid, alkaline, oxidant in alkaline medium, and organic solvent. The parietal constituents, hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin were quantified to enable the amounts extracted by the pretreatment to be estimated. The digestibility of cellulose was evaluated by quantifying the hydrolysability with an enzyme cocktail. Water thermomechanical treatment gave strong straw defibration; however the digestibility only attained 35 %, whereas <b>ground</b> wheat <b>straw</b> was already 22 %. This improvement is insufficient to prepare material for direct enzymatic hydrolysis; thus a combination of the thermo-mechanical and chemical treatment is required. All chemical treatments produced greater improvements in cellulose digestibility. For the acidic treatments, hydrolysability was between 42 and 50 %, and reached 89 % with alkaline pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparative}} studies on using rice straw, corn cob, rice husk, penut hull, sugar cane bagasse, rice bran, {{as a substrate}} for xylanase production by Aspergillus fumigatus strain 4 - 45 - 1 F, rice straw {{was found to be}} the best substrate. Maximum xylanase production (16. 8 × 104 units/g rice straw) was obtained when 1. 2 × 105 spores/g rice straw were grown at 40 °C for 6 days on a substrate containing 5 mesh <b>ground</b> rice <b>straw,</b> supplemented with 0. 8 % (w/w) NH 4 NO 3 and 82 g rice straw/ 100 ml of water, at initial pH of 4. 5. The previous induction of xylanase production by using xylan as a substrate for cultivation of spore inoculum was not necessary. In addition to xylanase, a substantial amount of cellulase was also detected. Hydrolysis of various cellulosic wastes by the crude xylanase prepared showed that the highest amount of reducing sugar (0. 26 g/g) was obtained when sugar can...|$|R
