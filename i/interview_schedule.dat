5000|$|Perhaps due {{to their}} {{perceived}} rarity, the dissociative disorders (including DID) were not initially included in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), {{which is designed to}} make psychiatric diagnoses more rigorous and reliable. [...] Instead, shortly after the publication of the initial SCID a freestanding protocol for dissociative disorders (SCID-D) was published. [...] This interview takes about 30 to 90 minutes depending on the subject's experiences. An alternative diagnostic instrument, the Dissociative Disorders <b>Interview</b> <b>Schedule,</b> also exists but the SCID-D is generally considered superior.

50|$|The Dissociative Disorders <b>Interview</b> <b>Schedule</b> (DDIS) is {{a highly}} {{structured}} interview which makes DSM-IV diagnoses of somatization disorder, borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder, {{as well as all}} the dissociative disorders.

50|$|Diagnosis is made {{based on}} a {{clinical}} interview by a psychiatrist or other licensed mental health practitioner. There are no blood tests or brain scans to diagnose BD.

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the fear of crime debate is the fear-risk paradox: the finding that those least at risk, namely, elderly women, are most fearful, and vice versa. This article argues that this paradox can be {{resolved}} theoretically by placing an anxious, defended subject rather than a rational, risk-avoiding one {{at the center of the}} debate, and explores some of the methodological implications of so doing, especially the importance of eliciting narratives. This methodological position, appropriately adapted for this study’s rather different purposes, derives from the biographical-interpretive method first developed in Germany for the collection of life stories of Jewish survivors of the concentration camps. The authors outline the principles of this approach and the importance of eliciting concrete stories in a nondirective way in pursuit of the respondent’s "gestalt, " and then put this to work in attempting to operationalize their theoretical position into appropriate <b>interview</b> <b>schedules.</b> Specifically, the authors contrast the results of pilot <b>interview</b> <b>schedules</b> conducted in traditional question-and-answer format, in which "why " ques-tions loom large, with those obtained by a schedule based on eliciting narratives from respondents, demonstrating both what the former misses and the latter (unconsciously...|$|R

50|$|Central or batch {{scheduling}} {{that shift}} {{the control of}} the scheduling process away from parents and back to the school and use a priority-based, multi-phase process. Parents place scheduling requests on-line for the teachers whom {{they would like to see}} in the order of their priority and include information about their time availability. The software then schedules all requests as a whole. This results in parents getting to see their top priority teachers, but potentially missing out on 'lower-priority' ones. This trade-off is in contrast to the first-come-first-served type systems, where only the parents who schedule early may get the interview slots they need. After the overall batch produced <b>interview</b> <b>schedule</b> is published by the school, parents may go on-line for a second round of bookings to make changes or (new) late bookings, or to try to book the low-priority teachers that they missed out on in the first round. Centrally scheduled systems also claim to improve the issue of core subject teachers being over-booked.|$|E

5000|$|Psychiatrists August Piper and Harold Merskey have {{challenged}} the trauma hypothesis, arguing that correlation {{does not imply}} causation—the fact that people with DID report childhood trauma does not mean trauma causes DID—and point to the rareness of the diagnosis before 1980 {{as well as a}} failure to find DID as an outcome in longitudinal studies of traumatized children. They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as [...] "personality state" [...] and [...] "identities", and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years. Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey's conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Dissociative Disorders <b>Interview</b> <b>Schedule</b> and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders) that are in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In his opinion, Piper and Merskey are setting the standard of proof higher than they are for other diagnoses. He also asserts that Piper and Merskey have cherry-picked data and not incorporated all relevant scientific literature available, such as independent corroborating evidence of trauma.|$|E
