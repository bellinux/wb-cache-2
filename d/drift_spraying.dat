The <b>drifting</b> of <b>sprays</b> is a highly complex process influenced by many factors.

Experiments were conducted to quantify <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> and describe its movement from aerial applications of pesticide. The effects of spray quality, atomizer type and ground cover were examined. Initial airborne drift amounts were greater than downwind deposits, thus not all of the <b>drifting</b> <b>spray</b> was deposited in the measuring area. Total off-target movement of spray was significantly greater for Fine compared to Coarse sprays. Rotary and hydraulic atomizers, both producing Fine sprays, produced statistically similar off-target movement of sprays. Similarly, no significant statistical differences in <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> between applications to bare ground and applications to a headed barley crop canopy were not identified. Contrary to expectations, aerial application to bare ground seemed to result in less off-target movement than application to a crop canopy. The vertical spray cloud profiles were similar for all applications with the greatest amount of spray present at the height of release. Spray concentrations diminished from that height upward with diffusion and downward with deposition. The empirical data disagreed with the mechanistic model AgDISP which is currently used in the Canadian regulatory process. The model over-predicted drift deposition by a factor of two to five. Variability in spray deposit values could not be attributed to average differences in meteorological conditions at the time of application.

Furthermore, only small variations were measured within the various groups of collectors used for these arrangements. Generally, the highest spray deposition outside the treated area was measured close to the sprayed plot and was accompanied by a high variability of values, while a rapid decline of deposits was detected in more remote areas. Estimations of spray deposits with the IMAG Drift Calculator were in accordance with experimental findings only for areas located at a distance of 0. 5 - 4. 5 m from the last nozzle, while there was an overestimation of a factor of 4 at a distance of 2. 0 - 3. 0 m, thus revealing a high level of uncertainty of the estimation of deposition for short distances. Airborne <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> measured by passive and active air collecting systems was approximately at the same level, when taking into consideration the collector efficiency of the woven nylon wire used as sampling material for the passive collecting system. The maximum value of total airborne <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> for both <b>spray</b> applications (0. 79 % of the applied dose) was determined by the active collecting system. However, the comparatively high variability of measurements at various heights above the soil by active and passive collecting systems revealed need for further studies to elucidate the spatial pattern of airborne <b>spray</b> <b>drift...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Cascade Project {{describes}} the modelling of <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> and pesticide fate for {{a network of}} interconnected water bodies in a rural area. A {{first part of the}} project, the Cascade Drift Model, models the spatial and temporal distribution of deposits of <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> onto surface waters in the mentioned rural area. Deposits of <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> are computed using a generic drift function, derived by multiple linear regression from a large set of random scenarios computed by the IDEFICS <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> model. The Cascade Drift Model takes into account the adjustment of parameters such as day-to-day weather conditions, water management measures (regulating water levels), and the choices a farmer has to make regarding spray application. The model enables a realistic evaluation of drift deposits onto surface waters in a certain region during a season and the effects of various measures affecting drift deposition. Results will be used subsequently in the next part of the project, the Cascade Fate Model, which models the fate of pesticides in water bodies. First computations give an insight into the variations occurring under varying conditions due to the geometry of the investigated area and changing weather condition...|$|R
40|$|Agrichemical <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> is {{an issue}} of concern for the orcharding industry. Shelterbelts {{surrounding}} orchard blocks can significantly reduce <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> by intercepting droplets from the airflow. At present, there is little information available with which to predict drift deposits downwind, particularly {{in the case of a}} fully-sheltered orchard block. In this thesis, we develop a simple mathematical model for the transport of airborne <b>drifting</b> <b>spray</b> droplets, including the effects of droplet evaporation and interception by a shelterbelt. The object is for the model to capture the major features of the droplet transport, yet be simple enough to determine an analytic solution, so that the deposit on the ground may be easily calculated and the effect of parameter variations observed. We model the droplet transport using an advection-dispersion equation, with a trapping term added to represent the shelterbelt. In order to proceed analytically, we discretise the shelterbelt by dividing it into a three-dimensional array of blocks, with the trapping in each block concentrated to the point at its centre. First, we consider the more straightforward case where the droplets do not evaporate; solutions are presented in one, two and three dimensions, along with explicit expressions for the total amount trapped and the deposit on the ground. With evaporation, the model is more difficult to solve analytically, and the solutions obtained are nestled in integral equations which are evaluated numerically. In both cases, examples are presented to show the deposition profile on the ground downwind of the shelterbelt, and the corresponding reduction in deposit from the same scenario without the shelterbelt...|$|R

The <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> deposit of each droplet diameter class measured by a laser particle analyser is computed independently. The summation of these footprints results in the global drift of the nozzle. The methodology is applied to derive from the model the drift of a flat fan nozzle located in a wind tunnel.

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> are usually {{carried out by}} passive collectors and tracers. However, these methods are labour- and time-intensive and only provide point- and time-integrated measurements. Unlike these methods, the {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) technique allows real-time measurements, obtaining information with temporal and spatial resolution. Recently, the authors have developed the first eye-safe lidar system specifically designed for <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> monitoring. This prototype is based on a 1534 erbium-doped glass laser and an 80 mm diameter telescope, has scanning capability, and is easily transportable. This paper presents the results of the first experimental campaign carried out with this instrument. High coefficient of determination (R 2 > 0. 85) were observed by comparing lidar {{measurements of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> with those obtained by horizontal collectors. Furthermore, the lidar system allowed an assessment of the drift reduction potential (DRP) when comparing low-drift nozzles with standard ones, resulting in a DRP of 57 %(preliminaryresult) for the tested nozzles. The lidar system was also used for monitoring the evolution of the spray flux over the canopy and to generate 2 -D images of these plumes. The developed instrument is an advantageous alternative to passive collectors and opens the possibility of new methods for field measurement of <b>spray</b> <b>drift.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{concern about}} environmental effect of pesticides use {{has resulted in}} abundant research on <b>spray</b> <b>drift.</b> <b>Spray</b> <b>drift</b> modelling has been developed {{to get a better}} understanding of the parameters involved and better estimation of the off-target spray deposit. Two groups of models have received extensive a. ttention: Random-walk and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used to predict the effect of: nozzle height, spray pressure, wind speed, [...] . and were v. alidated with wind tunnels trials. Statistical models based on field trials results have been developed to estimate off-target spray deposit for different sprayers in various environmental conditions. A third group, Gaussian dispersion models, have received early attention in <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> modelling but are not so popular, despite their international success in environmental pollution modelling. The adaptation of such a model to ground spraying is proposed. The nozzle droplet size distribution measured with a Malvern laser particle analyser is used to divide the nozzle output into several size classes. The spray deposit (or footprint) of each diameter class is computed. The summation of these footprints results in the global drift of the nozzle.
