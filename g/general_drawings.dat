Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 <b>general</b> <b>drawings</b> and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved {{in the design and}} the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1mm (0.04in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on the anchoring bolts in the masonry foundation blocks.

Those {{for the east}} and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m concrete slabs, {{one for each of}} the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m long and 6 m in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m thick.

This investigation explores a practical approach to introduce Human Factors and Ergonomics knowledge early in ship design by utilizing <b>general</b> arrangement <b>drawings</b> as a common platform for stakeholder input throughout ship development. An onboard data collection was completed using a cargo ship and its crew as a case study. A comparative analysis between the ship's two-dimensional <b>general</b> arrangement <b>drawings</b> from which the structure was built, and the constructed onboard work environment was performed. Additionally, the engine crew was job-shadowed and interviewed to gain insight into their work demands and movement within the space. <b>General</b> arrangement <b>drawings</b> were found to be incomplete and when directly compared to a finalized product indicated inaccuracies in design and work environment characteristics, making comprehensive human element evaluations difficult. However, <b>general</b> arrangement <b>drawings</b> were found advantageous in mapping and visualizing logistical routing which can be evaluated early in ship development, positively contributing to crew operations once a ship is constructed. Solving the rudimentary design concerns engine crew struggle with earlier in ship design will provide a better foundation for increasingly detailed development.

40|$|Architectural {{schematic}} drawings {{have been used}} to communicate building designs for centuries. The symbolic language used in these drawings efficiently represents much of the intricacy of the building process (e. g. implied business relationships, common building practice, and properties of construction materials). The drawing language is an accepted standard representation for building design, something that modern data languages have failed to achieve. In fact, the lack of an accepted standard electronic representation has hampered efforts at computer intergration and perhaps worsened industry fragmentation. In <b>general,</b> <b>drawings</b> must be interpreted, by a professional, and then reentered in order to transfer them from one CAD system to another. This work develops a method for machine interpretation of architectural (or other) {{schematic drawings}}. The central problem is to build an efficient drawing parser (i. e. a program that identifies the semantic entitites, characteristics, and relationships that are represented in the drawing). The parser is built from specifications of the drawing grammar and an underlying spatial model. The grammar describes what to look for, and the spatial model enables the parser to find it quickly. Coupled with existing optical recognition technology, this technique enables the use of drawings directly as: (1) a database to drive various AEC applications, (2) a communication protocol to integrate CAD systems, (3) a traditional user interface. ...|$|E

40|$|Reproduced with kind {{permission}} of the publisher. Â© by the Regents of the University of California. Available on Caliber ([URL] and AnthroSource ([URL] Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707 - 1778) is reputed to have transformed botanical practice by shunning the process of illustrating plants and relying on the primacy of literary descriptions of plant specimens. Botanists and historians have long debated Linnaeus's capacities as a draftsman. While some of his detailed sketches of plants and insects reveal a sure hand, his more <b>general</b> <b>drawings</b> of landscapes and people seem ill-executed. The overwhelming consensus, based mostly on his Lapland diary (1732), is that Linnaeus could not draw. Little has been said, however, {{on the role of}} drawing and other visual representations in Linnaeus's daily work as seen in his other numerous manuscripts. These manuscripts, held mostly at the Linnean Society of London, are peppered with sketches, maps, tables, and diagrams. Reassessing these manuscripts, along with the printed works that also contain illustrations of plant species, shows that Linnaeus's thinking was profoundly visual and that he routinely used visual representational devices in his various publications. This paper aims to explore the full range of visual representations Linnaeus used through his working life, and to reevaluate the epistemological value of visualization in the making of natural knowledge. By analyzing Linnaeus's use of drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, I will show that he did not, as has been asserted, reduce the discipline of botany to text, and that his visual thinking played a fundamental role in his construction of new systems of classification...|$|E

A motor module serves to handle motors. 10 sensors, including their signal conditionings, are introduced to read the environment conditions of the equipment. LEDs are used to display these conditions. In order to facilitate the operators 2 ̆ 7 duty, communication via RS 232 is provided. The brachytherapy equipment can therefore be operated by using computer. Interface software is developed using C# language.

An interlock system is introduced to guard against abnormal conditions. In the worst case, a manual intervention by the operator is provided when all other means are failing to store the isotope source into the safe container. The tests showed good results.

40|$|This Thesis {{contributes}} {{with new}} algorithms for line drawing interpretation. A line drawing is a 2 D diagram of vertices and straight edges aiming to depict a polyhedral 3 D scene. Given one such drawing we usually want to first test {{whether it is}} a correct projection. If it is, then we wish to reconstruct all possible scenes it can depict. Otherwise, we attempt to correct the drawing so that it becomes reconstractable. Traditionally, the Machine Vision approach to these problems has been mainly algebraic. Although computer scientists have discovered graphical techniques like the reciprocal diagrams, these have not been fully exploited or sometimes left apart, arguing that they only provide necessary conditions for realizability. However, a careful investigation of related areas of Geometry reveals the existence of complete and purely geometric tools that, using just pencil and straightedge, are able to decide the correctness of certain families of drawings. A first goal of this Thesis has been to select one such tool, the so-called cross-section diagram, and extend its validity to a broader class of drawings; namely, those of polyhedral surfaces generated by scenes of opaque polyhedra. At present, however, no general realizability test using pencil and straightedge alone has been devised for <b>general</b> <b>drawings</b> so that relying on algebraic methods seems unavoidable. A second goal of the Thesis has been to exploit a known mapping between spatial polyhedra and the instantaneous motions of an articulated mechanism. Based on this mapping, we give a concise realizability test that outperforms the most popular algebraic approach known so far, due to Sugihara: it is faster, numerically stable, straightforwardly implementable in floating-point arithmetic and yields a linear parameterization of all possible reconstructions of the drawing. Additionally, this gives a model of the Necker reversal phenomenon and, in some cases, it allows obtaining all concavity/convexity patterns of the edges, neither resorting to consistent labelling techniques, nor consulting junction dictionaries. A correction module is usually necessary, since drawings with a general geometry are seldom correct. In practice, for example, if a drawing is got from a hand-made sketch or by filtering a real image, the coordinates of its vertices will seldom lie in the right places, and reconstruction will not be possible. The third goal of the Thesis has been to efficiently solve this problem. To this end, we have devised the first algorithm for line drawing correction that allows the simultaneous movement of all the vertices. This yields better solutions than existing approaches, which only allowed the displacement of a subset of the vertices, or failed to correct some combinatorial structures. Moreover, we have provided a second correction strategy that keeps the vertices fixed but alters the combinatorial structure. The developed techniques find applications in the design of new man-machine interfaces for solid modeling, since they allow the reconstruction of 3 D shapes from rough hand-made sketches.
