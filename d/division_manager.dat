5|$|In {{his second}} season as manager, 2000–01, Adams guided Brighton to {{promotion}} as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league's basement division. A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary, as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities, leaving Brighton ten points clear at the season's end. He was named as Third <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the season for a second time, also picking up the Third <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Month award in September 2000.|$|E
5|$|A disappointing opening {{sequence}} of the 1980–81 season was followed by six wins in six games in September, and Bremner won his second Manager of the Month award. The good results continued {{for the rest of}} the campaign, and Rovers were promoted in third place. He signed Celtic's Colin Douglas for the challenge of Third Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed to win in the league. Results again picked up with only two defeats in the last 14 games, and they ended the campaign in 19th spot, three points above the relegation zone.|$|E
5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First <b>Division.</b> <b>Manager</b> Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Do multi-divisional firms {{structure}} compensation {{contracts for}} <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> to mitigate information and incentive {{problems in their}} internal capital markets? Using Compustat Segment financial data and compensation data from a proprietary survey, I find evidence that compensation and investment incentives are substitutes: firms providing a stronger link to firm performance in incentive compensation for <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> also provide weaker investment incentives through the capital budgeting process. Specifically, as the proportion of incentive pay for <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> {{that is based on}} firm performance increases, division investment is less responsive to division profitability. While these findings may be consistent with other explanations, they are generally consistent with a model of influence activities by <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> and the implied relative weights placed on imperfect, objective signals (i. e. accounting measures) versus distortable, subjective signals (i. e. manager recommendations) in inter-divisional capital allocation decisions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{decentralized}} capital budgeting problems when decision objectives {{are not necessarily}} identical with those of corporate headquarters. This paper extends previous analysis of this problem to the case where (i) the cash flows resulting from managerial actions are uncertain, (ii) <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> have nonlinear utility functions which {{differ from those of}} top management with respect to risk aversion and (iii) resource constraints may be nonlinear. Several realistic considerations arise in this context which were absent in previous analyses. First, because the division managers' utility functions reflect differing attitudes toward risk, top management has the opportunity to share some business risk with the <b>division</b> <b>managers.</b> We recommend a transfer pricing scheme that accounts for this possibility. Second, if the transfer prices for capital resources are state-dependent and the <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> make their investment decisions before the state of nature is revealed, the <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> will want to hedge against the additional uncertainty caused by this aspect of the problem. Despite the static nature of the analysis this paper raises the interesting problem of information flow within the firm and suggests ways to motivate <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> to act {{in the best interest of}} the firm. The transfer pricing algorithm has additional interesting applications. finance: capital budgeting, finance: management...|$|R
40|$|I {{show that}} {{performance}} incentives vary by decision-making authority of <b>division</b> <b>managers.</b> For <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> with broader authority, i. e., those designated as corporate officers, both {{the sensitivity of}} pay to global performance measures and {{the relative importance of}} global to local measures are larger, relative to non-officers. There is no difference in sensitivity of pay to local measures by officer status. These results support theories suggesting that authority over project selection combined with incentives designed to maximize firm performance, as well as induce effort for the division, are important in incentive design for <b>division</b> <b>managers.</b> Consistent with earlier findings, the evidence strongly supports one of the main predictions of the principal-agent model, that is, a negative tradeoff between risk and incentives.

5|$|Before 1997 was out, Adams {{took his}} third {{job of the}} 1997–98 season when he was named manager of Brentford. The club had {{suffered}} a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two play-off final, and were struggling near {{the foot of the}} table. He signed striker Andy Scott from Sheffield United for a fee of £75,000, as well as signing Glenn Cockerill as player/assistant manager, Warren Aspinall and loanee Nigel Gleghorn. However injuries began to mount, with Ijah Anderson, Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina all sidelined. Adams was named as Second <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Month for March after overseeing three wins and two draws. Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were relegated to Division Three {{on the last day of}} the season, and the club was bought out by Ron Noades, who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{signed a}} new three-year {{contract}} in summer 1987. New arrivals {{at the club}} were Glynn Snodin (£150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (£230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (£350,000 from Derby County), as well as Jim Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987–88 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy {{a good relationship with}} the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988–89 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds went on to win promotion in 1990.|$|E
5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model that shows how {{rent-seeking}} behavior {{on the part of}} <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> can subvert the workings of an internal capital market. In an effort to stop rent-seeking, corporate headquarters will be effectively forced into paying bribes to some <b>division</b> <b>managers.</b> And because headquarters is itself an agent of outside investors, the bribes may take the form not of cash, but rather of preferential capital budgeting allocations. One interesting feature of our model is a kind of socialism' in internal capital allocation, whereby weaker divisions tend to get subsidized by stronger ones. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{earnings}} manipulation on incentives within the corporate hierarchy. <b>Division</b> <b>managers</b> have to be compensated for not blowing the whistle when top managers manipulate earnings. We show that {{it is easier for}} <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> to prove top management’s manipulations when the performance of their own division is low. Earnings manipulation therefore undermines middle managers’ incentives to exert effort and destroys value. We show that earnings manipulation is more likely to occur in flatter hierarchies. We also discuss implications of our model as regards the Sarbanes Oxley Act regulations on auditing and the protection of whistle-blowers...|$|R

Wrexham had a good start to the season and Smith won the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 after a {{sequence}} of four wins and two draws. A slump followed but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee Trundle formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham {{dropped out of the}} play-off places following a sequence of draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of a sequence of eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 6–1 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important £100,000 in prize money. Smith was named as the Manager of the Month for April and 2003, before winning the League Managers Association's Third <b>Division</b> <b>Manager</b> of the Season award.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the agency cost of winner-picking in multidivision firms and uses explicit incentive contracts {{to analyze the}} interaction between corporate headquarters' investment and incentive policies.

40|$|In large {{organizations}} one {{can often}} find middle managers at several different levels within a company. Middle managers regularly experience their positions {{as complicated as}} they have both superiors as well as subordinates’ to please. We have chosen to refer to this problem as “the middle-management dilemma”. This problem has been well researched over the years; however the theories differ in many ways. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} dissertation has been to find out to what degree “the middle-management dilemma” exists among the <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> at the local tax office (Skattekontoret) in Örebro. We have also chosen to look closer at how some factors actually affect this dilemma. The factors we have selected are; the organization’s hierarchy, the company’s way of spreading information, communication- and relation abilities within the divisions as well as between the different divisions. To research this problem we have chosen to use a single-case study using semi-structured interviews. We have conducted interviews with two <b>division</b> <b>managers,</b> two employees, and an interview {{with the head of the}} tax office in Örebro. The findings we have been able to conclude are; all respondents agreed that “the middle management dilemma” does exist at the tax office in Örebro. The <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> did not consider it a major problem; however the employees did on the other hand. The company’s hierarchy also has an effect on “the dilemma” as it is the division managers’ obligation to reach the targets set by the organization’s top-level management. This constrains the <b>division</b> <b>managers</b> from making many decisions on their own. The structure of the organization also effects the spreading of the information, however the information flow is considered satisfactory by the employees in many ways. The three main ways used to spread information are through meetings, “the cascade model” and via the company’s Intranet. Communication- and relation abilities within- and between divisions work well too, this could be considered a sign that the organization takes the contentment of their employees seriously...|$|R
