5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be <b>grafted</b> <b>with</b> molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Human {{amniotic fluid}} {{comprises}} cells with high differentiation capacity, thus representing a potential cell source for skin tissue engineering. In this experimental study, we investigated {{the ability of}} human amniotic fluid derived cells to substitute dermal fibroblasts and support epidermis formation and stratification in a humanized animal model. METHODS: Dermo-epidermal skin <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> either amniocytes or with fibroblasts in the dermis were compared in a rat model. Full-thickness skin wounds {{on the back of}} immuno-incompetent rats were covered <b>with</b> skin <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> (1) amniocytes in the dermis, (2) fibroblasts in the dermis, or, (3) acellular dermis. Grafts were excised 7 and 21  days post transplantation. Histology and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate epidermis formation, stratification, and expression of established skin markers. RESULTS: The epidermis of skin <b>grafts</b> engineered <b>with</b> amniocytes showed near-normal anatomy, a continuous basal lamina, and a stratum corneum. Expression patterns for keratin 15, keratin 16, and Ki 67 were similar to <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> fibroblasts; keratin 1 expression was not yet fully established in all suprabasal cell layers, expression of keratin 19 was increased and not only restricted to the basal cell layer as seen in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> fibroblasts. In <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> acellular dermis, keratinocytes did not survive. CONCLUSION: Dermo-epidermal skin <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> amniocytes show near-normal physiological behavior suggesting that amniocytes substitute fibroblast function to support the essential cross-talk between mesenchyme and epithelia needed for epidermal stratification. This novel finding has considerable implications regarding tissue engineering...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Renal {{transplantation}} {{with multiple}} arteries appears, in literature, associated {{to a major}} index of surgical complications. This study compared the surgical complications and short-term outcome renal transplants with multiple arteries and single artery grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 64 renal transplants with multiple arteries performed between January 1995 and December 1999 were compared to the ones of 292 transplants with single renal artery. The aspects analyzed were number of arteries of the graft, donor type, vascular reconstruction technique, the occurrence of surgical complications, the incidence of delayed graft function, graft function 1 month after transplantation, graft loss and the patients' deaths. RESULTS: The incidence of surgical complications in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> multiple arteries and single renal artery was respectively: vascular - 3. 1 % and 3. 1 %; urological - 6. 3 % and 2. 7 % and other surgical complications - 15. 6 % and 10. 6 %, respectively. The incidence of lymphoceles was 3. 1 % in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> a single artery and 12. 5 % in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> more than 1 artery (p = 0. 0015). The incidence of delayed graft function in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> multiple arteries and with a single renal artery was respectively 35. 1 and 29. 1 % (p = 0. 295). Mean serum creatinine at the 30 th postoperative day was 2. 46 and 1. 81 in <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> multiple and with 1 artery, respectively (p= 0. 271).

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract We have previously grafted human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) with blood plasma to treat rat tibia nonunion. To further examine the biological characteristics of this process, we applied an established hUC-MSCs-treated rat nonunion model {{with the addition}} of an inhibitor of AKT. SD rats (80) were randomly divided into four groups: a fracture group (positive control); a nonunion group (negative con-trol); a hUC-MSCs <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma group; and a hUC-MSCs <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma & AKT blocker group. The animals were sacrificed under deep anesthesia at 4 and 8 weeks post fracture for analysis. The fracture line became less defined at 4 weeks and disappeared at 8 weeks postoperatively in both the hUC-MSCs <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma and <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma & the AKT blocker, which is similar to the fracture group. His-tological immunofluorescence studies showed that the numbers of hUC-MSCs in the calluses were significantly higher in the hUC-MSCs <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma than those in group with the AKT blocker. More bone mor-phogenetic protein 2 and bone sialoprotein expression and less osteoprotegerin and bone gla protein expression were observed in the AKT blocker group compared to the hUC-MSCs <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> blood plasma. AKT gene expression in the AKT blocker group was decreased 50 % compared to the hUC-MSCs with plasma group and decreased 70 % compared to the fracture group, while the elastic modulus was decreased.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAtheromatous aortic {{disease is}} {{a risk factor for}} {{excessive}} mortality and stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Outcomes of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with severe atheromatous aortic disease were compared by propensity case-match methods. MethodsRoutine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography identified 985 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> severe atheromatous disease in the aortic arch or ascending aorta. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 281 patients (28. 5 %). Propensity matched-pairs analysis was used to match patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 245) with patients undergoing coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass. ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed decreased hospital mortality (16 / 245, 6. 5 % vs 28 / 245, 11. 4 %; P =. 058) and stroke prevalence (4 / 245, 1. 6 % vs 14 / 245, 5. 7 %; P =. 03) in off-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> compared <b>with</b> coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass. Freedom from any postoperative complication was higher in off-pump coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> compared <b>with</b> coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass (226 / 245, 92. 2 % vs 196 / 245, 80. 0 %; P <. 001). Multivariable analysis of preoperative risk factors showed that increased hospital mortality was associated with coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass (odds ratio = 2. 7; P =. 01), fewer grafts (P =. 05), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 11. 5; P <. 001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio = 2. 4; P =. 03), previous cardiac surgery (odds ratio = 10. 2, P =. 05), and peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio = 2. 1; P =. 05). Cardiopulmonary bypass was the only independent risk factor for stroke (odds ratio = 3. 6, P =. 03). At 36 months' follow-up, comparable survival was observed in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass groups (74 % vs 72 %). Multivariable analysis revealed that renal disease (P <. 001), advanced age (P <. 001), previous myocardial infarction (P =. 03), and lower number of grafts (P =. 02) were independent risks for late mortality. ConclusionsPatients with severe atherosclerotic aortic disease who undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting have a significantly lower prevalence of hospital mortality, perioperative stroke, and overall complications than matched patients who underwent coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> cardiopulmonary bypass.

60|$|The {{foregoing}} {{rules and}} facts, {{on the other}} hand, appear to me clearly {{to indicate that the}} sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their reproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species, the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species and varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably, be <b>grafted</b> <b>with</b> ease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which {{is a member of the}} same genus.

MethodsWe reviewed 334 patients who underwent multivessel coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> <b>with</b> the free RITA between September 2004 and December 2010. The free RITA was used for individual grafting in 179 patients and for sequential grafting in 155 patients. We compared operative and postoperative variables and early and follow-up angiographic patency rates of distal anastomoses of the free RITA between the groups. ResultsThe mean number of distal anastomoses in sequential grafting was 2. 2 ± 0. 4. The inflow of the free RITA included the aorta (27. 4 %) and other grafts (72. 6 %) in the individual group. The inflow of free RITA was exclusively other grafts in the sequential group. Operative mortality and incidence of postoperative complications {{were not significantly different}} between groups. Overall patency rate of distal anastomosis of the free RITA was 99. 1 % at early angiography and 91. 8 % at follow-up angiography, and the rate did not differ significantly between individual and sequential grafting (early, 98. 6 % vs 99. 3 %; follow-up, 93. 0 % vs 91. 2 %).

Methods We reviewed the records of 225 adult kidney transplants done consecutively at our institution. Twenty-nine patients (12. 8 %) had <b>grafts</b> <b>with</b> multiple renal arteries. We analyzed the incidence of post-transplant hypertension and vascular complications, mean creatinine levels, patient and graft survival. In 17 cases reconstruction was done as conjoined anastomosis between two arteries of equal size, and in 6 cases as end-to-side anastomosis of smaller arteries to larger arteries. Multiple anastomoses were performed in 6 cases. Results In one patient postoperative bleeding occurred. Mean systolic blood pressures, creatinine levels at first year and last follow-up and complication rates were all in acceptable ranges. There was no significant difference in graft and patient survival between multiple and single renal artery allografts.
