While the United States ’ WTO complaints against China tend to challenge Chinese industrial policy, cases involving anti-dumping and countervailing duties dominate China’s WTO disputes against the United States. In addition, the significant expansion of bilateral trade relations in the past decades has provided opportunities for Chinese leaders to identify or to threaten retaliation against anti-protectionist groups in the United States in order to mobilize them against the <b>disputed</b> <b>measure.</b> Overall, United States–China trade disputes under the WTO increasingly reflect a distinctive political logic whereby domestic political considera-tions not only figure prominently {{in the decision to}} launch WTO dis-putes, but also frequently influence the way the dispute is played out either within or outside of the WTO framework...|$|E

The Repression of ‘ Activism’ in the Belgian Civil Service (1918 - 1921) During the First World War, radical Flemish nationalists or ‘activists’ collaborated with Germany {{in order to obtain}} Flemish self-rule or even independence. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the Belgian government prosecuted those who participated in the German Flamenpolitik. The repression of activism has led to many controversies, as the Flemish Movement considered it a harsh, anti-Flemish purge. Little is known about the repression of activists in the Belgian civil service. Yet, the scission of the Belgian civil service in a separate Flemish and Walloon branch was the most <b>disputed</b> <b>measure</b> of the German authorities and many civil servants were involved in one way or another. As it turned out, the administrative post-war purge was much larger than the criminal prosecution of activism. However, it would be a biased judgment to dismiss the administrative purge as an anti-Flemish operation as Walloon civil servants who had collaborated were also prosecuted. The repression of activism’was, however, burdened by the deficiencies typical of transitional justice: inadequate legal or administrative procedures, political interference, and infringements of the principles of a fair trial. <br /...|$|E

According to a comparative economic analysis of illegal behavior, we expect a relatively smaller deterrent effect of CCTV on terrorism than on other forms of crime. On the one hand, terrorists can switch to numerous alternative targets not monitored by cameras. On the other hand, CCTV images raise the degree of publicity terrorists can achieve. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies in {{international}} relations frequently use fixed measurements {{over the course of}} observations that are too aggregated for appropriately testing our theories. Such is the case with testing how the balance of power affects conflict escalation. Although power balances have been examined as a cause of war {{perhaps more than any other}} factor {{in international}} relations, studies of the balance of power all use static measurements of power which remain fixed over the course of a conflict (typically, the militarized dispute). Since we do not measure the dynamics of the balance of power, we still do not understand how the balance of power affects dispute escalation. To properly evaluate how the balance and changes in it lead to dispute escalation or de-escalation, we must apply a statistical model which allows time-varying covariates over the course of a <b>dispute.</b> Once <b>measured</b> properly and assessed in a competing risks hazard model, the balance of power does appear to affect dispute escalation, with a preponderance of power in favor of one side leading to longer disputes, but also disputes that are ultimately more likely to end in peace than war. The method applied here to balance of power can be applied more broadly to a class of similar problems where variable values change over time within what is nominally our unit of analysis...|$|R
40|$|Under what {{conditions}} does international trade have pacifying or exacerbating effects on militarized interstate conflict? Previous scholars have asserted that rational, aggregate welfare-maximizing leaders will promote {{free trade and}} refrain from actions, such as militarized interstate conflict, harmful to international trade. Assuming, however, that all leaders are motivated to serve aggregate interests leaves out potentially important domestic political-institutional characteristics that may produce different motivations across leaders. Drawing upon the work of early political economists, the author presents a theory integrating the effects of economically important trade and domestic political institutions on the likelihood of militarized interstate <b>disputes.</b> Using <b>measures</b> of the selectorate, winning coalition, participation, and competition, the hypotheses derived from this theory are tested for {{all members of the}} interstate system from 1885 [...] 1992. The findings suggest that domestic political institutions do condition the effect of international trade on militarized interstate conflict. As a greater percentage of the citizenry are involved in the leadership selection process, economically important trade reduces the likelihood of militarized conflict. Similarly, as the size of the leader's supporting constituency increases, again involving a greater percentage of the citizenry, trade reduces the likelihood of conflict. At low levels of citizen involvement in leadership selection [...] -and for leaders with smaller supporting constituencies [...] -international trade does not reduce the likelihood of interstate conflict and may actually increase the likelihood of such conflict...|$|R

50|$|As {{against this}} {{enforcement}} model, Chayes proposed an alternative managerial model of compliance, {{relying on a}} problem-solving, cooperative approach instead of a coercive one. He suggests an array of activities to ensure compliance. First, Chayes highlighted the need for transparency, including the development of data on performance through self-reporting and verification to check the reliability of reported data, both through state verification systems and, as a less formal and costly alternative, {{in the form of}} external checks from other states and nongovernmental scientific interest groups. Second, Chayes proposed informal <b>dispute</b> settlement <b>measures,</b> suggesting compulsory conciliation that would result in nonbinding recommendations. This would ensure that conciliation efforts would be able to address a broad range of disputes, while maintaining principles of sovereignty by not forcing parties to accept the decisions reached. Third, deficits in technical and bureaucratic capability and financial resources can be healed through treaty provisions that expressly provide for technical assistance to those states that are incapable of compliance due to these domestic handicaps. Fourth, Chayes combined the elements of transparency, dispute settlement, and capacity building into a broader process of “jawboning” - the effort to persuade the violator to change its ways. This can be accomplished through discourse among the parties, the treaty organization, and the international community. Chayes argued that in an international system that is increasingly interdependent, states no longer have the freedom to act independently, but instead must submit to the pressures of international regulation. He thereby cites Robert D. Putnam “The sanction for violating norms and expectations generated by this network is not penal, but exclusion from the network of solidarity and cooperation.” Throughout the book, Chayes stressed the importance of the international legal process in creating and sustaining regulatory treaties, noting how the need for improving compliance can be accomplished by cooperative problem-solving by international society.|$|R
