25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters {{by the time she was}} finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Chrissie Wellington <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> has two passions in life: {{sport and}} development.

She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together.

Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E
