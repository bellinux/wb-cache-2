50|$|Tetsubin (鉄瓶) are Japanese {{cast-iron}} kettles with a pouring spout, a lid, and {{a handle}} crossing over the top, used for boiling and <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water for drinking purposes, such as for making tea.|$|R
50|$|Peanut butter, {{which is}} very {{difficult}} to dislodge from the throat, may possibly be dissolved by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water down the throat—the method carries risk, but it may work on peanut butter as a last possible resort if nothing else first tried does.|$|R
60|$|The {{gardens are}} well kept, and produce {{quantities}} {{of fruit and}} vegetables. The chief food of the poorer class is bread or porridge of buckwheat, with cabbage soup, made by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water over cabbage leaves and adding a bit of butter.|$|R
60|$|The {{vessel was}} {{on the eve of}} departure. Her deck {{presented}} that scene of bustle and alacrity dear to the sailor's heart. Men were busy nailing up the masts, hanging the bowsprit over the side, varnishing the lee-scuppers and <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> tar down the companion-way.|$|R
50|$|Kape Barako is {{prepared}} using a drip brewing device, French press, or by simply <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water unto the grounds and filtering the mixture using {{a piece of}} cloth. Barako is best sweetened with honey or brown sugar. Barako {{can be used to}} make espresso and other espresso-based drinks.|$|R
50|$|In Poland, {{the holiday}} Andrzejki is celebrated {{on the night}} of the 29th through 30 November. Traditionally, the holiday was only {{observed}} by young single girls, though today both young men and women join the party to see their futures. The main ceremony involved <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> wax from a candle through the hole in a key into cold water.|$|R
30|$|Thermal {{performance}} of the textile materials under hot water was measured following {{a modified version of}} the ASTM F 2701 - 08 Standard Test method for evaluating heat transfer through materials for protective clothing upon contact with a hot liquid splash. The ASTM F 2701 - 08 method involved <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water on the textile material through a funnel for 10 s. However, manually <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water over the fabric was found to affect the repeatability and the flow rate of water (Jalbani et al. 2012). Hence, the test apparatus and the method described in Jalbani et al. (2012) was used which involved circulating hot water through a small pipe from the hot water bath. In this method, the flow of hot water through the pipe could be adjusted by a valve and therefore a consistent flow rate and temperature could be maintained throughout the test.|$|R
2500|$|Mate is a drink {{popular in}} many parts of South America. Its {{preparation}} consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.|$|R
60|$|But Pelias {{still remembered}} to be courteous, and he bade his men lead the {{stranger}} to the baths, and there the attendants bathed him, <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water over him. And they anointed his head with oil, and clothed him in new raiment, and {{brought him back to}} the hall, and set him down at a table beside the king, and gave him meat and drink.|$|R
60|$|While he {{delivered}} himself {{of these words}} {{in a state of}} great commotion, John was constantly running backwards and forwards to and from the closet, bringing out all sorts of things in pots, scooping extraordinary quantities of tea out of the caddy, dropping French rolls into his boots, <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water over the butter, and making a variety of similar mistakes without disconcerting himself in the least.|$|R
50|$|The film follows Papashvily {{from his}} arrival and initial {{immigrant}} inspection on Ellis Island, through his early jobs on New York's bustling Lower East Side. His friend, Nuri (Kurt Kasznar), {{who had arrived}} in New York earlier and speaks English, leads the way, telling Giorgi that he'll help him get an outdoor job with plenty of fresh air. Instead, they find themselves carrying buckets and <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> tar on rooftops.|$|R
25|$|Tea is an {{aromatic}} beverage commonly {{prepared by}} <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> or boiling water over cured {{leaves of the}} Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water, {{it is the most}} widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.|$|R
5000|$|Portrayed by Rolf Skoglund. Gammelman (name meaning [...] "old man") is the (somewhat senile) elder of the Midgard village, {{he is an}} Aesir Gothi aged around 100. He is sexually kinky {{and often}} refers to the gods' sexual parts when {{he is talking about}} them. He uses unrecommended methods to heal people, such as <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water in the anus of the king when he has toothache. He often intends to {{sacrifice}} the monk Peter Nicolaus.|$|R
40|$|Hot water {{epilepsy}} {{is a form of}} reflex epilepsy in childhood. We report {{two children}} from Saudi Arabia, who presented with seizures following <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water on their head, while bathing. They were not treated by anti-epileptic medication. By decreasing the temperature of the water used for bathing, the seizures were avoided to a large extent in them. This form of epilepsy is reported to be seldom present in various countries but there are no records of its presence in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
50|$|In China, chili oil is {{prepared}} basically by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> vegetable oil slowly on chili pepper powder or chopped chili pepper. Many other ingredients {{can be added}} alongside to enrich flavor such as Chinese black vinegar, minced garlic, dried ginger skin, sesame seeds, sesame oil, Sichuan peppercorn, cinnamon, star anise and bay leaf. There are also many derivative condiments from chili oil, {{one of which is}} Lao Gan Ma that is produced from chili oil and Douchi (豆豉, fermented black soybeans).|$|R
5000|$|The process {{involved}} <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> pitch, or tar (mainly used at {{the time}} for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper [...] "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head, allowed to cool, then rapidly removed, taking with it {{a portion of the}} suspect's skin and tissue. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by Myles Byrne* https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala_djvu.txt in his memoirs.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the methods}} {{employed}} in early and primitive cultures were non-surgical. Physical activities like strenuous labor, climbing, paddling, weightlifting, or diving were a common technique. Others included the use of irritant leaves, fasting, bloodletting, <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water onto the abdomen, and lying on a heated coconut shell. In primitive cultures, techniques developed through observation, adaptation of obstetrical methods, and transculturation. Physical means of inducing abortion, including battery, exercise, and tightening the girdle were still often used {{as late as the}} Early Modern Period among English women.|$|R
2500|$|The {{enormous}} stone bridge {{constructed by}} Sultan Ghazi over the moat {{led to an}} imposing bent entrance complex. Would-be assailants to the castle {{would have to take}} over six turns up a vaulted entrance ramp, over which were machicolations for <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> liquids on attackers from the mezzanine above. Secret passageways wind through the complex, and the main passages are decorated with figurative reliefs. The Ayyubid block is topped by the Mamluk [...] "Throne Hall", a hall where Mamluk sultans entertained large audiences and held official functions.|$|R

50|$|On the roof, {{there is}} a 90 cm wide aisle behind the battlement. The merlons were {{designed}} suitable for <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> oil onto the enemy. To the northwest and northeast corners of the caravanserai, great importance is attached in regard of an attack coming from the sea. The merlons on the northeast corner are higher giving it an impression of a watchtower. The entablature is 10.60 m high at {{the inside of the}} structure while the building's height on the outside is 12.63 m.|$|R

50|$|During {{their first}} sexual encounter, Dulaney, {{overcome}} by lust, notices too late that Carlson is tying his arms {{behind his back}} using his own belt. Carlson pushes him onto the bed, removes his underwear, and while he is restrained, she humiliates him by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> candle wax on his chest, stomach, and genitals, amused by the frustration and increasingly desperate reactions she is eliciting from Dulaney. The two then have sex with Carlson in complete control, an obvious counterpoint to their relationship in the courtoom, where Dulaney is the one in control.|$|R
50|$|The Yazidis' {{concern with}} {{religious}} purity, and their reluctance to mix elements {{perceived to be}} incompatible, is shown in not only their caste system, but also various taboos affecting everyday life. The purity of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water is protected {{by a number of}} taboos, e.g. against spitting on earth, water or fire. Some discourage spitting or <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water on the ground because they believe that spirits or souls that may be present would be harmed or offended by such actions if they happen to be hit by the discarded liquid.|$|R
50|$|Brewed {{coffee is}} made by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water onto ground coffee beans, then {{allowing}} to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, or simply ground coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its oils and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through {{the bottom of the}} filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter with the liquid falling (dripping) into a collecting vessel such as a carafe or pot.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} method of instructing a {{sequential}} task to a household robot using a hand-held augmented reality device. The user decomposes a high-level goal such as “prepare a drink ” into steps such as delivering a mug under a kettle and <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water into the mug. The user takes a photograph of each step using the device and annotates it with necessary information via touch operation. The resulting sequence of annotated photographs serves as a reference for review and reuse at a later time. We created a working prototype system with various types of robots and appliances. I...|$|R
5000|$|Chili oil, La jiao You or hong you (辣椒油, 红油), {{is another}} {{distinctive}} Sichuan flavoring found mainly in cold dishes, {{as well as}} a few hot dishes. Chili oil is made by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> oil onto a bowl of dried chilies, to which some Sichuan pepper is usually added. After steeping in hot oil for at least a few hours, the oil takes on the taste and fragrance of chili. The finer the chili is ground, the stronger the flavor (regional preferences vary - ground chili is usually used in western China, while whole dried chili is more common in northern China.) ...|$|R
25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} head bolt heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved head bolt heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|R
500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation. [...] Anne Greene, a woman {{sentenced to death}} and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. [...] They revived her by <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> cordial down her throat, rubbing her limbs and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating plasters and a [...] "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." [...] After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned.|$|R
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Eton from 1802 until 1803, {{when he was}} expelled. Thereafter he studied at Brighton (1803-04), where his {{behaviour}} was little improved. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1805. The combination of his absolute avoidance of academic work (even {{by the standards of}} the day) and his rowdy behaviour (including incidents such as <b>pouring</b> <b>hot</b> gravy over the head of a fellow student he disliked during hall) meant that he narrowly avoided being sent down. Ultimately, he left Oxford without a degree in 1807. On the other hand, during his student days he excelled in all sports, setting a pattern for the rest of his life.|$|R
