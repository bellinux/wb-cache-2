5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown <b>Daubentoniidae</b> is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including <b>Daubentoniidae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: <b>Daubentoniidae,</b> Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|Within Strepsirrhini, {{two common}} classifications include either two infraorders (Adapiformes and Lemuriformes) or three infraorders (Adapiformes, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes). A less common {{taxonomy}} places the aye-aye (<b>Daubentoniidae)</b> {{in its own}} infraorder, Chiromyiformes. In some cases, plesiadapiforms are included within the order Primates, in which case Euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder, with Strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder, and the Lemuriformes and others become parvorders. Regardless of the infraordinal taxonomy, Strepsirrhini is composed of three ranked superfamilies and 14families, seven of which are extinct. Three of these extinct families included the recently extinct giant lemurs of Madagascar, many of which died out within the last 1,000years following human arrival on the island.|$|E
500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{classification}} of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the {{dwarf and mouse lemurs}} with the galagos. In 1915, William King Gregory published a classification that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a [...] "series" [...] Lemuriformes and recognized three families: <b>Daubentoniidae,</b> Indriidae, and Lemuridae (including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae). George Gaylord Simpson's influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the treeshrews and the fossil Anagale (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families Plesiadapidae and Adapidae in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that <b>Daubentoniidae</b> (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits create a lot of noise for molecular techniques.|$|E
500|$|Determining the {{phylogeny}} of subfossil lemurs {{has been}} problematic because studies of morphology, developmental biology, and molecular phylogenetics have sometimes yielded conflicting results. All studies {{agree that the}} family <b>Daubentoniidae</b> (including the giant aye-aye) diverged first from the other lemurs at least 60million years ago. The relationship between the remaining families has been less clear. [...] Morphological, developmental, and molecular studies have offered support for lumping the four sloth lemur genera of the family Palaeopropithecidae with the family Indriidae (including the indri, sifakas, and woolly lemurs).

[...] Molecular data, instead, indicate a closer relationship to family Lemuridae. [...] Likewise, a relationship between family Archaeolemuridae and family Lemuridae has been suggested, based on morphological and developmental traits, yet molar morphology, the number of teeth in the specialized toothcomb, and molecular analysis support a closer relationship with the indriid–sloth lemur clade.

40|$|LEMURS (INFRAORDER: Lemuriformes) are a {{radiation}} of strepsirrhine primates {{endemic to}} the island of Madagascar. As of 2012, 101 lemur species, divided among five families, have been described. Genetic and morphological evidence indicates all species are descended from a common ancestor that arrived in Madagascar ∼ 55 - 60 million years ago (mya). Phylogenetic relationships in this species-rich infraorder {{have been the subject}} of debate. Here we use Alu elements, a family of primate-specific Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs), to construct a phylogeny of infraorder Lemuriformes. Alu elements are particularly useful SINEs for the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction because they are identical by descent and confounding events between loci are easily resolved by sequencing. The genome of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) was computationally assayed for synapomorphic Alu elements. Those that were identified as Lemuriformes-specific were analyzed against other available primate genomes for orthologous sequence in which to design primers for PCR (polymerase chain reaction) verification. A primate phylogenetic panel of 24 species, including 22 lemur species from all five families, was examined for the presence/absence of 138 Alu elements via PCR to establish relationships among species. Of these, 111 were phylogenetically informative. A phylogenetic tree was generated based on the results of this analysis. We demonstrate strong support for the monophyly of Lemuriformes to the exclusion of other primates, with <b>Daubentoniidae,</b> the aye-aye, as the basal lineage within the infraorder. Our results also suggest Lepilemuridae as a sister lineage to Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae as sister to Lemuridae. Among the Cheirogaleidae, we show strong support for Microcebus and Mirza as sister genera, with Cheirogaleus the sister lineage to both. Our results also support the monophyly of the Lemuridae. Within Lemuridae we place Lemur and Hapalemur together to the exclusion of Eulemur and Varecia, with Varecia the sister lineage to the other three genera...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} cannot be understood from inspection of a single region, for each cell and fiber has discrete connections. Therefore, a study of the nervous system requires distinct approaches. One fundamental approach has been the study of comparative neuroanatomy. In a comparative study of the evolution of the primates and subsequently man, the investigator is confronted with a variety of animal forms. Each form represents an end product of a long vertical line of evolutionary development. The problem is to try to reconstruct the vertical line (ancestral forms) from the horizontal end products (extant forms). The order Primates has two suborders: (1) the Prosimii - composed of six families - Tupaiidae, Lemuridae, Indriidae, <b>Daubentoniidae,</b> Lorisidae, and Tarsiidae and (2) the Anthropoidea - also composed of six families including the Old and New World monkeys, the great apes and man. One group of the suborder Prosimii is the family Lorisidae. The living members of the family are represented by the lorises of India and Southeast Asia and the galagoes and pottos of Africa. Characters these animals share with the higher anthropoid primates are seen in the osteology of the middle ear and the medial wall of the orbit (Le Gros Clark, 1959). They also have orbits encircled by bone, three kinds of teeth, a well developed caecum, true nails and a pseudo-opposable thumb. In habit, these animals are omnivorous, nocturnal and arboreal. In progression, the lorisoids are less tied to the quadrupedalism of many lemurs (Osman Hill, 1953). The lorises have a slow deliberate mode of hand-over-hand locomotion, their limbs are subequal in length. In contrast, the galagos locomote by a rapid, saltatory behavior and have pelvic limbs much longer than pectoral limbs. Both of these means of progression effect an orthograde (erect or semi-erect) posture of the trunk and a tendency for a different mode of balancing the head on the spine. Some authors regard the vertical clinging and leaping of galagos as the earliest locomotor specialization of primates (Napier and Walker, 1967; Napier, 1967). From the post-cranial osteology of early Miocene Lorisidae (Walker, 1970) and from a comparative osteological, behavioral and paleontological study (Napier and Walker, 1967), it appears that this locomotor pattern was present in early Eocene and subsequent Miocene prosimians. These authors conclude that vertical clinging and leaping is the earliest known primate locomotor specialization and preadaptive to some or possibly all subsequent patterns of primate progression—quadrupedalism, brachiation and bipedalism. Although comparative neuroanatomical investigations have utilized the anthropoid primates, (mainly Macaca) rodents and carnivores (chiefly the cat), the prosimian primates have been relatively ignored. Yet their locomotor behavior and their propensity toward bipedalism make them an interesting model for a study of central nervous pathways related to locomotion...|$|E
