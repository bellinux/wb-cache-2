Running on a PC, STM Studio interfaces with STM 8 and STM 32 MCUs via standard development tools, such as the low cost ST-LINK and RLink along with the high-end STM 8 STice emulation system. STM Studio is a non-intrusive tool, preserving the real-time behavior of applications. STM Studio perfectly complements traditional debugging tools to fine tune applications. It is well suited for debugging applications which cannot be stopped, such as motor control applications. Different graphic views are available to match the needs of debugging and diagnosis or to demonstrate application behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{field survey}} examined {{the roles of}} mathematics anxiety, self-esteem, proactive coping, and test stress in mathematics achievement among 204 (151 females) randomly selected Year 8 - 10 Brunei secondary school students. The negative dimensions of mathematics anxiety, self-esteem, and proactive coping correlated negatively with mathematics achievement and were both poor predictors of and barriers to mathematics achievement. Both test stress components (intrusive and avoidance) also related negatively with mathematics grades and were poor predictors of mathematics achievement. In addition, females {{scored significantly higher on}} negative self-esteem and <b>intrusive</b> stress <b>variables</b> than males. Furthermore, mathematically less able students scored significantly higher on the negative mathematics anxiety and negative self-esteem domains than more able peers. Moreover, positive proactive coping was a good predictor of mathematics achievement. Overall, the findings have practical significance indicating psychological areas where attention, counselling efforts and educational interventions need to be directed to help the at-risk and vulnerable students...|$|R
30|$|The {{computed}} {{heat flow}} values {{for all the}} oil wells in the basin suggest that its sediments are thermally mature enough to generate hydrocarbons. Moreover, gravity and depth to basement map reveal good sediment thickness for formations in the basin. The fault-related structures identified from seismic data have steep gradient planes which may not seal and can thus be multidirectional pathways for petroleum migration which eventually disseminated in the formations. Ofoegbu (1985) {{in his study of}} the magnetic feature of the nearby Benue Trough, observed a magnetic anomaly on a dyke-like body. Such anomalies are best accounted for to a great extent by the presence of igneous <b>intrusive</b> bodies of <b>variable</b> depth and occurring within the basement of sedimentary rocks. These intrusive which must have extended to the Chad Basin have adverse effects on the preservation of petroleum within the basin.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{combined}} least squares and non-linear optimisation for {{the interpretation of}} magnetic anomalies over dykes is here presented. The method seeks to minimise a non-linear objective function by iteratively varying the non-linear parameters of the dyke while obtaining optimum values of the linear parameters by least squares analysis until an acceptable fit is obtained between the observed and computed anomalies. A study {{of the effects of}} demagnetization in arbitrarily shaped bodies and methods for evaluating the demagnetization effects of such bodies are also presented. Sixteen profiles have been taken across a linear magnetic feature which intersects the North Minch on the North Scottish Shelf. These have been interpreted in terms of a dyke about 1 km wide using the non-linear optimization techniques developed. The dyke is reversely magnetized in a direction consistent with its Tertiary origin. An aeromagnetic study of the Lower and Middle Benue Trough of Nigeria has been carried out. Regions of high and low magnetic anomalies have been correlated in an effort to find trends. Two-dimensional interpretation of several aeromagnetic profiles across the trough has been carried out. Interpretation of the observed anomalies in terms of topographic variations of the basement led to rather unreasonable models. The anomalies were best interpreted in terms of basic intrusive bodies which could occur either predominantly within the Cretaceous sediments or within the metamorphic basement. The model <b>intrusives</b> have <b>variable</b> thicknesses and directions of magnetization, suggesting that although derived from the same basic mantle material, the intrusions were emplaced at different polarity epochs. An attempt is also made to explain the tectonic evolution of the trough in terms of the models obtained...|$|R
40|$|The Hellyer, Fossey, Que River, and Mount Charter volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) {{deposits}} {{occur within}} the Que-Hellyer Volcanics of the Mount Read Volcanics in western Tasmania, Australia. The Mount Read Volcanics are a Middle to Late Cambrian, predominantly submarine succession of rhyolitic to basaltic volcanic and <b>intrusive</b> rocks with <b>variable</b> proportions of intercalated sedimentary rocks. The VHMS deposits occur along a 6 km north-northwest strike and are hosted {{within the same}} stratigraphic sequence. Following {{the discovery of the}} Fossey deposit in 2007, there was renewed interest in improving the current understanding of the geochemical features of the hydrothermal alteration zones around these VHMS systems. This thesis provides new geologic information on the Fossey and Mount Charter deposits and advances the overall understanding of the whole Que-Hellyer district. The compilation of a semi-continuous spread of regional and deposit-scale data over the 6 km strike length provides a unique opportunity to review the entire mineralising system and develop {{a better understanding of the}} alteration systematics using whole-rock geochemistry, alteration mineral chemistry and spectral analyses. The Hellyer deposit is a high grade polymetallic deposit with an irregular elongate shape, offset by the steep, north-south striking Jack Fault. It represents a well preserved example of a seafloor vent deposit with a focussed stringer system. Hellyer is the largest deposit of the four, with a pre-mining resource of 16. 5 Mt at 0. 4...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the geology of a Lower Palaeozoic terrain, situated {{west of the}} town of Fishguard, SW Dyfed, Wales. The area is dominated by the Fishguard Volcanic Complex (Upper Llanvirn), and sediments that range in age from the Middle Cambrian to the Lower Llandeilo. The successions represent an insight into sedimentation and volcanism for c. 100 Ma. along the south-western margin of the Lower Palaeozoic Welsh Basin. The stratigraphy of the sedimentary sequence has been completely revised and the existing volcanostratigraphy modified. The observed complexity of the stratigraphy is primarily the consequence of Caldedonide deformation which resulted in large scale repetition. Fold-thrust tectonics dominates the structural style of the area. Caledonide trending (NE-SW) cross-faults complicate preexisting structures. Middle Cambrian (?) sedimentation is documented by shallow marine clastics and red shales deposited within tidal - subtidal environments. Upper Cambrian sedimentation was dominated by shallow marine `storm' and `fair weather' sedimentation within a muddy shelf environment. Shallow marine conglomerates and heterolithic intertidal siliciclastics mark the onset of Ordovician sedimentation during the lower Arenig transgression. Mid-Arenig sediments reflect deposits influenced by storm, fair-weather and wave related processes in various shallow marine environments, including; shoreface, inner shelf, shoaling bar, and deltaic. Graptolitic marine shales were deposited from the upper mid-Arenig through to the lower Llandeilo; during which time sediments accumulated by pelagic processes and fine grained turbidites. The varied nature of sedimentation reflects both localised change within the depositional system and the influence of larger regional eustatic events. Ordovician subaqueous volcanic activity produced thick accumulations of lavas, pyroclastics, hydroclastics, and hyaloclastics. The majority of volcanism was effusive in nature, erupted below the Pressure Compensation Level. Basaltic volcanism was characterised by pillowed lavas and tube networks, whilst sheet-flow lavas, pillow breccias and minor hyaloclastites developed locally. Silicic volcanism was dominated by rhyolitic clastics of various affinities, although coherent silicic obsidian lavas, sheet-flow lavas and pyroclastics developed. Hypabyssal <b>intrusives</b> of <b>variable</b> composition and habit occur throughout the volcanic successions. Low-grade regional metamorphism has variably affected the area, conditions of the prehnite-pumpellyite and greenschist facies having been attained. Numerous secondary phases developed in response to the conditions imposed, which collectively indicate that P-T conditions were of low-pressure facies series in the range P= 1. 2 - 2. 0 kbars and T= 230 - 350 oC, under an elevated geothermal gradient of 40 - 45 oC km- 1. Polymineralic cataclastites associated with Caledonide deformation indicate that tectonism and metamorphism were in part contemporaneous...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePermian {{large-scale}} transcurrent tectonics {{and massive}} magmatism are prominent {{features of the}} Tianshan belt and neighboring regions of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Structural, geochronological and geochemical analyses of Carboniferous and Permian intrusive rocks associated with the Kangguer-Huangshan Shear Zone (eastern Chinese North Tianshan) provide constraints on their tectonic setting and the tectonic evolution of the Tianshan belt as well. Carboniferous granitic rocks were emplaced at 338 4 Ma and 347 2 Ma, respectively, and show geochemical features typical of the calc-alkaline series. These arc-type granites do not display ductile deformation, probably because they were completely cooled {{at the time of}} shearing tectonics, and are only offset by brittle strike-slip faults. In contrast, Permian granitoids display pervasive ductile tectonic features diagnostic of synkinematic emplacement. Four gabbro and diorite samples from the East Huangshan intrusive complex yielded zircon U-Pb ages of 267 to 275 Ma, and a granitic dike is dated at 290 1 Ma. The granitic dike is cut by en-echelon right-lateral strike-slip faults, and the mafic intrusive complex displays a sigmoidal shape with mylonitic foliation localized at its margins. Other specific pluton shapes (such as tongue and tadpole-like) and synmagmatic deformation can be observed in intrusions of the same age, showing similar fabrics and kinematics consistent with that of the Kangguer-Huangshan Shear Zone. Numerous mafic to felsic dikes occur within and off the shear zone with a dominant SE-NW orientation and minor varieties in N-S or NNE-SSW directions. One gabbro dike that intrudes the early Carboniferous granite of the East Kanggurtag area yielded a magmatic age of 274 4 Ma, and contains older zircons (340 Ma, 390 Ma, 450 Ma, and 1. 3 - 2. 2 Ga) probably inherited from intruded rocks. The Permian <b>intrusive</b> rocks have <b>variable</b> chemical compositions suggesting derivation of these rocks from depleted and undepleted (or enriched) mantle sources with involvement of subductionrelated components. We conclude from our integrated analysis of the geological, structural, geochemical and geochronological data that the Permian magmatic rocks were formed in a post-collisional/post-orogenic setting from multiple sources, and were emplaced under the control of large-scale dextral transcurrent tectonics...|$|R
40|$|The Curaca Valley of Bahia, Brazil, is a {{high-grade}} granulite facies granite gneiss terrane that hosts numerous sill-like mafic-ultramafic <b>intrusive</b> {{bodies of}} <b>variable</b> size. Of particular interest are the orthopyroxenites, which contain economically important Cu sulfides. The ore is generally interpreted {{to be of}} primary magmatic origin, {{mainly because of the}} almost exclusive association of the mineralization with the orthopyroxenites. However, the ore is highly atypical of magmatic deposits in that it contains up to 50 percent magnetite, the sulfide assemblage consists of bornite and chalcopyrite (yielding an average Cu/Ni ratio of 40), and the host orthopyroxenites contain abundant phlogopite, and locally, apatite and zircon. This has raised questions about an alternative mechanism of ore formation. In addition to Cu, Ni, and Se, we have determined noble metal contents in 90 samples from several bodies along a strike length of some 80 km, in order to constrain the ore-forming processes. Most orthopyroxenites contain between 100 and 500 ppb platinum-group elements, but individual samples may contain up to 2, 700 ppb. Mantle-normalized noble metal patterns are relatively fractionated, with Pd/Ir ratios of approximately 70. Hydrothermal Cu sulfide ores typically show much more pronounced noble metal fractionation, caused by the relatively high mobility in low-temperature fluids of Au, Pd, and Pt, compared to Os, Ir, Ru, and Rh. This supports an originally magmatic origin of the ore. To explain the high Cu/Ni and other unusual features of the Curaca Valley ores, we suggest that the orthopyroxenites may represent restitites of a sulfide-, magnetite-, phlogopite-, and apatite-bearing dioritic protolith which underwent anatexis and effective melt extraction. The sulfides may have been molten but could have remained in the restite due to their relatively high density. Partial dissolution of the sulfide melt by the S-undersaturated silicate melt would cause enrichment of the excess sulfide melt in the highly chalcophile Cu and Se, potentially followed by the crystallization of bornite and chalcopyrite. This interpretation is supported by the absence of differentiated lithologies that may represent residual liquids and {{by the fact that the}} Curaca Valley deposits as well as the Okiep deposits and several other minor Cu sulfide ores described from elsewhere are located in high-grade metamorphic terranes...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Long-term psychosocial {{consequences}} {{of breast cancer}} are increasingly more important to study as survivors are living longer. However, the survivors do not experience cancer alone; their significant others often suffer just as much if not more than the survivors themselves. In this dissertation, we explore some long-term {{consequences of}} cancer {{within the context of}} the Social Cognitive Processing Theory (SCPT). SCPT proposes that an individual must be able to discuss their feelings in order to cognitively process a traumatic event, such as cancer. If discussions are hindered, in particular by a significant other, then one will be unable to work through his/her concerns, leading to poor psychological outcomes, such as depression and fear of recurrence. The purpose of this dissertation is to use SCPT to identify causal mechanisms of depressive symptoms and fear of recurrence using a large sample of young breast cancer survivors and their partners. For one paper, we also included a large set of older participants for comparison. This dissertation is divided into three distinct articles. Each article tests long-term consequences of breast cancer and its treatment on breast cancer survivors and their partners using SCPT to explain relationships. First we examine the hypothesized predictors of younger breast cancer survivors’ depressive symptoms including the partner variable of depressive symptoms. The second article addresses the partners by predicting their depressive symptoms using SCPT. The third and final article seeks to identify the relationship of predictors and FOR on both survivors and their partners again using SCPT. For survivors, structural equation modeling analyses found significant direct and indirect paths between depressive symptoms and theoretical variables, including social constraints (stb=. 266, p<. 001) and intrusive thoughts (stb=. 453, p<. 001). In partners, cognitive processing <b>variables</b> (<b>intrusive</b> thoughts and cognitive avoidance) mediated the relationship between social constraints and depressive symptoms (F(5, 498) = 19. 385, R 2 =. 163, p<. 001). And finally, cognitive processing mediated the relationship between social constraints and fear of recurrence both for survivors [F(3, 213) = 47. 541, R 2 =. 401, p<. 001] and partners [F(3, 215) = 27. 917, R 2 =. 280, p<. 001). The evidence from these studies supports the use of SCPT in predicting depressive symptoms and fear of recurrence in both long-term survivors and partners...|$|R
