40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the size and strength of convective updraughts in high-resolution simulations by the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). Updraught velocities have been estimated from range–height indicator (RHI) Doppler velocity measurements using the Chilbolton advanced meteorological radar, as part of the Dynamical and Microphysical Evolution of Convective Storms (DYMECS) project. Based on mass continuity and the vertical integration of the observed radial convergence, vertical velocities tend to be underestimated for convective clouds due to the undetected cross-radial convergence. Velocity fields from the UM at a resolution corresponding to the radar observations are used to scale such estimates to mitigate the inherent biases. The analysis of more than 100 observed and simulated storms indicates that the horizontal scale of updraughts in simulations tend to decrease with grid length; the 200 m <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> agreed most closely with the observations. Typical updraught mass fluxes in the 500 m <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> simulations were up to an order of magnitude greater than observed, and greater still in the 1. 5 km <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> simulations. The effect of increasing the mixing length in the sub-grid turbulence scheme depends on the <b>grid</b> <b>length.</b> For the 1. 5 km simulations, updraughts were weakened though their horizontal scale remained largely unchanged. Progressively more so for the sub-kilometre grid lengths, updraughts were broadened and intensified; horizontal scale was now determined by the mixing length rather than the <b>grid</b> <b>length.</b> In general, simulated updraughts were found to weaken too quickly with height. The findings were supported by the analysis of the widths of reflectivity patterns in both the simulations and observations...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{and climate}} model {{simulations}} of the West African Monsoon (WAM) have generally poor {{representation of the}} rainfall distribution and monsoon circulation because key processes, such as clouds and convection, are poorly characterized. The vertical distribution of cloud and precipitation during the WAM are evaluated in Met Office Unified Model simulations against CloudSat observations. Simulations were run at 40 and 12 km horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> using a convection parametrization scheme and at 12, 4, and 1. 5 km <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> with the convection scheme effectively switched off, to study the impact of model resolution and convection parametrization scheme on the organisation of tropical convection. Radar reflectivity is forward-modelled from the model cloud fields using the CloudSat simulator to present a like-with-like comparison with the CloudSat radar observations. The representation of cloud and precipitation at 12 km horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> improves dramatically when the convection parametrization is switched off, primarily because of a reduction in daytime (moist) convection. Further improvement is obtained when reducing model <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> to 4 or 1. 5 km, especially in the representation of thin anvil and mid-level cloud, but three issues remain in all model configurations. Firstly, all simulations underestimate the fraction of anvils with cloud-top height above 12 km, which {{can be attributed to}} too low ice water contents in the model compared to satellite retrievals. Secondly, the model consistently detrains mid-level cloud too close to the freezing level, compared to higher altitudes in CloudSat observations. Finally, there is too much low-level cloud cover in all simulations and this bias was not improved when adjusting the rainfall parameters in the microphysics scheme.

40|$|Refractivity changes (ΔN) {{derived from}} radar ground clutter returns {{serve as a}} proxy for near-surface {{humidity}} changes (1 N unit ≡ 1 % relative humidity at 20 °C). Previous studies have indicated that better humidity observations should improve forecasts of convection initiation. A preliminary assessment of the potential of refractivity retrievals from an operational magnetron-based C-band radar is presented. The increased phase noise at shorter wavelengths, exacerbated by the unknown position of the target within the 300 m gate, make it difficult to obtain absolute refractivity values, so we consider the information in 1 h changes. These have been derived to a range of 30 km with a spatial resolution of ∼ 4 km; the consistency of the individual estimates (within each 4 km × 4 km area) indicates that ΔN errors are about 1 N unit, in agreement with in situ observations. Measurements from an instrumented tower on summer days show that the 1 h refractivity changes up to a height of 100 m remain well correlated with near-surface values. The analysis of refractivity as represented in the operational Met Office Unified Model at 1. 5, 4 and 12 km <b>grid</b> <b>lengths</b> demonstrates that, as model resolution increases, the spatial scales of the refractivity structures improve. It is shown that the magnitude of refractivity changes is progressively underestimated at larger <b>grid</b> <b>lengths</b> during summer. However, the daily time series of 1 h refractivity changes reveal that, whereas the radar-derived values are very well correlated with the in situ observations, the high-resolution model runs have little skill in getting the right values of ΔN {{in the right place at}} the right time. This suggests that the assimilation of these radar refractivity observations could benefit forecasts of the initiation of convection...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of convectively-generated gravity waves during {{an episode of}} deep convection near the coast of Wales are examined in both high resolution mesoscale simulations [with the (UK) Met Oce Unified Model] and in observations from a Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) wind profiling Doppler radar. Deep convection reached the tropopause and generated vertically propagating, high frequency waves in the lower stratosphere that produced vertical velocity perturbations O(1 m/s). Wavelet analysis is applied {{in order to determine}} the characteristic periods and wavelengths of the waves. In both the simulations and observations, the wavelet spectra contain several distinct preferred scales indicated by multiple spectral peaks.

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts at horizontal grid lengths {{in the range of}} 100 m to 1 km are now possible. Within this range of grid lengths, the convective boundary layer (CBL) is partially resolved and thus in the so-called 'grey zone'. For simulations in the grey zone, numerical dissipation sources from both the advection scheme and the subgrid model are likely to be significant. Until now, these effects have not been incorporated fully into our understanding of the grey zone. In order to quantify these effects, a dissipation length scale is defined based on the second moment of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) spectrum. An ensemble of simulations of a CBL are performed using a large-eddy model across the grey-zone resolutions and for a range of subgrid model, advection scheme and vertical grid configurations. The dissipation length scale distinguishes the effects of the different model configurations in the grey zone. In the middle of the boundary layer, the resolved TKE is strongly controlled by the numerical dissipation. This leads to a similarity law for the resolved TKE in the grey zone using the dissipation length scale. A new definition of the grey zone emerges where the inversion depth and dissipation length scale are the same size. This contrasts with the typical definition using the horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>length.</b> At the inversion, however, the variation of the dissipation length scale with <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> is less predictable, reflecting significant challenges for modelling entrainment in the grey zone. The dissipation length scale is thus a simple diagnostic to aid both NWP and large-eddy modellers in understanding the grey zone. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented of a quasi-stationary convective system (QSCS) which {{occurred over the}} UK Southwest Peninsula on 21 July 2010. This system was remarkably similar in its location and structure to one which caused devastating flash flooding in the coastal village of Boscastle, Cornwall on 16 August 2004. However, in the 2010 case rainfall accumulations were around four times smaller and no flooding was recorded. The more extreme nature of the Boscastle case is shown {{to be related to}} three factors: (1) higher rain rates, associated with a warmer and moister tropospheric column and deeper convective clouds; (2) a more stationary system, due to slower evolution of the large-scale flow; and (3) distribution of the heaviest precipitation over fewer river catchments. Overall, however, the synoptic setting of the two events was broadly similar, suggesting that such conditions favour the development of QSCSs over the Southwest Peninsula. A numerical simulation of the July 2010 event was performed using a 1. 5 -km <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> configuration of the Met Office Unified Model. This reveals that convection was repeatedly initiated through lifting of low-level air parcels along a quasi-stationary coastal convergence line. Sensitivity tests are used to show that this convergence line was a sea breeze front which temporarily stalled along the coastline due to the retarding influence of an offshore-directed background wind component. Several deficiencies are noted in the 1. 5 -km model’s representation of the storm system, including delayed convective initiation; however, significant improvements are observed when the <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> is reduced to 500 m. These result in part from an improved representation of the convergence line, which enhances the associated low-level ascent allowing air parcels to more readily reach their level of free convection. The implications of this finding for forecasting convective precipitation are discussed...|$|E

Specifically, MAPS analyses showed that a cyclonically curved upper level jet streak forced upward vertical motion through enhanced divergence in the left exit region.

Strong upward forcing resulted in an intensification of the low level convergence field and further deepening of the cyclone.

40|$|Global {{climate and}} weather models tend to produce {{rainfall}} {{that is too}} light and too regular over the tropical ocean. This is likely because of convective parametrizations, {{but the problem is}} not well understood. Here, distributions of precipitation rates are analyzed for high-resolution UK Met Office Unified Model simulations of a 10 day case study over a large tropical domain (∼ 20 °S– 20 °N and 42 °E– 180 °E). Simulations with 12 km <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> and parametrized convection have too many occurrences of light rain and too few of heavier rain when interpolated onto a 1 ° grid and compared with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data. In fact, this version of the model appears to have a preferred scale of rainfall around 0. 4 mm h− 1 (10 mm day− 1), unlike observations of tropical rainfall. On the other hand, 4 km <b>grid</b> <b>length</b> simulations with explicit convection produce distributions much more similar to TRMM observations. The apparent preferred scale at lighter rain rates seems to be a feature of the convective parametrization rather than the coarse resolution, as demonstrated by results from 12 km simulations with explicit convection and 40 km simulations with parametrized convection. In fact, coarser resolution models with explicit convection tend to have even more heavy rain than observed. Implications for models using convective parametrizations, including interactions of heating and moistening profiles with larger scales, are discussed. One important implication is that the explicit convection 4 km model has temperature and moisture tendencies that favour transitions in the convective regime. Also, the 12 km parametrized convection model produces a more stable temperature profile at its extreme high-precipitation range, which may reduce the chance of very heavy rainfall. Further study is needed to determine whether unrealistic precipitation distributions are due to some fundamental limitation of convective parametrizations or whether parametrizations can be improved, in order to better simulate these distributions...|$|E

A convective system that formed on 27 June 2004 near southeast England, in the vicinity an upper level potential vorticity anomaly and a lowered tropopause, provides the basis for analysis. Transport is diagnosed using a stratospheric tracer that can either be passed through or withheld from the model’s convective parameterization scheme. Three simulations are performed at increasingly finer resolutions, with horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>lengths</b> of 12, 4, and 1 km.

However, the 1 km simulation resolves stirring along the tropopause that {{does not exist in}} the coarser simulations.

A major barrier is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled. Using a meta-analysis of published literature, we show that <b>grid</b> <b>lengths</b> in species distribution models are, on average, ca. 10 000 -fold larger than the animals they study, and ca. 1000 -fold larger than the plants they study. And the gap is even worse than these ratios indicate, as most work has focused on organisms that are significantly biased toward large size. This mismatch is problematic because organisms do not experience climate on coarse scales. Rather, they live in microclimates, which can be highly heterogeneous and strongly divergent from surrounding macroclimates. Bridging the spatial gap should be {{a high priority for}} research and will require gathering climate data at finer scales, developing better methods for downscaling environmental data to microclimates, and improving our statistical understanding of variation at finer scales.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{meteorological}} processes responsible for transporting tracer {{during the second}} ETEX (European Tracer EXperiment) release are determined using the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). The UM predicted distribution of tracer is also compared with observations from the ETEX campaign. The dominant meteorological process is a warm conveyor belt which transports large amounts of tracer away from the surface up to a height of 4 km over a 36 h period. Convection {{is also an important}} process, transporting tracer to heights of up to 8 km. Potential sources of error when using an operational numerical weather prediction model to forecast air quality are also investigated. These potential sources of error include model dynamics, model resolution and model physics. In the UM a semi-Lagrangian monotonic advection scheme is used with cubic polynomial interpolation. This can predict unrealistic negative values of tracer which are subsequently set to zero, and hence results in an overprediction of tracer concentrations. In order to conserve mass in the UM tracer simulations it was necessary to include a flux corrected transport method. Model resolution can also affect the accuracy of predicted tracer distributions. Low resolution simulations (50 km <b>grid</b> <b>length)</b> were unable to resolve a change in wind direction observed during ETEX 2, this led to an error in the transport direction and hence an error in tracer distribution. High resolution simulations (12 km <b>grid</b> <b>length)</b> captured the change in wind direction and hence produced a tracer distribution that compared better with the observations. The representation of convective mixing was found to have a large effect on the vertical transport of tracer. Turning off the convective mixing parameterisation in the UM significantly reduced the vertical transport of tracer. Finally, air quality forecasts were found {{to be sensitive to the}} timing of synoptic scale features. Errors in the position of the cold front relative to the tracer release location of only 1 h resulted in changes in the predicted tracer concentrations that were of the same order of magnitude as the absolute tracer concentrations...|$|E

Since the model is used for operational weather forecasting in Poland the evaluation of this skill contributes to the increase of public safety...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} use of {{high-resolution}} dynamical downscaling {{as a means to}} simulate the regional climatology and variability of hazardous convective-scale weather. Our basic approach differs from a traditional regional climate model application in that it involves a sequence of daily integrations. We use the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, with global reanalysis data as initial and boundary conditions. Horizontal <b>grid</b> <b>lengths</b> of 4. 25 km allow for explicit representation of deep convective storms and hence a compilation of their occurrence statistics over {{a large portion of the}} conterminous United States. The resultant 10 -year sequence of WRF model integrations yields precipitation that, despite its positive bias, has a diurnal cycle consistent with observations, and otherwise has a realistic geographical distribution. Similarly, the occurrence frequency of short-duration, potentially flooding rainfall compares well to analyses of hourly rain gauge data. Finally, the climatological distribution of hazardous-thunderstorm occurrence is shown to be represented with some degree of skill through a model proxy that relates rotating convective updraft cores to the presence of hail, damaging surface winds, and tornadoes. The results suggest that the proxy occurrences, when coupled with information on the larger-scale atmosphere, could provide guidance on the reliability of trends in the observed occurrences.

40|$|The neutron {{diffusion}} equation {{is often used}} to perform core-level neutronic calculations. It consists of a set of second-order partial differential equations over the spatial coordinates that are, both in the academia and in the industry, usually solved by discretizing the neutron leakage term using a structured grid. This work introduces the alternatives that unstructured grids can provide to aid the engineers to solve the {{neutron diffusion}} problem and gives a brief overview of the variety of possibilities they offer. It is by understanding the basic mathematics that lie beneath the equations that model real physical systems; better technical decisions can be made. It is in this spirit that this paper is written, giving a first introduction to the basic concepts which can be incorporated into core-level neutron flux computations. A simple two-dimensional homogeneous circular reactor is solved using a coarse unstructured grid in order to illustrate some basic differences between the finite volumes and the finite elements method. Also, the classic 2 D IAEA PWR benchmark problem is solved for eighty combinations of symmetries, meshing algorithms, basic geometric entities, discretization schemes, and characteristic <b>grid</b> <b>lengths,</b> giving even more insight into the peculiarities that arise when solving the neutron diffusion equation using unstructured grids...|$|R
