50|$|During cold winters {{official}} ice {{roads are}} established between some islands. It is also common {{to drive on}} ice to islands lacking official ice roads. This greatly eases transportation, as it {{makes it possible to}} simply drive a car (or even a <b>heavy</b> <b>van</b> if ice is very thick) from the continent to the islands. On the other hand, during spring and autumn there is a period of thaw (menföre in Swedish, kelirikko in Finnish) when the ice is too thin even for walking, but too thick for boating. This can leave some islands lacking a pier for large ships isolated for days or weeks. Access is only by hydrocopter, hovercraft or helicopter.|$|E

60|$|So we held our {{peace in}} the odious uproar of that wide roadway thronged with <b>heavy</b> carts. Great <b>vans</b> {{carrying}} enormous piled-up loads advanced swaying like mountains.

60|$|A journey up {{from the}} base to the front {{trenches}} shows an interesting series of phases. One leaves Amiens, in which the normal life threads its way through crowds of resting men in khaki and horizon blue, in which staff officers in automobiles whisk hither and thither, {{in which there are}} nurses and even a few inexplicable ladies in worldly costume, in which restaurants and cafes are congested and busy, through which there is a perpetual coming and going of processions of <b>heavy</b> <b>vans</b> to the railway sidings. One dodges past a monstrous blue-black gun going up to the British front behind two resolute traction engines--the three sun-blistered young men in the cart that trails behind lounge in attitudes of haughty pride that would shame the ceiling gods of Hampton Court. One passes through arcades of waiting motor vans, through arcades of waiting motor vans, through suburbs still more intensely khaki or horizon blue, and so out upon the great straight poplar-edged road--to the front. Sometimes one laces through spates of heavy traffic, sometimes the dusty road is clear ahead, now we pass a vast aviation camp, now a park of waiting field guns, now an encampment of cavalry. One turns aside, and abruptly one is in France--France as one knew it before the war, on a shady secondary road, past a delightful chateau behind its iron gates, past a beautiful church, and then suddenly we are in a village street full of stately Indian soldiers.|$|R
60|$|Will this {{diversion}} {{of the vast}} omnibus traffic of to-day {{into the air and}} underground, together with the segregation of van traffic to specific routes and times, be the only change in the streets of the new century? It may be a shock, perhaps, to some minds, but I must confess I do not see what is to prevent the process of elimination that is beginning now with the <b>heavy</b> <b>vans</b> spreading until it covers all horse traffic, and with the disappearance of horse hoofs and the necessary filth of horses, the road surface may be made a very different thing from what it is at present, better drained and admirably adapted for the soft-tired hackney vehicles and the torrent of cyclists. Moreover, there will be little to prevent a widening of the existing side walks, and the protection of the passengers from rain and hot sun by awnings, or such arcades as distinguish Turin, or Sir F. Bramwell's upper footpaths on the model of the Chester rows. Moreover, there is no reason but the existing filth why the roadways should not have translucent velaria to pull over in bright sunshine and wet weather. It would probably need less labour to manipulate such contrivances than is required at present for the constant conflict with slush and dust. Now, of course, we tolerate the rain, because it facilitates a sort of cleaning process....|$|R

He received advice from the physician Nicolaes Tulp and a second opinion from a Roman Catholic physician.

40|$|Research {{published}} in Deinsea by van der Hoven et al.

40|$|An unusual quasi-two-dimensional <b>heavy</b> band mass <b>van</b> Hove {{singularity}} (vHs) lies {{very near}} the Fermi energy in MgCNi 3, recently reported to superconduct at 8. 5 K.

The 1 / 4 -depleted fcc (frustrated) Ni sublattice and lack of Fermi surface nesting argues against competing antiferromagnetic and charge density wave instabilities. We identify an essentially infinite mass along the M-Gamma line, leading to quasi-two-dimensionality of this vHs may promote unconventional p-wave pairing that could coexist with superconductivity.

However saving overseas funds became the priority after the 1973 war in the Middle East, multiplied oil costs and the final fit out of the train was not approved until November 1974 with instructions to complete the rebuild of the minimum rolling stock for the introduction of the Express replacement within 12 months.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which components of heavy-duty highway vehicles are candidates for the substitution of titanium materials for current materials if the cost of those Ti components is very significantly reduced from current levels.

Class 8 is characterized as being a very cyclic market, with ''normal'' year volume, such as in 2000, of approximately 240, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 7 are less cyclic, with ''normal'' i. e., year 2000, volume totaling approximately 325, 000 new vehicles. Classes 3 - 8 are powered about 88. 5 % by diesel engines, and Class 2 C at very roughly 83 % diesel. The engine portion of the study therefore focused on diesels.
