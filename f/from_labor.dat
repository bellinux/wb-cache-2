5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement <b>from</b> <b>Labor</b> MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E
5|$|During the Fringe team's search, Fauxlivia {{finds herself}} being put under a {{treatment}} to accelerate her pregnancy, bringing her child near term. She {{is able to}} escape from her captors and contact Fringe division to identify her location, but struggles <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> pains as the child {{is about to be}} born. Henry drives Lincoln to her location, and they are able to help Fauxlivia to deliver her child, a son, before medical help arrives. Fauxlivia and her child recover under tight security ordered by Walternate, fearing for their safety. The doctors determine the accelerated pregnancy outpaced the virus, thus allowing both Fauxlivia and her child to survive.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Thompson began {{testing the}} waters for higher office. He raised {{campaign}} funds and consulted party leaders {{about the possibility}} of challenging United States House of Representatives then 76-year-old congresswoman Louise Slaughter who was already a 10-term veteran. Slaughter's New York's 28th congressional district was 29 percent African American, and minorities comprised nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote. Charles B. Rangel warned that Slaughter had strong ties to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as strong support <b>from</b> <b>labor,</b> women's and pro-choice groups.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg lived most of {{his later}} life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and {{publishing}} the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied {{a group of scientists}} who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> organizations and others.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster {{from the}} army of Connacht in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when {{he should have been}} watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
50|$|At the 1963 election, Calwell {{hoped to}} build on his gains from two years earlier, but was {{severely}} damaged by a picture in The Daily Telegraph that showed him and Whitlam outside a Canberra hotel, waiting for word <b>from</b> <b>Labor's</b> Federal Conference as to the policies upon which they should fight the election.|$|R
50|$|The 1957 ALP split, where Premier Vince Gair {{led many}} MPs {{to form the}} Queensland Labor Party (QLP), {{undermined}} the malapportionment's advantage to Labor. Since the boundaries were drawn {{to take advantage of}} the ALP's rural supporters (farm workers, miners etc.) the rural-based Country Party were able to take the most advantage <b>from</b> <b>Labor's</b> infighting.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, as Kligman and Verdery explain, [...] "Collectivization brought undeniable {{benefits}} to some rural inhabitants, {{especially those who}} had owned little or no land. It freed them <b>from</b> <b>laboring</b> on the fields of others, and it increased their control over wages, lending to their daily existence a stability previously unknown to them." ...|$|R
5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made slaves). However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's role {{as defense}} {{minister}} {{had already made}} him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950 the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, as well as <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> unions. Árbenz carefully chose the PIN as the party to nominate him. Based {{on the advice of}} his friends and colleagues, he believed it would make his candidacy appear more moderate. Árbenz himself resigned his position as Defense Minister on February 20 and declared his candidacy for the presidency. Arévalo wrote him an enthusiastic personal letter in response but publicly only reluctantly endorsed him, preferring, it is thought, his friend Víctor Manuel Giordani, who was then Health Minister. It was only the support Árbenz had, and the impossibility of Giordani being elected, that led to Arévalo deciding to support Árbenz.|$|E

5|$|The rift in the Democratic party {{caused by}} the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's {{supporters}} were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising {{continued to be a}} major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but {{that he would not be}} heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.|$|E

This announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, as well as <b>from</b> <b>labor</b> unions. Árbenz had {{only a couple of}} significant challengers in the election, in a field of ten candidates. One of these was Jorge García Granados, who was supported by some members of the upper-middle class who felt the revolution had gone too far. Another was Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who had been a general under Ubico, and who had the support of the hardline opponents of the revolution. During his campaign, Árbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Arévalo. The election was held on 15 November 1950, and Árbenz won more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were free and fair {{with the exception of the}} disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. Árbenz was inaugurated as president on 15 March 1951.|$|E
