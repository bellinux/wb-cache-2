He began his {{professional}} acting career during the late 1970s.Sixolo was also {{a founding member of}} the renowned Kings Messengers Quartet. Together with three adventist friends; Billy Mahlalela, Justice Masinga and Alex Maseko he began this exceptional quartet who was great in the sixties and seventies. Beginning at Bethel College, Butterworth in the former Transkei in the early fifties, Washington Sixolo was the main reason why the Kings Messengers earned great recognition in South Africa and abroad. When hearing the Kings Messengers Quartet, former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda could not resist hearing them in person. He arranged a full paid trip for this world class quartet to sing for him in his presidential suite and elsewhere in Zambia. Sixolo, still part of the quartet took three new members; Norman Dube (1st Tenor), Mike Thlokoane (2nd Tenor) and Gift Makapela (Baritone) with him to sing for Kaunda in 1970. Sixolo sang up to the late seventies for the Kings Messengers before joining the SABC on a fulltime basis. The other members of the Kings Messengers Quartet in order of appearances were Billy Mahlalela (Baritone, founder), Washington Sixolo (bass), Justice Masinga (1st tenor), Alex Maseko (2nd tenor), Moses Khumalo (1st tenor), Norman Dube (1st tenor), Palmer Paul Kote (2nd tenor), Gift Makapela (baritone), Mike Thlokoane (2nd tenor), Joseph Mhlanga (2nd tenor), Stephen Motha (baritone), Vincent Mvelase (2nd tenor), Zolani Sixolo (1st tenor) and Samson Phakhati (bass). Sixolo appeared on 7 of the 8 abums the Kings Messengers made over the years.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet document rapid changes in the mass balance of its component glaciers. These observations {{raise the question of}} whether changind climatic conditions have triggered a dynamical instability in the ice-sheet-ice-shelf system. The dynamics of marine ice sheets are sensitive to grounding-line position and variation, characteristics that are poorly captured by most current models. We present a theory for grounding-line dynamics in three spatial dimensions and time. Out theory is based on a balance of forces across the grounding line; it is expressed as a differential equation that is analogous to the canonical Stefan condition. We apply this theory to the question of grounding-line stability under conditions of retrograde bed slope in a suite of calculations with different basal topography. A subset of these have based topography inspired by the Pine Island glacier, where basal depth varies in both the along-flow and across-flow directions. Our results indicate that unstable retreat of the grounding line over retrograde beds is a robust <b>feauture</b> of models that evolve based on force balance at the grounding-line. We conclude, based on our simplified model, that unstable grounding-line recession may already be occuring at the Pine Island glacier.

40|$|When brain {{mechanism}} {{carry out}} motion integration and segmentation processes that compute unambiguous global motion percepts from ambiguous local motion signals? Consider, for example, a deer running at variable speeds behind forest cover. The forest cover is an occluder that creates apertures through which {{fragments of the}} deer's motion signals are intermittently experienced. The brain coherently groups these fragments into a trackable percept of the deer in its trajectory. Form and motion processes are needed to accomplish this using feedforward and feedback interactions both within and across cortical processing streams. All the cortical areas V 1, V 2, MT, and MST are involved in these interactions. Figure-ground processes in the form stream through V 2, such as the seperation of occluding boundaries of the forest cover from {{the boundaries of the}} deer, select the motion signals which determine global object motion percepts in the motion stream through MT.

Therefore it is very effective to remove {{the shadow of a}} vehicle on the road. And we can detect the boundary of vehicles accurately. In the paper, the vehicle detection algorithm can be divided into two main steps. One is hypothesis generation, and the other is hypothesis verification. In the first step, it determines vehicle candidates using features such as a shadow, intensity, and vertical edge. And in the second step, it determines whether the candidate is a vehicle or not by using the symmetry of vehicle edge features. In this research, we can get the detection rate over 15 frames per second on our embedded system.

The dominating theoretical research in the current studies of Neutrino Factories programs {{are related to the}} analysis of the possibility to detect parameters of neutrino oscilations. Since high-statistics measurments of cross-sections of νN-scattering with more intensive low-energu ν-beams allow one to get more reliable estimates of background effects to future oscillations experiments, theoretical analysis of these processes started to attrackt more interest. Moreover, these studies may allow one to get new information about the behaviour of cross-sections and extracted formfactors and structure functions (SFs) in elastic, quasi-elastic and deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) regimes. In view of this even at low energies the option for front-end non-oscillation physics should be investigated in more detail. In particular, the analysis of the data in DIS region may provide high-presision information about polarized parton distributions [1],[2] in the x, Q 2 -regions, complementary to the ones, available at JLAB.

40|$|GIST are {{the most}} common mesenchymal tumors of the {{digestive}} system. Their putative cell of origin is the interstitial cell of Cajal, which regulates the motility of the bowel, or a related progenitor cell. About 95 % of GISTs express the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. About 80 - 85 % of GISTs carry somatic activating mutations in the KIT gene or in the PDGFRA gene, being the causative events in GIST development. Activated KIT/PDGFRA activate similar downstream signalling molecules including MAPK and AKT that eventually promote cell proliferation and survival. GIST cells are strongly dependent on KIT/PDGFRA activity and extremely sensitive to TKI, such as imatinib. The type of KIT/PDGFRA mutations is a major determinant of response to imatinib treatment, which is maintained in patients until disease progression and is rarely or never curative. The majority of GIST patients develop imatinib resistance during treatment. GIST patients refractory to imatinib are treated with sunitinib, another TKI. Eventually, sunitinib also ceases to be effective, leaving GISTs patients without alternative, approved treatment options. Resistance to TKI is either pre-existing or acquired through the clonal evolution of cells harboring secondary mutations that hamper TKI activity, or through KIT amplification. Resistant mutations occur either in the ATP-binding site or in the phosphotransferase domain of KIT, showing site-dependent and heterogeneous sensitivity to alternative KIT inhibtors. Resistant mutations may be present synchronously in the same patient at different metastatic sites, or even within the same metastasis. Drug resistance can only be overcome for a limited period of time by the use of alternative TKIs. Thus it is unlikely that alternative KIT inhibitors are uniformly effective against all possible mutations, as their pharmacological effects are highly specific. The development of novel therapeutic strategies represents a major challenge for GIST therapy. In the present doctoral thesis we have tested the efficacy of three different experimental compounds which target HDAC enzymes, the chaperone protein HSP 90 and the PI 3 K. These compounds were used as single agents or in combination with imatinib or sunitinib in a panel of diverse GIST xenograft carrying distinctive KIT mutations. HDAC inhibitors are long known in psychiatry and neurology as mood stabilizers and anti-epileptics. However, in the past decades they emerged as anti-cancer compounds showing remarkable anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. HDAC inhibitors primarily act through the transcriptional reactivation of dormant tumor suppressor genes. Their targets, histone deacetylases, are involved in tumorigenesis through either aberrant recruitment to promoters or enhanced expression, resulting in histone deacetylation and transcription repression. Non-histone proteins, such as HSP 90, are also HDAC substrates and the antitumor effect of HDAC inhibitors is attributed to transcription-independentmechanisms as well. HSP 90 activity has been implicated in the activation and maturation of mutant KIT oncoproteins. By using the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat, we demonstrated that this HDAC inhibitor has a strong anti-tumor potential against GISTs. Overall, GIST xenografts responded rapidly to panobinostat as indicated by significant tumor regression. Further evidence of the activity of panobinostat was provided by the observation of prominent necrosis, hemorrhages, fibrosis, and/or myxoid degeneration, remarkable apoptosis and substantial decline of cell proliferation. Under panobinostat, the acetylation status of the core histones H 3 and H 4 increased significantly from control levels, indicating the bioavailability of the compound. Diarrhea and thrombocytopenia were occasionally seen in LBH 589 treated mice and are also reported as side effects in patients receiving HDAC inhibitors. Although there were no statistical evidences for an enhanced effect of panobinostat-imatinib combination on tumor regression, we observed more prominent histopathological changes in combination than in single treatment arms, including higher apoptotic activity and histone acetylation. These finding suggested that the activity of the combination panobinostat-imatinib was superior than either treatment alone. HSP 90 {{is one of the most}} abundant proteins in a cell. HSP 90 may regulate the conformation, function and activation of a number of proteins named client proteins. Among them are kinases and transcription factors that are involved in the control of pivotal cellular functions such as cell signaling, proliferation, and survival. Many of these functions are deregulated in cancer, thus the pharmacological inhibiton of the chaperone activity of HSP 90 may represent a very powerful and useful strategy for the treatment of certain malignancies. HSP 90 activity is regulated by a number of co-factors (co-chaperones), as well as conformational changes requiring ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase function of HSP 90. HSP 90 inhibitors act by competitively blocking the HSP 90 enzymatic activity, resulting in degradation of its client proteins. The KIT receptor is one of the HSP 90 client proteins. In the second study we tested the activity of the semisynthetic HSP 90 inhibitors IPI- 504 and IPI- 493 as single agents, and in combination with imatinib or sunitinib. Both compounds caused either tumor regression or tumor burden stabilization in a series of highly aggressive GIST. On histology, we observed significant induction of histologic response; apoptosis and proliferation arrest were promoted as well at variable levels by both compounds. Degradation of KIT occurred only at a minimal level in most xenografts treated with IPI- 504 or IPI- 493. By contrast, a more obvious inhibition of KIT and its signaling cascade was observed, suggesting that the interaction between HSP 90 and different KIT oncoproteins may vary. Proof of the bioavailability of the drugs was provided by the augmented expression of HSP 70, a standard <b>feauture</b> observed in tumor cells treated with HSP 90 inhibitors. The therapeutic window of both IPI- 504 and IPI- 493 seems to be limited by dose-dependent liver toxicities. Another observation of our study was the remarkable activity of sunitinib as single agent, which provided equal or superior anti-tumor activities than imatinib in most of the xenografts used. Overall, the combination HSP 90 -inhibitor+SUN yielded the best anti-tumor activity in terms of tumor shrinkage and of magnitude of histopatholologic response, especially in xenografts carrying KIT double resistant mutations. The PI 3 K/AKT pathway promotes cell proliferation, cell survival, metabolism and motility and is controlled by the phosphatase and tensin homologue gene on chromosome 10 (PTEN). PTEN is a phosphatase targeting both proteins and lipids located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The best characterized role of PTEN is the PI 3 K inhibition. Hence, by functioning upstream of PI 3 K and AKT, PTEN controls the activation of the whole pathway, and may influence the activity of the MAPK pathway as well. Not surprisingly, deregulation of PTEN, PI 3 K and AKT are among the most common aberrations in cancer. Clinically applicable approaches to counteract the effects of the deregulated PTEN/PI 3 K/AKT pathway include a number of PI 3 K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors that are currently studied. In primary and imatinib-resistant GISTs the oncogenic signaling is sustained primarily via the PI 3 K/AKT rather than the RAS/MAPK pathway. By testing the efficacy of the PI 3 K inhibitor GDC- 0941 we aimed at demonstrating the therapeutic advantage of combined PI 3 K-inhibitor+imatinib in comparison to imatinib treatment. In addition, we have correlated the results obtained to the levels of PTEN protein expression. Single agent treatment with GDC- 0941 caused either tumor growth stabilization or tumor growth delay. GDC- 0941 reduced the proliferative activity of GIST xenograft but did not stimulate apoptosis. When GDC- 0941 was combined with imatinib, we observed dramatic tumor regression which was in most of the xenograft superior than that measured under imatinib single agent. Micro-PET studies performed on two of the models confirmed our findings on caliper measurements, and indicated that the combination treatment was the most efficient in reducing the glucose uptake of GIST xenografts. On histology we observed the most prominent grades of histologic response, a nearly complete arrest of proliferation and increased apoptotic activity in the xenograft under combination regimen. We also performed tumor re-growth assays after treatment discontinuation in xenografts treated with imatinib or with the combination regimen. These experiments confirmed the superior activity of the combination treatment in comparison to imatinib, since in two of the models the tumor volume remained small and stable even after treatment discontinuation. This observation was also confirmed by micro-PET studies in one of the two xenograft model analyzed. On histology, signs of histologic response after treatment were still visible in most of the tumor treatedwith the combination regimen. Probably most intriguing was the finding that two out of five xenografts did not retain PTEN expression, both at the genomic and protein level. Thus we identified two groups of xenografts according to the PTEN protein status, and we observed that in PTEN lacking xenografts, the combination GDC+IMA yielded the most remarkable results in terms of tumor regression, histologic response, proliferation arrest, induction of apoptosis and long lasting effects upon treatment stop. This finding warrants further study to better understand the role of PTEN in the biology of GIST. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the efficacy of three novel therapeutic strategies that if safe and feasible in the clinic, could be implemented in GIST therapy. The combination of imatinib or sunitinib with the experimental compounds tested was more effective than either treatment alone, supporting the innovative concept of combination therapy in GIST. The success of these compounds may depend on the KIT genotype or to other intrinsic molecular features of GIST. The application of novel high throughput molecular techniques could help to identify the expression of druggable targets and biomarkers for a better selection of GIST patients and improved treatment outcome. status: publishe...|$|E

Because of the non-steady and unbounded characteristics of the simulation, the previous measures are extended to a moving frame approach to create time-dependent mixing rates that are dependent upon the initial time of particle integration, and are computed for nonlocal regions. The global measures of mixing derived from finite-time Lyapunov exponents, relative dispersion, and a measured mixing rate are applied to distinct regions representing different characteristic <b>feautures</b> within the model. It is shown that these time-dependent mixing rates exhibit correlations with maximal tangential winds during a quasi-steady state, establishing a connection between mixing and hurricane intensity...|$|R

Moreover they show that investment speci 8 ̆ 5 c shocks imply almost exclusively adjustments along the intensive margin.
