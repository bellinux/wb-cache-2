5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the government over {{the size of}} the Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Mylne succeeded him as master mason to the crown.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{had been}} <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Chopra for a {{different}} project before, which would have paired her with Saif Ali Khan.

Siddharth Anand's adaptation of 2 States would film {{at the same time as}} Kohli's proposed film. Anand and Kohli met and agreed that Chopra would act in 2 States. Later, Kohli approached Chopra with a new script, and she agreed to join the cast for Teri Meri Kahaani. Prachi Desai and Neha Sharma were cast to play Kapoor's love interests in the 1960s and 2012, respectively.|$|E

It was during this festival that the core structure of the event was finalised following a meeting with committee members. These principles of the event are to promote the languages, musical talents and cultures within the six territories recognised as Celtic nations.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} would deteriorate further, additional legal and financial irregularities were uncovered, leaving Smallpeice {{and the other}} directors to consider resignation. Smallpeice was informed, after consulting Nicholas Wilson, a partner with Slaughter and May {{that he and the}} other directors could leave themselves liable to legal action for dereliction of duty. Counsel advised Smallpeice and the other directors that they should submit Lonrho to inspection by the Department of Trade and Industry, but <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Leslie O'Brien, this course of action was recommended against.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 {{that he would not be}} returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Sukhoi {{embarked}} on a second modernization of the Su-27 {{to serve as an}} interim aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as Su-35, this derivative has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system compared to the Su-27M, and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the omitted canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although the aircraft was designed for export, the Russian Air Force in 2009 became the launch customer of the aircraft, the production version of which is designated Su-35S. China's People's Liberation Army Air Force is the sole foreign user of the aircraft. Other countries are reportedly <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Russia about the possible purchase of the Su-35, among which is Indonesia, whose government is expected to sign a contract in the near future.|$|E

5|$|In March 1999, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} their teaming with Dodd Darin on a biopic, with collaboration from producer Arthur Friedman, {{who had been}} developing both The Bobby Darin Story and Dreamer with Levinson at Warner Bros. since 1986. Shortly afterwards, Spacey was <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Dodd Darin to star in the lead role. Spacey was able to acquire the film rights from Warner Bros. in early 2000. With the help of Dodd Darin, the actor also received exclusive music rights for no charge. With his Academy Award-winning performance in American Beauty (1999), Paramount Pictures became interested in distributing/financing Beyond the Sea. The deal fell apart when Paramount told Spacey {{was that he was}} too old for the role and instead wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Beginning in October 2000, Spacey took vocal training lessons from Darin collaborator Roger Kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of the singer.|$|E
5|$|Marvel Comics {{writers and}} chief editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas wrote an X-Men {{screenplay}} in 1984 when Orion Pictures held an option {{on the film}} rights, but development stalled when Orion began facing financial troubles. Throughout 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Carolco Pictures for an X-Men film adaptation, with James Cameron as producer and Kathryn Bigelow directing. A story treatment was written by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins being considered for Wolverine and Angela Bassett being considered {{for the role of}} Storm. The deal fell apart when Stan Lee piqued Cameron's interest on a Spider-Man film, Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights reverting to Marvel. In December 1992, Marvel discussed selling the property to Columbia Pictures to no avail. Meanwhile, Avi Arad produced the animated X-Men TV series for Fox Kids. 20th Century Fox was impressed by the success of the TV show, and producer Lauren Shuler Donner purchased the film rights for them in 1994, bringing Andrew Kevin Walker to write the script.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Family {{used the}} line from 1853 to travel to Balmoral Castle; in September 1866 the British Royal Train used Ballater station nearly a month before public {{services}} reached the station. At first Queen Victoria visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after Edward VII became king in 1901. From 8 October 1865 a daily 'Messenger Train' ran when the Royal Family was at Balmoral. First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the SNER proposed a new line that crossed the Deeside Railway. Whilst <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the SNER about a link from this new line to the Deeside, a lease for the Deeside Railway was offered to the Great North, which was rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne & Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the Great North.|$|E
