The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{continued}} to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the complexity and length of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture {{continued to}} follow that of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower house style would also be adopted in the north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} tune {{sometimes used}} for [...] "My Hope <b>Is</b> <b>Built</b> on Nothing Less" [...] is MELITA, composed by John B. Dykes. The advantage of MELITA for [...] "My Hope <b>Is</b> <b>Built</b> on Nothing Less" [...] is that MELITA automatically emphasizes the word rock (which {{is central to}} the lyrics) by dedicating one and one-half beats to that word (where in SOLID ROCK it has merely an eighth note). A disadvantage of MELITA is that the tune is inextricably identified with the hymn [...] "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" [...] (commonly recognized in the United States as the [...] "Navy Hymn").|$|R

After a devastating earthquake struck Shamakhi, the capital of Shirvan, Shirvanshah’s court moved to Baku in 1191.|$|E

Certain modifications were implemented, including expanding the structure along the transversal axis which better fit with the Islamic style of prayer.|$|E
25|$|Another King {{to improve}} the Palace was John V, who {{invested}} great sums – derived from the gold mines in colonial Brazil – to enlarge and embellish the Ribeira Palace. The original manueline chapel {{was turned into a}} magnificent baroque church, and the Palace gained another wing, parallel to the previous one. Later in the century, King Joseph <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a Royal Opera House by the Palace, designed by the Italian Giuseppe Bibiena.|$|E

25|$|Urban {{development}} of {{the banks of the}} Tagus river (the Ribeira) was given a definitive impulse in the early 16th century, when King Manuel <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a new royal residence – the Ribeira Palace – by the river, outside the city walls. The area was further developed with the building of a port, shipbuilding facilities (the Ribeira das Naus), the Casa da Índia and other administrative buildings that regulated the commerce between Portugal and other parts of Europe and its colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Amenemhat <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a {{new capital}} for Egypt, Itjtawy, {{thought to be}} located near the present-day Lisht, {{although}} Manetho claims the capital remained at Thebes. Amenemhat forcibly pacified internal unrest, curtailed {{the rights of the}} nomarchs, and is known to have at launched at least one campaign into Nubia. His son Senusret I continued the policy of his father to recapture Nubia and other territories lost during the First Intermediate Period. The Libu were subdued under his forty-five year reign and Egypt's prosperity and security were secured.|$|E

25|$|Three years later, in 1150, Afonso <b>I</b> <b>built</b> {{a cathedral}} {{on the site}} of the Great Mosque, now the Sé. The {{original}} Christian edifice built on the site had been converted into a mosque by the Moors, but when Afonso took the city, the building was already decrepit. He had the structure rebuilt and enlarged under the name of the first cathedral of Lisbon, Santa María, and all the privileges of Mérida, the ancient ecclesiastical capital of the former Roman province of Lusitania, passed to the new diocese.|$|E

Most likely around 1550 he moved to Novellara, a town {{in what is now}} the Province of Reggio Emilia, as a musician in the service of a branch of the Gonzagas; a previous suggestion that he may have been in Rome has not been securely established. Novellara in the mid-sixteenth century was a significant musical center under its local branch of the Gonzaga family. Alfonso <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a theatre and staged dramatic performances at his castle, with his young Flemish choirmaster in charge.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the mound {{contained}} an oak-built main chamber (Grave <b>I),</b> <b>built</b> on the original ground level. It measured 5.7 by 3.5 m and was circa 1 m high. This grave, containing {{a man and a}} woman, had already been plundered shortly after the burial. The remaining finds, reflecting its original riches include horse trappings, nearly 600 glass beads from a necklace, pieces of amber, and fine gold threads that were originally part of a brocade-like fabric. The floor had been covered with cowskins. A central mound, 5m high and 40 m in diameter covered this chamber.|$|E

25|$|Early in his reign, Amenemhet I was {{compelled}} to campaign in the Delta region, which had not received {{as much attention as}} upper Egypt during the 11th Dynasty. In addition, he strengthened defenses between Egypt and Asia, building the Walls of the Ruler in the East Delta region. Perhaps in response to this perpetual unrest, Amenemhat <b>I</b> <b>built</b> a new capital for Egypt in the north, known as Amenemhet Itj Tawy, or Amenemhet, Seizer of the Two Lands. The location of this capital is unknown, but is presumably near the city's necropolis, the present-day el-Lisht. Like Mentuhotep II, Amenemhet bolstered his claim to authority with propaganda. In particular, the Prophecy of Neferty dates to about this time, which purports to be an oracle of an Old Kingdom priest, who predicts a king, Amenemhet I, arising from the far south of Egypt to restore the kingdom after centuries of chaos.|$|E
25|$|Later, the Romans bred and {{exported}} fighting dogs to Spain, France {{and other}} parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England. Though bull baiting and bear baiting were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale like no other. In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting {{to the rest of the}} British population. In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558–1603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England. In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James <b>I,</b> <b>built</b> a number of bear gardens in London. The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight. Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.|$|E
