25|$|<b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt,</b> who {{had been}} a {{producer}} of the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, sought out Wallace as a stylistic contrast to Reasoner. According to one historian of the show, the idea of the format was to make the hosts the reporters, to always feature stories that were of national importance but focused upon individuals involved with, or in conflict with, those issues, and to limit the reports' airtime to around 13 minutes. However, the initial season was troubled by lack of network confidence, as the program did not garner ratings much higher than that of other CBS News documentaries. As a rule, during that era, news programming during prime time lost money; networks mainly scheduled public affairs programs in prime time in order to bolster the prestige of their news departments, and thus boost ratings for the regular evening newscasts, which were seen by far more people than documentaries and the like. 60 Minutes struggled under that stigma during its first three years.|$|E
500|$|For Harris' immolation scene, first unit {{director}} Gary Rake emphasized safety, {{explaining that}} [...] "everyone {{really has to}} think about what’s going on and really focus tonight. This is a quintessential moment where we can’t have any mistakes." [...] Everything in the scene was flame retardant, and a special burn unit crew was present. Actor Michael Gaston's arm, immersed in a special gel, was actually inflamed and then extinguished after filming was cut. Then, Gaston's stand-in, stuntman <b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt,</b> Jr, was completely set on fire. Hewitt wore the same costume, a wig, a face shield, and was also covered in a flammable gel. It was Gaston's final episode with the series.|$|E
500|$|In {{conversation}} with Wright and Edelemen, Kennedy remarked, [...] "The only way there's {{going to be}} change is if it's more uncomfortable for Congress not to act {{than it is for}} them to act...You've got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to Washington and stay here untilCongress gets really embarrassed and they have to act." [...] The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington. Around the same time CBS broadcast a major documentary, Hunger in America, which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive <b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... 60 Minutes is an American newsmagazine {{television}} program broadcast on the CBS television network. Debuting in 1968, {{the program was}} created by <b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt,</b> who chose to set it apart from other news programs by using a unique style of reporter-centered investigation. In 2002, 60 Minutes was ranked #6 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and in 2013, it was ranked #24 on TV Guide's 60 Best Series of All Time. The New York Times has called it [...] "one of the most esteemed news magazines on American television".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 23, CBS lost the bidding for the footage to Life magazine's $150,000 offer. CBS news {{correspondent}} Dan Rather {{was the first to}} report on the footage on national television after seeing it, although the inaccuracies in his description would contribute to many conspiracy theories about the assassination. In his 2001 book Tell Me A Story, CBS producer <b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt</b> said that he told Rather to go to Zapruder's home to [...] "sock him in the jaw", take the film, copy it, then return it and let the network's lawyers deal with the consequences. According to Hewitt, he realized his mistake after ending their telephone conversation and immediately called Rather back to countermand the order. In a 2015 interview on Opie with Jim Norton, Rather stated that the story was a myth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, former Brown & Williamson Vice President for Research and Development Jeffrey Wigand {{provided}} information to 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman that B had systematically hidden {{the health risks}} of their cigarettes (see [...] ). Furthermore, it was alleged that B had introduced foreign agents (such as fiberglass and ammonia) {{with the intent of}} enhancing the effect of nicotine. Bergman began to produce a piece based upon the information, but ran into opposition from <b>Don</b> <b>Hewitt</b> who, along with CBS lawyers, feared a billion dollar lawsuit from Brown and Williamson for tortious interference for encouraging Wigand to violate his non-disclosure agreement. A number of people at CBS would benefit from a sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including the head of CBS lawyers and CBS News. Also, because of the interview, the son of CBS President Laurence Tisch (who also controlled Lorillard Tobacco) was among the people from the big tobacco companies at risk of being caught having committed perjury. Due to Hewitt's hesitation, The Wall Street Journal instead broke Wigand's story. The 60 Minutes piece was eventually aired with substantially altered content and minus some of the most damning evidence against B The exposé of the incident was published in an article in Vanity Fair by Marie Brenner, entitled [...] "The Man Who Knew Too Much".|$|E
