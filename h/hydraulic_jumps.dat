5|$|A {{catastrophic flood}} in March 1913, {{known as the}} Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

25|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{can result}} in internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> (i.e., <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> as internal waves in fluids of different density) in abyssal fan formation. The internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> {{have been associated with}} salinity or temperature induced stratification as well as with density differences due to suspended materials. When the slope of the bed (over which the turbidity current flows) flattens, the slower rate of flow is mirrored by increased sediment deposition below the flow, producing a gradual backward slope. Where a hydraulic jump occurs, the signature is an abrupt backward slope, corresponding to the rapid reduction in the flow rate at the point of the jump.|$|E

50|$|The {{height of}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump,</b> similar to length, is useful to know when {{designing}} waterway structures like settling basins or spillways. The {{height of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is simply the difference in flow depths prior to and after the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump.</b> The height can be determined using the Froude number and upstream energy.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} engineering applications of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is to dissipate energy in channels, dam spillways, and similar structures so that the excess kinetic energy does not damage these structures. The rate of energy dissipation or head loss across a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> {{is a function of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> inflow Froude number and the height of the jump.|$|R
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} also {{occurs in}} air flows over mountains. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> {{have been described}} by glider pilots in the Andes and Alps.|$|E
25|$|NB: {{the above}} {{classification}} is very rough. Undular <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> {{have been observed}} with inflow/prejump Froude numbers up to 3.5 to 4.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} manifestations of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> and {{historically}} different terminology {{has been used for}} each. However, the mechanisms behind them are similar because they are simply variations of each other seen from different frames of reference, and so the physics and analysis techniques can be used for both types.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> occurs {{downstream}} of the flume {{for free}} flow conditions. As the flume becomes submerged, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> diminishes and ultimately disappears as the downstream conditions increasingly restrict the flow {{out of the}} flume.|$|R
50|$|Conjugate depths {{refer to}} the depth (y1) {{upstream}} and the depth (y2) downstream of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> whose momentum functions are equal for a given unit discharge,q. The depth upstream of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is always supercritical, and the depth downstream of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is always subcritical. It {{is important to note}} that the conjugate depth is different than the alternate depths for flow which are used in energy conservation calculations.|$|R
25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E
2500|$|For a known {{flow rate}} [...] {{as shown by}} the figure below, the {{approximation}} that the momentum flux is the same just up- and downstream of the energy principle yields an expression of the energy loss in the hydraulic jump. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> are commonly used as energy dissipators downstream of dam spillways.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> {{can be seen}} in both a {{stationary}} form, which is known as a [...] "hydraulic jump", and a dynamic or moving form, which is known as a positive surge or [...] "hydraulic jump in translation".

In the present study the effect of trapezoidal shape corrugated bed on flow characteristics of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> has been experimentally investigated. Total of 42 tests conducted in a flumes of 25 and 50 cm in width. Experimental were performed for wide range of Froude numbers ranging from 4 to 12. Six values of the relative roughness of corrugated shapes were studied. In all tests water surface profile and in 10 tests the vertical and the axial velocity profile were measured. From the analysis of data, the relative conjugate depths {{and the length of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> were plotted against the Froude number. Comparison of these parameters with the same parameters in smooth bed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> shows that the conjugate depth decreases 20 % and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> length decreases 50 %.

40|$|The Boussinesq {{equations}} are numerically solved {{to simulate}} the formation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> in a rectangular channel having a small bed slope. The MacCormack scheme is used for their solution by applying specified initial and boundary conditions until a steady state flow is reached. The location of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is determined {{as a part of}} these computations. The artificial viscosity technique should be used in the computations to dampen the superior oscillations near the steep gradient of the simulated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump.</b> Twelve laboratory experiments were carried out for verification of the numerical model. Upstream Froude number for these experiments ranged from 2. 17 to 3. 83. The simulated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> profiles using the MacCormack scheme showed good agreement with the experimental data.

2500|$|Practically {{this means}} that water {{accelerated}} by large drops can create stronger standing waves (undular bores) {{in the form of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jumps</b> as it decelerates {{at the base of the}} drop.

2500|$|Figure 4 {{illustrates}} the different surface water profiles {{associated with a}} sluice gate on a mild reach (top) and a steep reach (bottom). [...] Note, the sluice gate induces a choke in the system, causing a “backwater” profile just upstream of the gate. [...] In the mild reach, the hydraulic jump occurs downstream of the gate, but in the steep reach, the hydraulic jump occurs upstream of the gate. [...] It {{is important to note}} that the gradually varied flow equations and associated numerical methods (including the standard step method) cannot accurately model the dynamics of a hydraulic jump.

40|$|One of {{the usual}} ways to {{dissipate}} excess energy in the dam's downstream is <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> is a rapidly varied flow, in which the flow conditions change from supercritical to sub-critical with {{a large amount of}} energy loss. In this research, a combination of two water jets in the form of overflow dam and underflow through a slot on the body of an ogee dam with the USBR standard was established in order to decrease the length and sequent depth in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump.</b> In these experiments, the underflow from the slot was designed with three out passages of 0, 45, and 90 degrees in respect horizontal line. Six different discharge ratios were used for each slot and the effect of each experiment conditions on decreasing of the length and sequent depth of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> was investigated. The results showed that the confluence of two jets with 45 degrees from the slot had the maximum effect on the reducing of the length of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> and sequent depth, and when 26 percent of the total discharge passed through the slot as underflow, it caused the length of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> to be reduced by 50 percent in comparison with the classic jump. This slot not only decreases the length and sequent depth of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jump</b> but also the sediment behind the dam can be evacuated through it.
