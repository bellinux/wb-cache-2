40|$|Moessbauer {{studies were}} carried out on lunar fines and on {{simulated}} lunar glasses containing magnetic-like precipitates with the primary objective of determining how much, if any, ferric oxide is present in the lunar soils. Although unambiguous evidence of lunar Fe(3 +) phases was not obtained, an upper limit was estimated from different portions of the Moessbauer spectra to be between 0. 1 and 0. 4 wt. % (as Fe 3 O 4). A smaller than 62 microns fraction of 15021, 118 showed 0. 5 wt. % ferromagnetic iron at 300 K in as-returned condition. After heating to 650 C in an evacuated, sealed quartz tube for 1400 hours, the same sample exhibited 1 wt. % ferromagnetic iron at room temperature. An accompanying decrease in excess absorption area near zero velocity was noted. Thus, the result of the vacuum heat treatment was to convert <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>iron</b> to larger particles, apparently without the oxidation effects commonly reported...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{features}} of mechanical behaviour of ultra <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>iron</b> subjected to friction treatment with nitriding (FN) were clarified {{by comparison with}} that induced by friction treatment (FT) with air. Mechanical parameters such as Young?s modulus, nanohardness, and plasticity characteristic ?A {{were found to be}} of high sensitive both to the scale of grain structure and to iron modification by nitrogen. Young?s modulus tends to decrease and Hall-Petch low fails to describe correlation between grain structure and hardness for submicro-grained and nanocrystalline iron. Hall-Petch coefficient, ky, decreases as grain size decreases within submicro-grained and, then, nano grained sections and it takes even negative value in nano grained section modified by nitrogen. Parameter ?A is found to be dependent on combination of hardness and Young?s modulus, resulting in its variation with decreasing the grain size. The presence of secondary nanocrystalline Fe 4 N phase fundamentally changes mechanical behaviour of nanocrystalline iron, leading to strengthening the grain boundaries and triple junctions...|$|E

40|$|This {{review is}} {{concerned}} with the application of ferrous pyrometallurgy to the beneficiation and comprehensive utilization of rare earth ores enriched in iron and other valuable metals such as niobium of which a large number of such deposits exist and are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Russia and USA. Due to the complex mineralogical and textural characteristics and very fine grain size of the minerals, these ores are refractory to conventional mineral beneficiation processes. Pyrometallurgical processes typically used in the beneficiation of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>iron</b> ores may solve these problems. The largest deposit of this kind and the supplier to over 90 % of the world&# 039;s rare earths is the Bayan Obo Fe-REE-Nb deposit of Inner Mongolia, China. This deposit has had the most research conducted regarding pyrometallurgical processing as a means to beneficiate the contained iron and rare earth metal values. A detailed case study is presented of the research carried out to date on the application ferrous pyrometallurgy for the comprehensive utilization of Bayan Obo ore and the applicability of these processes to the beneficiation of similar ore deposits outside of China is considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{dewatering}} of {{iron ore}} concentrates requires large capacity {{in addition to}} producing a cake with low moisture content. Such large processes are commonly energy intensive and means to lower the specific energy consumption are needed. Ceramic capillary action disc filters incorporate a novel filter medium enabling the harnessing of capillary action, which results in decreased energy consumption in comparison to traditional filtration technologies. As another benefit, the filter medium is mechanically and chemically more durable than, for example, filter cloths and can, thus, withstand harsh operating conditions and possible regeneration better than other types of filter media. In iron ore dewatering, the regeneration of the filter medium is done {{through a combination of}} several techniques: (1) backwashing, (2) ultrasonic cleaning, and (3) acid regeneration. Although it is commonly acknowledged that the filter medium is affected by slurry particles and extraneous compounds, published research, especially in the field of dewatering of mineral concentrates, is scarce. Whereas the regenerative effect of backwashing and ultrasound are more or less mechanical, regeneration with acids is based on chemistry. The chemistry behind the acid regeneration is, naturally, dissolution. The dissolution of iron oxide particles has been extensively studied over several decades but those studies may not necessarily be directly applicable in the regeneration of the filter medium which has undergone interactions with the slurry components. The aim of this thesis was to investigate if free particle dissolution indeed correlates with the regeneration of the filter medium. For this purpose, both free particle dissolution and dissolution of surface adhered particles were studied. The focus was on acidic dissolution of iron oxide particles and on the study of the ceramic filter medium used in the dewatering of iron ore concentrates. The free particle dissolution experiments show that the solubility of synthetic <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> <b>iron</b> oxide particles in oxalic acid could be explained through linear models accounting for the effects of temperature and acid concentration, whereas the dissolution of a natural magnetite is not so easily explained by such models. In addition, the kinetic experiments performed both support and contradict the work of previous authors: the suitable kinetic model here supports previous research suggesting solid state reduction to be the reaction mechanism of hematite dissolution but the formation of a stable iron oxalate is not supported by the results of this research. Several other dissolution mechanisms have also been suggested for iron oxide dissolution in oxalic acid, indicating that the details of oxalate promoted reductive dissolution are not yet agreed and, in this respect, this research offers added value to the community. The results of the regeneration experiments with the ceramic filter media show that oxalic acid is highly effective in removing iron oxide particles {{from the surface of the}} filter medium. The dissolution of those particles did not, however, exhibit the expected behaviour, i. e. complete dissolution. The results of this thesis show that although the regeneration of the ceramic filter medium with acids incorporates the dissolution of slurry particles from the surface of the filter medium, the regeneration cannot be assessed purely based upon free particle dissolution. A steady state, dependent on temperature and on the acid concentration, was observed in the dissolution of particles from the surface even though the limit of solubility of free iron oxide particles had not been reached. Both the regeneration capacity and efficiency, with regards to the removal of iron oxide particles, was found to be temperature dependent, but was not affected by the acid concentration. This observation further suggests that the removal of the surface adhered particles does not follow the dissolution of free particles, which do exhibit a dependency on the acid concentration. In addition, changes in the permeability and in the pore structure of the filter medium were still observed after the bulk concentration of dissolved iron had reached a steady state. Consequently, the regeneration of the filter medium continued after the dissolution of particles from the surface had ceased. This observation suggests that internal changes take place at the final stages of regeneration. The regeneration process could, in theory, be divided into two, possibly overlapping, stages: (1) dissolution of surface-adhered particles, and (2) dissolution of extraneous compounds from within the pore structure. In addition to the fundamental knowledge generated during this thesis, tools to assess the effects of parameters on the regeneration of the ceramic filter medium are needed. It has become clear that the same tools used to estimate the dissolution of free particles cannot be used to estimate the regeneration of a filter medium unless only a robust characterisation of the order of regeneration efficiency is needed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLow cycle fatigue {{behavior}} of single phase polycrystalline aluminium and copper {{has been investigated}} under completely reversed strain-control condition. In both cases two different grain sizes have been considered. It is found that over the range of strain amplitude of 0. 20 to 1. 0 pct the cyclic life is low in case of coarse grained aluminium as compared to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> condition. However, the cyclic stress response of coarse grained aluminium is completely {{different from that of}} <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> condition. In contrast to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> aluminium cyclic hardening of coarse grained aluminium is found to occur in different stages for all strain amplitudes. The initial hardening is first stabilized and then increases by substantial amount. On the other hand, although the nature of variation of cyclic stress response with number of cycles is almost similar for both <b>fine</b> and coarse <b>grained</b> copper, the magnitude of hardening all through the cyclic life is more in case of coarse grained copper. This is attributed to higher twin density in case of coarse grained copper. However, the cyclic life in coarse grained copper is less as compared to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> copper.

A review of theoretical and experimental investigations of aerodynamics of the fluidized bed is given, with a special insight into two-component fluidized beds, as well as the basics of heat and material transfer through a fluidized bed. Apart from the theoretical basis of convective drying of wet materials in a stagnant fluidized bed, the paper also emphasizes different approaches to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material drying kinetics. Based on the experimental investigations, where zealots used as a representative of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material and polyethylene as a representative of inert material (another component), an analysis of the influence of working parameters on drying in a two-component fluidized bed is performed. It is established that, apart from the influence of the considered parameters, such as fluidization velocity, diameter of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material particles and drying agent temperature, on the drying curve, the participation of inert material can considerably increase the intensity of heat and material transfer in the fluidized bed.
