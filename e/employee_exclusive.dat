50|$|Labor {{organizations}} play {{an important}} role in the wage determination process by providing representatives at all levels of the wage determination process. The employee unions having the greatest number of wage <b>employees</b> under <b>exclusive</b> recognition designate two of the five members of a lead agency's national level wage committee. Locally, the union with the most <b>employees</b> under <b>exclusive</b> recognition in a wage area designates one of the three members of each Local Wage Survey Committee. In addition, labor organizations nominate half of the Federal employees who collect wage data from private enterprise employers. A partnership team of one labor data collector and one management data collector visits each surveyed employer.|$|R
40|$|Talent {{management}} is an organization’s line of life: It is of vital importance to organizational viability and business success. In {{a majority of}} organizations, talent management aims at maximizing organizational profits by selectively investing in {{a small group of}} high-performing, high-potential <b>employees</b> (<b>exclusive</b> approach). In recent years, however, interest in an alternative, more inclusive approach to talent management has been growing because broad investments in talent development across the workforce are deemed effective in enhancing overall employee well-being. While both approaches bring about certain advantages and disadvantages, inclusive talent {{management is}} a particularly timely response to pressing issues such as the overall talent scarcity, the hard-to-predict market dynamics, and the trend towards more inclusive human resource management...|$|R
50|$|The First Circuit {{affirmed the}} {{decision}} of the lower court. The court had no jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order granting the employee's motion to strike the affirmative defense under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. §§ 1-16. The court affirmed the denial of the employer's motion to stay and to compel arbitration. Enforcement of the arbitration policy was not appropriate because the e-mail did not provide minimally sufficient notice to a reasonably prudent employee of the contractual nature of the e-mailed policy and the concomitant waiver of the employee's right to access a judicial forum. The court held that the mass e-mail, which did not require an affirmative response but requested the recipient to review the materials, was not a traditional means for conveying contractually binding terms of employment and did not state directly that the policy contained a mandatory arbitration agreement that would become the <b>employee's</b> <b>exclusive</b> remedy for all claims.|$|R
50|$|It {{is up to}} the {{temporary}} employee to keep in constant contact with the agency when not currently working on an assignment; by letting the agency know that they are available to work they are given priority over those who may be in the agency database who have not {{made it clear that they}} are ready and willing to take an assignment. A temp agency <b>employee</b> is the <b>exclusive</b> <b>employee</b> of the agency, not of the company in which they are placed (although subject to legal dispute). The temporary employee is bound by the rules and regulations of the client firm, even if they contrast with those of the company in which they are placed.|$|R

5000|$|Barrett's primary {{accomplishment}} {{in office}} was to reform Manitoba's labour laws, reversing {{many of the}} decisions made by the right-wing government of Gary Filmon during the 1990s. Her reform legislation, introduced in July 2000, made union certification automatic if 65% of employees sign membership cards, allowed interim certifications, ensured that employees would not be fired for convictions involving minor offenses, and gave <b>employees</b> the <b>exclusive</b> right to approve or reject arbitration if a labour dispute dragged on more than sixty days. [...] Barrett argued that the changes were necessary to correct a decade of imbalance under the previous government. [...] The bill was met with intense opposition from the business community and, in response to criticism, Barrett changed the bill to give either party in a labour dispute the right to call for binding arbitration after sixty days. [...] Barrett also allowed parents to take more time off work {{after the birth of}} their children, and increased Manitoba's minimum wage by 25 cents for every year of her tenure in office.|$|R

50|$|The {{protection}} under the fourth Amendment is not unlimited. For example, in O'Connor v. Ortega, the officials at a State Hospital, after placing Dr. Magno Ortega on administrative leave pending an investigation into possible workplace improprieties, searched his office. Dr. Ortega filed an action against the hospital alleging that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The district court found that the search was proper, but on appeal the circuit court found that the search did violate Dr. Ortega’s Fourth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court disagreed with both the lower courts. The Courts's decision was based on consideration of two factors (i) whether Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (ii) whether the search of Dr. Ortega's office was reasonable. The Court held that because Dr. Ortega had a private office, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. But, the Court also found the search of his office to be reasonable because it was work-related. The government’s need to ensure efficient operation of the workplace outweighs an employee’s expectation of privacy, even if the privacy expectation is reasonable. Since work environments vary, a public-sector employee’s expectation of privacy must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors the Court considered included (i) notice to <b>employees,</b> (ii) <b>exclusive</b> possession by an employee of keys to a desk or file cabinet, (iii) the government’s need for access to documents, and (iv) the government’s need to protect records and property.|$|R
