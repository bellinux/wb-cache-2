5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone {{has a duty to}} not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
25|$|More intuitively, we can {{say that}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get all the f(x) values to stay in some small {{neighborhood}} around f(x0), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the x values around x0. If we can do that no matter how small the f(x) neighborhood is, then f is continuous atnbsp&x0.|$|E

25|$|The semilattice part of {{the result}} above is {{achieved}} via an infinitary semilattice-theoretical statement URP (Uniform Refinement Property). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> disprove Schmidt's problem, the idea is (1) to prove that any generalized Boolean semilattice satisfies URP (which is easy), (2) that URP is preserved under homomorphic image under a weakly distributive homomorphism (which is also easy), and (3) that there exists a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ2 that does not satisfy URP (which is difficult, and uses Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem).|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fix {{the value}} of n prior to the {{experiment}} {{then we have to}} take the balls one by one until we have n balls. The balls are therefore no longer independent. This gives a slightly different distribution known as Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution. It is far from obvious why these two distributions are different. See the entry for noncentral hypergeometric distributions for an explanation of the difference between these two distributions and a discussion of which distribution to use in various situations.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe in {{the reality of the}} phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|E

500|$|The bombing came {{five days}} after the {{beginning}} of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA's opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA's own terms. According to historian Richard English: [...] "What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, 'We can still return to war <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> We can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore {{you have to deal with}} us'".|$|E

This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.|$|E

We all {{should be able to}} play poker on the Web <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> and I believe that making it illegal strips us of our rights. This is an important issue, and hopefully we'll see it resolved soon." [...] Outside of poker, Cada also plays indoor soccer. , he was considering purchasing a second home in Las Vegas, Nevada and possibly opening a bar.|$|E
500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use it.

[...] Some rumors regarding a sequel arose due to casting calls for voice actors. On March 10, 2010, Portal 2 was officially announced for a release late in that year; the announcement was preceded by an alternate reality game based on unexpected patches made to Portal that contained cryptic messages in relation to Portal 2s announcement, including an update to the game, creating a different ending for the fate of Chell. The original game left her in a deserted car park after destroying GLaDOS, but the update involved Chell being dragged back into the facility by a [...] "Party Escort Bot". Though Portal 2 was originally announced for a Q4 2010 release, the game was released on April 19, 2011.|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

Imran Khan, a popular opposition politician and former cricketer {{who has been a}} long-time staunch critic of the government's foreign policy and its decision to join the American-led War on Terror, called the attack unpardonable during a political rally in Multan, and said the Pakistani government had wasted $70 billion belonging to the Pakistani people, as well as the lives of 40,000 people, on fighting a counter-productive American war: [...] "I know that the government will not do anything except issue some silly comments against brutality even after this attack. I do not issue comments, I believe in taking action." [...] An Awami National Party politician and senator called the incident a terrorist attack. Awami Muslim League party leader Sheikh Rashid Ahmed supported a blockade of NATO supplies [...] "to teach an unforgettable lesson to USA and NATO forces for violating Pakistani soil." [...] MQM chief Altaf Hussain condemned the attack and directed his party to observe a [...] "Stability and Solidarity Day". Former president Pervez Musharraf heavily criticised the attack while giving a telephonic conference to the Karachi Press Club and advised the government to take strict measures at a diplomatic level. Many other leaders also called on the government {{to pull out of the}} war in Afghanistan and disassociate itself from the U.S. alliance. The JUI called the attack a [...] "shameful incident" [...] and [...] "a slap across the face of Pakistani foreign policy" [...] adopted by rulers who [...] "always bow before their foreign masters." [...] Protesters affiliated with the right-wing Jamaat-ud-Dawa held a rally outside the Lahore Press Club where they urged the Pakistan Army to give a [...] "befitting response" [...] to NATO; the leader of the party said [...] "We have to eliminate all stations and bases given to the CIA <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end terrorism in Pakistan".|$|E
