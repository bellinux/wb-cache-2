Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for <b>intussusception,</b> a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Internal rectal <b>intussusception</b> (rectal <b>intussusception,</b> {{internal}} <b>intussusception,</b> internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal procidentia and rectal invagination) is {{a medical}} condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the rectal wall that can occur during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} {{internal}} rectal <b>intussusception</b> represents the initial {{form of a}} progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of <b>intussusception.</b> However, internal <b>intussusception</b> rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse. The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal <b>intussusception</b> to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal <b>intussusception</b> are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising {{the possibility that it}} represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.|$|E

40|$|Background: Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} hereditary disorder characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and typical pigment lesions. It is a rare cause of multiple <b>intussusceptions.</b> Previous studies on Peutz-Jeghers syndrome reported only one case of multiple <b>intussusceptions.</b> We describe a case of appendiceal and multiple small intestine <b>intussusceptions</b> presenting as peritonitis in a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Case Presentation:A 17 -year-old girl presented with an 8 day history of a sharp, non-radiating periumbilical pain. She underwent surgery with the diagnosis of peritonitis. Intraoperative findings included appendiceal and multiple small intestine <b>intussusceptions.</b> The final pathological evaluation of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Conclusion:Multiple <b>intussusceptions</b> may occur as the primary manifestation of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Because of its complications, {{in view of the}} presence of multiple polyps, early intervention is strongly recommended...|$|R
25|$|Others {{argue that}} the {{majority}} of patients appear to have rectal <b>intussusception</b> as a consequence of obstructed defecation rather than a cause, possibly related to excessive straining in patients with obstructed defecation. Patients with other causes of obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction) like anismus also tend to have higher incidence of internal <b>intussusception.</b> Enteroceles are coexistent in 11% of patients with internal <b>intussusception.</b> Symptoms of internal <b>intussusception</b> overlap with those of rectocele, indeed the 2 conditions can occur together.|$|E
25|$|Recto-rectal (high) <b>intussusception</b> (intra-rectal <b>intussusception)</b> {{is where}} the <b>intussusception</b> starts in the rectum, does not {{protrude}} into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower sigmoid.|$|E
25|$|Solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) {{occurs with}} internal rectal <b>intussusception</b> and {{is part of}} the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions. It describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal <b>intussusception</b> is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal <b>intussusception,</b> which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.|$|E
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) may metastasize {{to almost any}} organ, but metastasis to the small bowel is rare. Small bowel metastasis from RCC can induce obstruction or bleeding, and perforation can also be induced in rare case. Yet RCC metastasis to the small bowel {{is unlikely to be}} a direct cause of <b>intussusceptions.</b> A few cases of <b>intussusceptions</b> caused by small intestinal metastasis of RCC have been reported, but multiple small intestinal <b>intussusceptions</b> are extremely rare. We report here on a 47 -year-old male patient who presented to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain. He had undergone radical nephrectomy 2 years previously due to left RCC. The abdominal CT scan revealed enhanced masses with the "target" sign that suggested enteric <b>intussusceptions</b> in the jejunum. Eight pedunculated masses within the small intestinal lumen led to <b>intussusceptions</b> at 30 and 150 cm distal to Treitz ligament. Three segmental resections of the small intestine and functional end to end anastomosis were done. The patient recovered uneventfully from this operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1 st report of metastases from RCC that presented as synchronous intraluminal polypoid tumors, and these tumors served as the lead points for two <b>intussusceptions</b> in the jejunum...|$|R

The occurrence of intus-susceptions in adults is rare, accounting for less than 5 % of all cases of <b>intussusceptions</b> and almost 1 %- 5 % of bowel obstruction [2]. In contrast to pediatric intussus-ceptions, which is idiopathic in 90 % of cases, adult intus-susceptions has an organic lesion in 70 % to 90 % of cases [3]. The majority of lipomas in the small bowel are solitary. Approximately 5 % are multiple [4]. Symptom-atic lipoma manifestations are hemorrhage or intestinal obstruction.

25|$|Patients with solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} {{combined with}} internal <b>intussusception</b> (as 94% of SRUS patients have) {{were shown to}} have altered rectal wall biomechanics {{compared to patients with}} internal <b>intussusception</b> alone. The presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, occluding the rectal lumen during attempted defecation. One study analysed resected rectal wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal <b>intussusception</b> undergoing stapled trans-anal rectal resection. They reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors. One study concluded that <b>intussusception</b> of the anterior rectal wall shares the same cause as rectocele, namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role and}} efficacy of laparoscopic reduction of <b>intussusceptions</b> in children with failed initial hydrostatic reductions. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of children who underwent laparoscopy for incomplete reductions following sonoguided hydrostatic reduction. Laparoscopy guided pneumatic reduction or laparoscopic reduction was done. Results: Hydrostatic reduction was successful in 76 (73. 5 %) of cases. Among 26 children in Laparoscopy group 8 showed completeness of reduction. Features of necrotic bowel were seen in 4 (15 %) children requiring laparotomy. Among 14 children with incomplete reduction 3 (21 %) children required pneumatic reduction under laparoscopic monitoring. 11 required laparoscopic reduction. None of the incomplete group with viable bowel required conversion to open surgery. No major complications were noted in any groups. The mean hospital stay was 1. 8 days in hydrostatic group 4. 2 days in laparoscopic group and 6. 8 days in laparotomy group. No recurrence of <b>intussusceptions</b> noted. Conclusions: The role of laparoscopy in <b>intussusceptions</b> is evolving as a safe procedure and helps in avoiding laparotomy in large number of children with incomplete reduction. Non operative reduction is the gold standard in management of <b>intussusceptions</b> in children. Excellent results are obtained with either saline or pneumatic reductions. However, in few cases of, incomplete reduction or doubtful complete reduction with non operative technique poses problem for further management and may need laparotomy. Laparoscopy being less invasive has distinct advantage over open laparotomy. Use of Laparoscopy {{in the management of}} <b>Intussusceptions</b> is described in literature.

25|$|The mode of {{formation}} of the cell wall was controversial in the 19th century. Hugo von Mohl (1853, 1858) advocated {{the idea that the}} cell wall grows by apposition. Carl Nägeli (1858, 1862, 1863) believed that the growth of the wall in thickness and in area was due to a process termed <b>intussusception.</b> Each theory was improved in the following decades: the apposition (or lamination) theory by Eduard Strasburger (1882, 1889), and the <b>intussusception</b> theory by Julius Wiesner (1886).|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential <b>intussusception</b> of the rectum, which slowly increases over time.
