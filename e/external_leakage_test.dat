40|$|AbstractThe {{testing of}} {{assemblies}} {{for use in}} cryogenic systems commonly includes evaluation at or near operating (therefore cryogenic) temperature. Typical assemblies include valves and pumps for use in liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen rocket engines. One frequently specified method of cryogenic <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> requires the assembly, pressurized with gaseous helium (GHe), be immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (LN 2) and allowed to thermally stabilize. Component interfaces are then visually inspected for leakage (bubbles). Unfortunately the liquid nitrogen will be boiling under normal, bench-top, test conditions. This boiling tends to mask even significant leakage. One little known and perhaps under-utilized property of helium is the seemingly counter-intuitive thermodynamic property that when ambient temperature helium is bubbled through boiling LN 2 at a temperature of − 195. 8 °C, {{the temperature of the}} liquid nitrogen will reduce. This paper reports on the design and testing of a novel proof-of-concept helium injection control system confirming {{that it is possible to}} reduce the temperature of an LN 2 bath below boiling point through the controlled injection of ambient temperature gaseous helium and then to efficiently maintain a reduced helium flow rate to maintain a stabilized liquid temperature, enabling clear visual observation of components immersed within the LN 2.

In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planova™ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution.

Sample discs were tested in a flow rig designed to measure the pressure drop across the discs. Using filtered, degassed water at a flow rate of 1. 4  µl/min repeated flow measurements were taken (n= 6) for each disc. After flow testing, all discs were imaged using a scanning electron microscope and the dimensions of each hole were derived using image analysis software. In the <b>external</b> <b>leakage</b> study, corneoscleral buttons (n= 13) were prepared from cadaver pig eyes and mounted on an artificial anterior chamber infused with Tyrode solution. After the pressure had stabilised, standard occluded silicone tube implants were inserted through 23  gauge needle stab incisions at the limbus. These were compared against prototype PMMA implants with a novel shape profile inserted through 1. 15  mm width microvitreoretinal (MVR) stab incisions at the limbus. The infusion rate was maintained and a second pressure measurement was taken when the pressure had stabilised. The difference {{between the first and}} second pressure measurement was then compared, as an index of <b>external</b> <b>leakage.</b>  RESULTS—Ablated tubes were found to have a near perfect circular outline on both the entry and exit side. The observed pressure drops across the ablated sample discs at each target diameter were as follows: 10  µm, mean 25. 66  (SD 4. 9) mm Hg; 15  µm, 6. 7  (1. 15); 20  µm, 1. 66  (1. 07); and 25  µm, 0. 1).  CONCLUSIONS—It was shown that it is possible, in principle, to control the dimensions of a manufactured tubular lumen in a glaucoma drainage device accurately enough to provide consistent protection from hypotony in the early period after glaucoma filtration surgery. By redesigning the external profile of glaucoma drainage device and incision technique, it was also shown that it is possible to eliminate uncontrolled <b>external</b> <b>leakage.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This Master`s Thesis {{deal with}} {{integrity}} and barrier philosophy. A special {{focus has been}} on internal leakage through barrier elements. There is an increasing discussion about what a primary and secondary barrier is, how many barriers there should be, their permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria and their integrity. Subsea Christmas tree (XMT) is considered as a pressure barrier element in subsea production systems. Rules and regulations require frequent <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of subsea XMT valves. Applicable standards include NORSOK D- 010, ISO 10423 and 13628 - 4 and API RP 14 B. Due to the remoteness, of the subsea well head, testing is more complicated compared to testing of platform trees (dry trees). Applicable standards specify a maximum permitted leakage rate. However, when considering testing of valves using small fluid test volume the model has limitations. A challenge is to determine if the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> criteria are fulfilled or not. Leak testing of subsea XMT valves is an engineering challenge. Engineers must meet leak rate standards as well as they have to understand all aspects of the leak testing procedure. Operators address a {{question of whether or not}} their correlation tool of pressure to leak rate is accurate enough. Another question regards the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B; how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes – typical XMT volumes. By this Master`s Thesis, an issue that does not have an ideal solution today is highlighted. The issue that operating companies faces is: In questionable situations whether a valve has fulfilled the criteria or not – how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes, how to decide whether a XMT have to be pulled, how to increase planning security, how to save money, time and estimate the lifetime of different valves on the XMT. The problems that the Operating Company meet regarding <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of XMT valves may be that the differential pressure across the valve is lost in a couple of minutes. This questions the leak test procedure; is the permitted leak rate acceptance criteria or the test interval too large? To be on the safe side when evaluating <b>leakage</b> <b>tests,</b> the Operating Company has included new permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria into their work procedures. Service personnel fear that such a strict acceptance criteria can result in an unmanageable situation with a numerous of exceptions. Another problem that may be faced is that there is no procedure of when to initiate the <b>leakage</b> <b>test.</b> This results in difficulties in comparing historical and recent <b>leakage</b> <b>tests.</b> Also, this can result in a <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> that shows a smaller leakage than it actually do. Data from previous <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> of production Master – and –Wing valve on the XMT are collected. The data are used to evaluate today`s procedure of <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> and for correlating pressure to leak rate. Both, the new internal leakage acceptance criteria that the Operating Company uses and the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B are evaluated. Today, a basic tool for correlating pressure to acceptable leak rate exists. From the technical advisors point of view it is desirable with a more accurate software tool that can correlate pressure to leak rate. To evaluate today`s practice of correlating pressure to leak rate the MultiProScale simulation tool is used. It is assumed that the simulation tool correlates the most correct leak rate due to the complexity of the simulation tool. However, this Master`s Thesis shows that such a powerful tool is not needed for correlating pressure to leak rate. Based on this Master`s Thesis, the contribution to the <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> procedure is an improved calculation tool of correlating pressure, temperature and compressibility changes to actual leak rate. A presentation of this Master`s Thesis is presented for the Technical advisor of Well Technology, Hilde Brandanger Haga at Statoil. She agreed with the challenges and solutions that were presented. The improved calculation tool was also introduced. A proposal was presented that not only could the calculation tool be used onshore, but it could be used to show the actual leak rate during <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of the PMV and PWV offshore. The advantage with this tool is that it can ensure the competence, it helps the decision-making process, it increases planning, it decreases cost and safeguard barriers. Other contributions are recommended changes both to the leak testing procedure and the data documentation. In relation to both of the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria, the main conclusions are: To apply the internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API 14 B to the subsea XMT, the leakage time interval have to be reduced from 10 – to 2 minutes. This will not result in an increased number of valves that does not fulfill the acceptance criteria. Or to apply the acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B, the test volume has to be > 50 liters. And, the additional internal leakage acceptance criteria that are implemented by the Operating Company are stricter than the one governed by API RP 14 B. A decrease in time interval from 10 – to 2 minutes gives an increased number of valves that do not fulfill the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria. </p...|$|R

40|$|Wind-driven air {{infiltration}} {{has been recognized}} among the major reasons for energy loss in buildings, and the impact to energy efficiency under steady conditions has been reported and issued as part of many building codes. The nearly zero-energy building demand makes uncontrolled leakage paths even more undesired and creates {{the need for further}} investigation of their behavior under unsteady wind conditions. The present numerical study examines the role of wind gustiness on instantaneous infiltration rates of a low-rise building. For this purpose, two levels of gust frequency Ω have been simulated, expressed as a sinusoidal factor in the wind profile formula. In parallel, a ratio α is employed to represent seven different cases of <b>external</b> <b>leakages</b> distribution, while five scenarios of compartmentalization and internal leakages shows the impact of the latter on the dynamics of building air exchange rates.
