500|$|M-69 {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of 5th Street and Superior Avenue in Crystal Falls, where it meets US2/US141. The Iron County Courthouse is located at the head of Superior Avenue and overlooks a steep hill headed east through downtown. The City of Crystal Falls states that the courthouse offers [...] "a view of the main street of the City and the scenic panorama of the valley at its feet". On a clear day, Iron Mountain {{can be seen from the}} courthouse tower. It is from this starting point that M-69 descends Superior Avenue through downtown toward the Paint River in Iron County. The highway crosses the river on a historic bridge built in 1929 that features <b>decorative</b> <b>lamp</b> posts and railings. The bridge was rehabilitated for five months in 2002. This rehabilitation involved replacing the bridge deck, repairing the bridge's substructure, and restoring the lighting and railings to original designs. Because this bridge is listed on Michigan's list of historic bridges, the construction work had to preserve the original historic character of the bridge. Final construction was completed at a cost of $1,130,545 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). A complete bridge replacement would have cost 25% more without saving the historic bridge.|$|E

5000|$|The {{work was}} decided {{to be done in}} two stage, desilting was done on large scale along with removal of Lotus plants and other waste from lake. The work {{included}} repairing of Eastern side guard wall of lake, construction of path way with granite stone paving, widening of 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., road side guard wall and landscaping berms, parking and garden bays on other side of road, fixing <b>decorative</b> <b>lamp,</b> benches, attractive dust bins etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, sprinkler system was provided. For sufficient lighting purpose, four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of lake. Two colored fountains of 15 feet and one white and fountain of 100 feet, as such total three floating fountains were set up in lake [...] The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on South side and guard wall of lake with sand beach on North side was also done in the same phase.|$|E

50|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{historical}} north elevation of Woolwich High Street. Even the relatively new Waterfront Leisure Centre has been designated for demolition. On the south side, a chaotic picture is created by two clusters of small, mostly run-down shops, a garage complex and a cinema which {{is by far the}} largest building here. The former Granada Cinema of 1936-37 is used as a Pentecostal church. It has some of the most lavish cinema interiors in London. The adjacent shop fronts (Woolwich High Street nos. 131-132) are probably from the early 19th century, perhaps built after the road-widening around 1810. Furlongs Garage occupies the site of the Dog Yard brewery, established by John Hare in the 1730s. This ambitious brick-clad garage complex dates from 1938-39. It was said to be the largest motoring complex in south-east London at the time. It comprises a four-storey garage with a ramp, linked to a smaller building by a high-level bridge over Mortgramit Square. Originally it also featured showrooms on Powis Street. The largely 1950s High Street frontage includes a filling station, a carwash and shops. To its east is a group of three, originally four Georgian shop-houses (nos. 121-123), all with M-shaped gambrel roofs. The fourth house, next to Furlongs, was demolished in 1994, after which the shops were given new frontages. The Coopers' Arms, also Plaisted's Wine House (no. 120), is a pub established around 1740 by John Hare, whose brewery stood nearby. The current neo-Georgian building dates from 1929-30. The <b>decorative</b> <b>lamp</b> is probably older. Plaisted's is separated from the corner building on Hare Street by a narrow alley that leads to a part of Mortgramit Square previously known as Dog Yard. The large cornershop was built for Burton's in 1929 with neo-Egyptian detailing. It is now a restaurant with a nightclub above. The original shopfront, mostly on Hare Street, survives behind bright yellow shuttering.|$|E

40|$|Product {{language}} is {{the set of}} stylistic, aesthetic and design traits of a product specifically aimed at conveying users the meaning of that product. Thus when a technology breakthrough occurs firms are faced by the fundamental challenge of developing an appropriate new product language to mark the new technology and highlight its new features and capabilities to create value for user. Nevertheless {{the dynamics of the}} product language evolution in the early phases of a technology breakthrough are still poorly understood. The paper analyses the launch and the early years (2007 - 2011) of the LED-based products in the Italian <b>decorative</b> <b>lamp</b> industry. Using the network graph analysis the paper highlights the product language’s evolutionary dynamics of these products and based on existing theories speculates on the drivers of such dynamics. In particular three main factors seem to affect the early evolution of the product language of a breakthrough technology: (i) the users lock-in created by the early product language experimentations, (ii) the collective mechanisms that firms adopt when they develop new product languages (so called design discourse) and (iii) the influence of past product language solutions on the interplay between problem space and solution space in defining new developments. Implications for mangers of the study’s findings are discussed...|$|E

25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small <b>decorative</b> <b>lamps,</b> and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|R

2500|$|Around 1917, Daniel McFarlan Moore, {{then working}} at the General Electric Company, {{developed}} the miniature neon lamp. The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, [...] "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [...] "coronal discharge." [...] Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful <b>decorative</b> <b>lamps.</b> Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s." ...|$|R

50|$|Chalkware is an American {{term for}} popular figurines either made of moulded plaster of Paris (usually) or sculpted gypsum, and painted, {{typically}} with oils or watercolors. They were primarily created {{during one of}} three periods: from the late 18th century {{to the beginning of}} the 20th century, during the Great Depression, and during the 'mid-century modern' era as <b>decorative</b> <b>lamps,</b> figurines and wall decor from the 1940s-1960s. Those created during the earlier period were intended as a more serious decorative art, often imitating the more expensive imported English Staffordshire potteries figurines such as Staffordshire dog figurines; those during the second period, by contrast, were more typically somewhat jocular. Early chalkware was often hollow and is difficult to find unblemished.|$|R
