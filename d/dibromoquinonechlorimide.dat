2500|$|Phosphatase {{denaturing}} {{was originally}} monitored using a phenol-phosphate substrate. When hydrolysed by the enzyme these compounds liberate phenols, {{which were then}} reacted with <b>dibromoquinonechlorimide</b> to give a colour change, which itself was measured by checking absorption at 610nm (spectrophotometry). Some of the phenols used were inherently coloured (phenolpthalein, nitrophenol) and were simply assayed unreacted. [...] Spectrophotometric analysis is satisfactory but is of relatively low accuracy because many natural products are coloured. For this reason, modern systems (since 1990) use fluorometry which is able to detect much lower levels of raw milk contamination.|$|E
