The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E

These sets are decorated with props evocative of feudal-era aristocrats, such as kimono and armor, personally chosen by Mizoguchi. The scene where the protagonists travel through Lake Biwa on a boat was in fact shot on a pool in the studio, with added smoke.

5|$|Mara {{replaced}} Gibson as the team's president {{before the}} 1927 season. He told March to spend whatever he felt necessary {{to build a}} championship caliber team. March overhauled the roster and the team finished 11–1–1, while winning its first NFL championship. They barely broke even financially however, and the team was still giving away as many as 4,000 tickets a game. Mara decided to reduce costs the following season, and instead of traveling first class, the Giants drove to games in a used bus, and stayed at local YMCAs instead of hotels. The team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the bus once for several miles when it broke down, and players had trouble sleeping at the Y. They won only four games, and Mara lost $40,000.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take it easy to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

25|$|During Charlotte's {{lifetime}} {{friends and}} sponsors visited the parsonage, including Sir James and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, Ellen Nussey, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Store Smith, a young writer from Manchester, Bessie Parkes, who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and Abraham Holroyd, poet, antiquarian, and historian. However, following {{the publication of}} the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte's husband.|$|E
500|$|A new visual for the song, {{directed}} by Sophia Peer, was shot on December 2 {{of that year}} in Franklin, Tennessee. Peer stated that she wanted the video to [...] "reflect" [...] the message she retained from the song—"you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> yourself out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself". She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual, and she talked to Alexandra Young and the video's editor Winston Case, who suggested her the concept of breaking world records. Peer selected 30 records for the band to break, nonetheless, they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot. The records selected were picked to match [...] "different sections of the song" [...] and were based on other already-existent records.|$|E

He commented that [...] "It's probably the hardest stuff he's ever played {{on one of our}} albums. He had to physically work his way up to it. He had to go running, lift weights, work with a trainer", eventually Bourdon feels that he had become a better drummer {{at the end of each}} day after recording. Shinoda later told Q magazine that Bourdon had to seek help from a chiropractor after he had broken his back recording material for the new album. Shinoda told Q that [...] "Rob was killing himself.

Daavettila responded with his first {{professional}} hockey goal and went on to score 9goals and 9assists in 20games for the Wings that season. During the off-season, the New York Rangers of the NHL invited Daavettila to participate in a development camp for their recent draftees and other prospects. [...] "It was the hardest I've ever <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> myself as far as conditioning and the longevity of it", said Daavettila. Also during the off-season, the Kalamazoo Wings left the IHL to become members of the ECHL, and Daavettila {{was one of the first}} players the team signed to play in their new league. [...] "It was a weird feeling knowing you had a ... plan for next year, somebody actually wants you", he said.|$|E
500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E

So it was [...] "Use our ideas. They're free" [...] Because the song is so different from the first record, we wanted to make a video that was young and fun that kids could relate to. The video idea that was first proposed really was not for a young market. It was a lot older.|$|E

500|$|The trial {{concluded}} with a field trip, as the jury went to view both Brownlee's house and two stretches of road where MacMillan had claimed key encounters took place. [...] Rainy weather meant that {{on more than one}} occasion the jurors and lawyers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> cars out of the mud. [...] Though one road essentially matched MacMillan's description, it was located next to a populated settlement rather than deserted as she had claimed. [...] The other, in contrast to her description of it as a side road, was a busy highway. [...] Upon the jury's return, Smith surprised them by announcing that Brownlee's counter-claim was being dropped; he said that there was no need to complicate the clear cut issue of [...] "seduction or no seduction" [...] with evidence about a conspiracy on the part of MacMillan and Caldwell. [...] Legal historian Patrick Brode criticized this decision, suggesting that the jury was expecting proof of a conspiracy and that, when this proof was not forthcoming, Brownlee's credibility was hurt.|$|E
500|$|Prompted {{in part by}} Salinger's letter, Bakshi briefly {{retired to}} focus on painting. During this time he {{completed}} the screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, [...] "They thought {{that no one was}} going to admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it was too hot, which made no sense." [...] In 1985, he {{received a phone call from}} The Rolling Stones' manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob & Earl's [...] "Harlem Shuffle", and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band's arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi's animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.|$|E
500|$|Spears was {{credited}} with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just {{has to make a}} scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
