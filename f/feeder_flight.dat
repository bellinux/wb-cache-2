Launched with DC-8 equipment routing through Glasgow Prestwick in Scotland, frequency subsequently increased to four flights a week, while the intermediate stop was cut out. Following the introduction in April 1971 of a daily Berlin Tempelhof–Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel–London-Heathrow 727 <b>feeder</b> <b>flight</b> that connected with the airline's transatlantic services at the latter airport, Pan Am withdrew its non-stop Tegel–JFK service {{at the end of}} the summer timetable, in October of that year.|$|E

2500|$|The Clipper Maid of the Seas {{operated}} the transatlantic leg of Flight 103, which had originated at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, on a Boeing 727.

At London Heathrow Airport, passengers and their luggage on the <b>feeder</b> <b>flight</b> transferred directly onto the Boeing 747, along with unaccompanied interline luggage.

[...] Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster, the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{abandonment}} of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing. Demands for such an inquiry have increased since, and become more insistent. On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN {{to find out the}} truth about Pan Am flight 103. [...] "We owe it {{to the families of the}} victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible," [...] McGowan said. Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should [...] "institute a full public inquiry" [...] into the Lockerbie disaster. On 3 October 2009, Malta was asked to table a UN resolution supporting the petition, which was signed by 20 people including the families of the Lockerbie victims, authors, journalists, professors, politicians and parliamentarians, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The signatories considered that a UN inquiry could help remove [...] "many of the deep misgivings which persist in lingering over this tragedy" [...] and could also eliminate Malta from this terrorist act. Malta was brought into the case because the prosecution argued that the two accused Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, had placed the bomb on an Air Malta aircraft before it was transferred at Frankfurt airport to a <b>feeder</b> <b>flight</b> destined for London's Heathrow airport, from which Pan Am Flight 103 departed. The Maltese government responded saying that the demand for a UN inquiry was [...] "an interesting development that would be deeply considered, although there were complex issues surrounding the event." ...|$|E
50|$|In air transport, {{a change}} of gauge for a {{passenger}} or cargo flight is {{a change of}} aircraft while retaining the same flight number.

5000|$|Abdelbaset al-Megrahi {{was convicted}} for the Lockerbie bombing {{on the theory}} that he loaded a bomb onto Air Malta Flight KM180 Malta-Frankfurt at Luqa Airport which it is alleged found its way via the {{interline}} baggage system onto Pan Am <b>Feeder</b> <b>Flight</b> 103A Frankfurt-London and eventually onto Pan Am Flight 103 London -New York.|$|E

40|$|The {{genesis of}} the current process for 100 % checked baggage {{screening}} grew out, as most security measures have, from a joint industry and government response to the terrorist attack on Pan Am flight PA 103 (Pan Am 103) over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December 1988. Prior to this successful attack, screening of checked baggage was limited in both scale and technical ability. Screening tended to be focused almost exclusively on flights categorised as high risk or with a temporary elevated threat due to the carriage of certain high profile passengers. Ironically the baggage destined for Pan Am 103 at Heathrow was screened {{in accordance with the}} United States Federal Aviation Administration regulations at Frankfurt airport by Pan Am’s own security company, Alert, prior to it being loaded on the <b>feeder</b> <b>flight</b> Pan Am 103 A. This was a narrow bodied Boeing 727 with loose loaded baggage in the hold, whereas Pan Am 103 itself was a Boeing 747 with containerised baggage. The baggage screening was carried out at Frankfurt on both originating and transfer baggage, but not when the airline transferred the baggage tail to tail from the Pan Am 103 A to the Pan Am 103 at Heathrow. Unfortunately as we now know, (and probably knew at the time but would not admit) the X-ray technologies used were neither designed nor capable of detecting explosives. The technology was effectively the same as that developed in the mid 1970 s for screening carry-on baggage for weapons used in hijacking of aircraft, which in those days were typically guns or knives, certainly not explosives...|$|E
