5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|English writer Brian Sibley found Travers still gun-shy {{from her}} {{experiences}} with Disney {{when he was}} hired in the 1980s to write a possible Mary Poppins sequel. Sibley reported that Travers told him, [...] "I could only agree <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{it on my own}} terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust." [...] Regardless, while watching the original film together—the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere—she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production, and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she only acquiesced on the condition that English-born writers and no one from the film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development.|$|E

6000|$|With a heavy heart Arthur Berkeley turned homeward {{to his own}} cosy little cottage; that modest {{palace of}} art which he had once hoped little Miss Butterfly might have shared with him. He went up the steps, and turned quickly into his own small study. The Progenitor was there, sitting reading in an easy-chair. 'At least,' Arthur thought to himself, 'I have made HIS old age happy. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> as much for little Miss Butterfly! for little Miss Butterfly! for little Miss Butterfly! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> as much for her, oh, how happy and {{contented}} I should be!' ...|$|R
500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here. As this is {{absolute}} oppression, if I were a bookseller in this town, I would use all the safe means to reprint London books, and run them to any town in England, that I could, because whoever offends not the laws of God, or the country he lives in, commits no sin.... But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{estate of}} Raymond Chandler was {{satisfied}} with Parker's completion of Poodle Springs, a Philip Marlowe novel begun in 1958 by Chandler but finished by Parker for publication in 1989. They authorized him to write this entirely new sequel to the first Marlowe novel, The Big Sleep, originally published in 1939. [...] Parker, a longtime fan and student of Chandler's writing, said he took the assignment because [...] "I wanted to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it". After the publication of Perchance to Dream, Parker announced {{that this would be}} his final Marlowe novel because he did not [...] "want to spend [...] life writing some other guy's books".|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of gigs in London, {{including}} the Speakeasy Club, the band were introduced to Terry King, who became the group's first manager. David Hitchcock, {{who had been working}} in the art department of Decca Records, asked the company's president, Hugh Mendl to sign the band. They began recording their second album, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You (1970) in September 1969, while continuing to gig on the university circuit, and appearing at festivals alongside Pink Floyd, Yes, The Nice and Soft Machine. Recording If I could... continued in February 1970, with the 14-minute track [...] "For Richard", showing the band's contrast in styles and jazz-rock influence. The album was released in August, alongside an appearance at the Plumpton Festival with Van Der Graaf Generator, Yes and Colosseum. The accompanying single [...] "Hello Hello" [...] helped them land an appearance on the TV show Top of the Pops, performing the album's title track.|$|E
