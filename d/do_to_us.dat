[...] While the agency remained vague about the exact meaning of offensive counterintelligence, experts opined that it [...] "could include planting a mole in a foreign intelligence service, passing disinformation to mislead the other side, or even disrupting enemy information systems", suggesting strong overlap between CI and traditional HUMINT operations.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not much," [...] Jim cried with a laugh. [...] "There's Elias Macomber, for example--he's an Englishman, you know, an' hasn't been in {{this country}} more'n four years.

6000|$|... "It won't {{matter to}} Pat, {{but it might}} to the one who goes to her," [...] said Felicity. [...] "She isn't a witch, but she's a spiteful old woman, and {{goodness}} knows what she'd <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> if she caught us. I'm scared of Peg Bowen, and I don't care who knows it.

6000|$|The crowd {{gathered}} around them, still very threatening in attitude, yet clearly afraid to approach within arm's-length of the strangers.

6000|$|Then Sir Tristram catched {{her into}} his arms and he cried out: [...] "Isoult! Isoult! what hast thou <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> both? Was it not enough that I should have been unhappy but that thou shouldst have chosen to be unhappy also?" ...|$|R
6000|$|One day all {{the three}} were sitting resting under a tree, for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking.

So, he loved them all, and was kind and forbearing with them all, and was always pleased to watch them all, and they all honoured and loved him.

Think! In mounting higher, The angels would press on us and aspire To drop some golden orb of perfect song Into our deep, dear silence.
