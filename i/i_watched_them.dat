5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them,</b> turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
60|$|Old {{wall where}} sudden lizards flash. At Charenton <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|From out {{the wood}} <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> shine,-- [...] The {{windows of the}} haunted house, Now ruddy as enchanted wine, [...] Now dark as flittermouse.|$|E
5000|$|Peering through reverent fingers <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> {{flourish}} and fall, ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drift--the {{youthful}} aspirations, Shores, landmarks, beacons, drift alike. [...] . [...] . <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drift--the {{poets and}} the statesmen; The very streams run upward from the sea. [...] . [...] Yet overhead the boundless arch of heaven [...] Still fades to night, still blazes into day. [...] . [...] Ah, God! My God! Thou wilt not drift away ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> ( [...] fields) &rArr; [...] I {{cause them}} ( [...] children) to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> (...) &rArr; [...] <b>I</b> cause <b>them</b> (...) to <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> (...) {{on behalf of}} her ( [...] grandmother, old woman) (highly marked) ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> go. I only {{remember}} myself left there somehow--horribly empty and alone. I sat down again and {{fell into a deep}} shapeless musing.|$|E
60|$|The Irishman and his {{daughter}} also rose, and got out. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> leave stoically. It {{would have been too}} much to expect that they should be going any further.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} well away, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> from the door. They trudged off in the {{direction}} of Moor Farm; and, as it was beginning to get dusk, I soon lost sight of them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drift--the old {{familiar}} faces, Who fished {{and rode}} with me, by stream and wold, Till ghosts, not men, fill old beloved places, And, ah! {{the land is}} rank with churchyard mold.|$|R
6000|$|The step shines wet {{beneath the}} rain, Which prints its circles as heretofore; <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> {{from the porch}} again, But no song-notes within the door [...] Now call to me [...] To shun the {{dripping}} lea [...] And forth I stride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as you {{had planted}} the theory in me, {{it began to}} bear fruit. <b>I</b> began to <b>watch</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> {{continued}} to <b>watch</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> did nothing but watch them." ...|$|R
6000|$|How lovely {{those girls}} {{had seemed to}} me as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> approach, walking so daintily the path beside the fence! What rich, {{alluring}} color flamed in Bettie's cheek, what fire flashed in Aggie's dark and roguish eyes! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> {{start up}} the street with other fugitives who were pouring out of Hastings, {{and came back to}} my mother. As I did so a great shout told me that the French fleet had been sighted.|$|E
60|$|As long as {{the three}} men were in sight <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b> When the last brown speck had flitted and {{disappeared}} far away in the forest I retraced my steps to my mustang, pondering upon this new turn in my affairs.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>'em</b> up the road, {{and then}} I locked {{the gate and}} {{walked up and down}} the wharf {{thinking}} wot a funny thing money is, and 'ow it alters people's natures. And arter all, I thought that three arf-dollars earned honest was better than a reward for hiding another man's dog.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think the}} other does his work for him," [...] Amina said. [...] "He works for me of a morning and then goes into the fields; and when <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> {{to see that they}} are doing their work {{it seems to me that}} he does more than any of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|They drift away--Ah, God! they drift for ever. [...] . [...] <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drift--the old {{familiar}} faces, [...] Till ghosts, not men, fill old beloved places. [...] . [...] Shores, landmarks, beacons drift alike. [...] Yet overhead the boundless arch {{of heaven}} [...] Still fades to night, still blazes into day. Ah, God! My God! Thou wilt not drift away! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a {{child of}} beauty rare! [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> with delight, they were a lovely pair. [...] Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away: [...] 15 [...] But ere ten yards were gone her {{footsteps}} did she stay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{patience}} with me," [...] I implored her. [...] "I... I am not myself to-day." [...] I sighed ponderously, and fell silent as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> ride away. Yet I hated them all; {{and most of}} all I hated the dainty, perfumed, golden-headed Cardinal-legate.|$|E
60|$|He went downstairs. A {{few minutes}} later they rode out from the straw-yard. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> past the line of hayricks, into the blacker shadows of the pines, then the tramp of hoofs began to fail in the darkness, and at last died away.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, our mysterious {{visitors}} are a welcome {{addition to our}} weakened crew. <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> at work. They are strong and willing. Mr. Pike says they are real sailormen, even if he doesn't understand their lingo. His theory {{is that they are}} from some small old-country or outlander ship, which, hove to on the opposite tack to the Elsinore, was run down and sunk.|$|R
60|$|A {{minute later}} {{they had left}} me, and <b>I</b> stood <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> until the two stars of light from their {{lanterns}} vanished into the blackness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{even though}} the mem-log--the white women of thy own blood--love thee? And remember, <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> driving in the evening; they are very fair.' ...|$|R
60|$|Presently, as <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them,</b> St. Auban spoke, and {{his voice}} {{was that of a}} man whose gums are toothless, or else whose nether lip is drawn in over his teeth whilst he speaks. Here again the dissimulation was as {{effective}} as it was simple.|$|E
60|$|Lady Angela smiled her farewells at me, and Ray nodded curtly. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> {{pass through}} the {{plantation}} and stroll across the Park. There was nothing very loverlike in their attitude. Ray seemed scarcely to be glancing towards his companion; Lady Angela had the air of one absorbed in thought. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> until they disappeared, and then I entered my own abode and sat down mechanically before the lunch which Grooton had prepared. I ate and drank as one in a dream. Only last night Ray had said nothing about coming to Braster. Yet, there he was, without luggage, with his arm and head bound up. Just like this I expected to see the man whom I had struck last night.|$|E
60|$|Once in my {{new place}} of concealment, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> as they {{approached}} the tree. There were about thirty men in the party and one woman--a girl whose hands seemed to be bound behind her and who was being pulled along by two of the men.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I,</b> <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> {{as we sat}} at our mid-day meal, grew {{sure that}} {{something}} out of the common had passed between them. Suzanne was very silent, {{and from time to time}} glanced at Ralph shyly, whereon, feeling her eyes, he would grow red as the sunset, and seeing his trouble, she would colour also, as though with the knowledge of some secret that made her both happy and ashamed.|$|R
5000|$|Director Michael Sporn {{has called}} Littlejohn [...] "an {{animation}} 'God'" [...] and cited {{his work as}} {{among the best in}} American animation. Of his work on the 1964 film [...] "Of Stars and Men," [...] Sporn said, [...] "Bill's work on Of Stars and Men has completely entered my vocabulary of great animation. The walk cycles for the many animals are just so majestic and regal that <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> over and over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, in {{the third}} court on the right after entering," [...] Chebron replied. [...] "They are {{repainting}} the figures on {{the upper part of}} the wall. <b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> at work yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Templars and the Hospitallers are crushed. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> in Jerusalem and the field, {{and love}} them not. Should they change their ways, or should I {{be needed to}} fight against the Infidel, I can join them by {{dispensation}} in days to come. But counsel me--what shall I do now?" ...|$|E
60|$|He signed her to precede him; {{and casting}} back {{a look that}} cut my heart, she obeyed. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them,</b> from the window, walk down the garden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley, whose trees {{concealed}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't live six weeks, some {{few months}} ago, in the Doctor's house for nothing; and I doubted that soon,' {{observed}} the client. [...] 'She would have doted on him, if her sister could have brought it about; but <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b> Marion avoided his name, avoided the subject: shrunk from the least allusion to it, with evident distress.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. It always blows tremulously, {{making the}} leaves of the trees shudder as if they were all aspens, but with a {{peculiar}} fitfulness which gives them--and <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> this moment as I write--an expression of anger as well as of fear and distress. You may see the kind of quivering, and hear the ominous whimpering, in the gusts that precede a great thunderstorm; but plague-wind is more panic-struck, and feverish; and its sound is a hiss instead of a wail.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very curious}} to walk about the streets, {{and see the}} boats on the canals, and what the people are {{carrying}} {{back and forth in}} <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> sometimes from the windows of the hotel, especially when it rains, and we cannot go out. They have every thing in these boats. They use some of them instead of houses; and the man who owns them lives in them with his wife and children, and sometimes with his ducks and chickens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Torfrida. [...] "I {{have read}} {{of such things}} in books of the ancients, and <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> making continually,--I little knew why, or that I should ever turn engineer." ...|$|R
