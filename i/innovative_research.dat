25|$|Slack (2003) compares {{three groups}} that {{conducted}} biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved {{important as a}} site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G.Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced <b>innovative</b> <b>research,</b> including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, {{over a long period}} of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Bahá'í faith {{imposes a}} system of {{in-house}} censorship on all Bahá'ís just as most Middle Eastern governments have practiced censorship since the rise of printing in the nineteenth century. Within the Bahá'í religion, any piece of writing by a Bahá'í author about the religion intended for publication is to be vetted by elected Bahá'í officials at the appropriate level (local, national, international). This requirement has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years. Critics charge that {{it has led to}} a paucity of intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of independent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers. The <b>innovative</b> <b>research</b> findings of the new generation of Bahá'í academics has in particular brought them into conflict with the conservatives in charge of the censorship apparatus. Although Bahá'í officials insist that the censorship requirement ("literature review") is [...] "temporary," [...] it has already lasted nearly a century, and the House of Justice {{has made it clear that}} it intends to keep it in effect for a very long time. And although it is sometimes alleged that [...] "review" [...] protects Bahá'í authors, in practice even work submitted for review, such as the Dialogue [...] "Modest Proposal," [...] can attract sanctions. Prepublication censorship has been among the primary techniques by which Bahá'í authors have been prevented from publishing on the controversies of contemporary Bahá'í history, and it is notable that the history of the community since about 1950 has not been written about in any detail. Contemporary history is off-limits as a subject because it would involve making value judgments on present office-holders. It is often alleged by Bahá'í conservatives that [...] "literature review" [...] does not actually impede the publication of research findings. But in 1988 the all-male House of Justice permanently suppressed an academic paper arguing that women could serve on the UHJ, insisting that only men could serve." ...|$|E
