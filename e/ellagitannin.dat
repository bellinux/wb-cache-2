25|$|Garden {{strawberries}} {{contain the}} dimeric <b>ellagitannin</b> agrimoniin {{which is an}} isomer of sanguiin H-6. Other polyphenols present include flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, such as hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. Strawberries contain fisetin and possess higher levels of this flavonoid than other fruits. Although achenes comprise only about 1% of total fresh weight of a strawberry, they contribute 11% of the fruit's total polyphenols, which, in achenes, include ellagic acid, ellagic acid glycosides, and ellagitannins.|$|E

50|$|The {{pomegranate}} <b>ellagitannins,</b> {{which include}} punicalagin isomers, are <b>ellagitannins</b> {{found in the}} fruit, rind (peel), bark or heartwood of pomegranates (Punica granatum).|$|R
40|$|<b>Ellagitannins</b> {{are a major}} {{class of}} {{phenolics}} {{largely responsible for the}} astringent and antioxidant properties of raspberries and blackberries. The Rubus <b>ellagitannins</b> constitute a complex mixture of monomeric and oligomeric tannins. Rubus oligomeric <b>ellagitannins</b> contain, beside the well-known ellagic acid and gallic acid moieties, the sanguisorboyl linking ester group. When exposed to acids or bases, ester bonds are hydrolyzed and the hexahydroxydiphenic acid spontaneously cyclizes into ellagic acid. This study describes a new, rapid procedure for the acid hydrolysis of Rubus <b>ellagitannins</b> in methanol, which results in maximal yield and enables the quantification of all the major reaction products. Additionally, the method provides the rationale for estimating the mean degree of polymerization of Rubus <b>ellagitannins.</b> JRC. I. 5 -Physical and chemical exposure...|$|R

[58] page 122, and also in Quercus species with gallotannins [60]. Walnut pellicle and seeds (Juglans regia L.) contains both <b>ellagitannins</b> and gallotannins [61, 62]. Although catechu (Acacia catechu Willd.) is known to contain {{a large amount of}} condensed tannins [58] page 14, Acacia species are also known to contain both hydrolysable and condensed tannins [60].|$|R

40|$|Improved {{method for}} the {{extraction}} and chromatographic analysis on a fused-core column of <b>ellagitannins</b> found in oak-aged wineDOI: 10. 1016 /j. foodchem. 2017. 01. 043 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SI Inclòs a la memòria: SIA new method {{for the analysis}} of <b>ellagitannins</b> observed in oak-aged wine is proposed, exhibiting interesting advantages with regard to previously reported analytical methods. The necessary extraction of <b>ellagitannins</b> from wine was simplified to a single step of solid phase extraction (SPE) using size exclusion chromatography with Sephadex LH- 20 without the need for any previous SPE of phenolic compounds using reversed-phase materials. The quantitative recovery of wine <b>ellagitannins</b> requires a combined elution with methanol and ethyl acetate, especially for increasing the recovery of the less polar acutissimins. The chromatographic method was performed using a fused-core C 18 column, thereby avoiding the coelution of main <b>ellagitannins,</b> such as vescalagin and roburin E. However, the very polar <b>ellagitannins,</b> namely, the roburins A, B and C, still partially coeluted, and their quantification was assisted by the MS detector. This methodology also enabled the analysis of free gallic and ellagic acids in the same chromatographic run...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} mechanical and enzymatic pretreatments on the extraction of anthocyanins and <b>ellagitannins</b> from blackberries. Continuous pressing yielded significantly higher turbidity values and content of anthocyanins and <b>ellagitannins</b> (P[*]< 0. 05) compared with discontinuous pressing. The use of enzymatic pretreatment also significantly increased the extraction of polyphenolic compounds (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), in particular that of total <b>ellagitannins,</b> on average from 437 to 982 [*]mg ellagic acid equivalents/ 100 [*]g (dry basis) when using discontinuous pressing. When microfiltration was used, the content of <b>ellagitannins</b> and anthocyanins {{was found to be}} similar in both feed and permeate when discontinuous press was used to extract the juice, but a significant decrease of 34 % (dry basis) was found in the concentration of <b>ellagitannins</b> when continuous pressing was used (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). These results should be useful for future efforts to increase the extraction of polyphenolic compounds from fruits and vegetables. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Plant tannins, {{including}} hydrolysable and condensed varieties, {{are well}} known antioxidants in medicinal plants, foods, and edible fruits. Their diverse biological properties and potential for disease prevention have been demonstrated by various in vitro and in vivo assays. A number of <b>ellagitannins,</b> {{the largest group of}} hydrolysable tannins, have been isolated from dicotyledoneous angiosperms and characterized. This diverse class of tannins is sub-grouped into simple <b>ellagitannins,</b> C-glycosidic <b>ellagitannins,</b> complex tannins (condensates of C-glycosidic tannins with flavan- 3 -ol), and oligomers up to pentamers. This review outlines and describes the chemotaxonomic significance of structural features in various types of <b>ellagitannins</b> found in plants belonging to the Myrtaceae, Onagraceae, and Melastomataceae families, which are all included in the order Myrtales.

40|$|Critical {{steps of}} a typical {{industrial}} line for processing a blackberry-based beverage in glass bottles have been studied, together {{with the effects of}} storage of final product at four different temperatures. For the steps, contents of total phenolics, anthocyanins, <b>ellagitannins,</b> andminor phenolic compounds were assessed byHPLC-DAD and antioxidant capacity by H-ORAC and DPPH. Thermal processes, especially blanching, drastically reduced anthocyanins,whereas hot-filling degraded <b>ellagitannins.</b> The final product showed reduced values for the anthocyanins cyanidin- 3 - glucoside (by 52 %) and cyanidin- 3 -malonyl glucoside (64 %), and <b>ellagitannins</b> lambertianin C (80 %), and sanguiin H- 6 (50 %). Antioxidant capacity (H-ORAC) dropped by almost 47 %. The anthocyanins and <b>ellagitannins</b> continued degrading during storage, especially if temperatures were high. Reduction kinetic parameters during storage were estimated for anthocyanins and, for the first time, for both lambertianin C and sanguiin H- 6. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Radioprotective {{activity}} of pure compounds {{isolated from the}} plant Phyllanthus amarus was studied using rat liver mitochondria and pBR 322 plasmid DNA as an in vitro model system. These compounds were <b>ellagitannins</b> namely amariin, 1 -galloyl- 2, 3 -dehydrohexahydroxydiphenyl (DHHDP) -glucose, repandusinic acid, geraniin, corilagin, phyllanthusiin D, and flavonoids namely rutin, and quercetin 3 -O-glucoside. The activity was then correlated with their hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activity. Both <b>ellagitannins</b> and flavonoids effectively prevented lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in mitochondria. The compounds also prevented radiation induced single strand breaks in pBR 322 plasmid DNA. The radioprotective {{activity of}} <b>ellagitannins</b> and flavonoids {{could be due to}} their ability to scavenge different radicals more or less efficiently, relieving the oxidative stress. Protection conferred by flavonoids, rutin and quercetin 3 -O-glucoside to rat liver mitochondria and plasmid pBR 322 DNA from radiation induced damage was due to their strong hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The inhibitory effect of <b>ellagitannins</b> on lipid peroxidation in liver mitochondria was due to their efficient superoxide radical scavenging ability.
