5|$|Adams <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{headwaters}} for {{two major}} rivers, the Lewis River and White Salmon River. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs {{at its base}} flow into two more major river systems, the Cispus River and the Klickitat River. The streams on {{the north and west}} portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; {{it can be}} made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orionid shower in October.|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{souls of the}} Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has {{a close relationship with}} God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E

5|$|Sophie, a young milliner, {{encounters}} a wizard named Howl {{on her way}} to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the country. She meets a scarecrow, whom she decides to call 'Turnip Head'. He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle's energy and magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that Calcifer let her in, and she has hired herself as a cleaning lady for the house.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's cult re-emerged in the 10th {{century and}} the site of his burial grew wealthy {{as a result of}} {{receiving}} grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint's life and early cult. In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury 960-988. Dunstan himself <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story of the martyrdom, which he had heard told long before, in the presence of King Æthelstan, by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund's own sword-bearer (armiger) on the fatal day. Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan, then still living and the recipient of his work, the authority for what he has to say.|$|E
5|$|Jack survives {{and finds}} himself on Devil's Reef, where he discovers old {{smuggling}} tunnels beneath the seabed, leading {{him to the}} underwater city of Y'ha-nthlei. The city {{is found to be}} located below Devil's Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order. U.S. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y'ha-nthlei, but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city. The Temple of Dagon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier, but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference. Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones {{at the bottom of the}} city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra - whose song is generating the barrier - by deafening himself to her song, allowing him to take control of Deep Ones. With the barrier down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey.|$|E

5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} of Hale and Hale Barns {{are closely}} linked; what {{would later become}} Hale Barns {{spent most of the}} medieval period {{as an extension of the}} more dominant Hale. During this era the land around Hale and Hale Barns was used agriculturally because although the soil is poor draining, it is fertile. By the middle of the 15th century Hale Barns had established an identity completely separate from neighbouring Hale as demonstrated by the tithe barn which was established around this time. The tithe barn was for storing the tithes – a tenth of the farm's produce which was to be given to the church. Such an establishment can be seen as a sign of the area's prosperity. The original barn no longer survives but there is a drawing of it (from 1844). It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village's name. The first explicit reference to the village of Hale Barns– rather than Hale– is in a document from 1616.|$|E

Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance. As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he is the source of radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with MN28 {{on the eastern}} edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly along the shore of Big Stone Lake. The lake <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota River and forms the Minnesota–South Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community of Foster before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN7 curves to the south along the shore and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South {{of the end of the}} lake, MN7 merges with US12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN7 merges onto US75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF Railway used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN7 which continues along the northern banks of the river.|$|E
