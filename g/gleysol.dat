The size of Haplic Luvisol and Mollic <b>Gleysol</b> aggregates had an impact on significant differentiation of the water bounded with the potential less than 10 kJ m- 3 (pF 2). The saturated water conductivity increases significantly with the increase of aggregate size. The diffusivity coefficients of all the investigated aggregate fractions increased with the increase of moisture and they were higher for Mollic <b>Gleysol</b> aggregates than for Haplic Luvisol ones. The increase of evaporation under steady-state conditions was determined by the soil aggregation, i. e., the evaporation was always higher for fine- and medium-aggregated soil samples than for coarse-aggregated ones.

40|$|The studied area {{is placed}} in North-East Jebel locality. Based on the {{physical}} and chemical characteristics and soil morphology profile, the following types of soil were identified: typical preluvosol, typical and gleyic eutricambosols, luvic solonet, <b>gleysol,</b> gleyic vertisol and gleyic-stagnic vertisol. The assessment of land quality (fertility) was determined by bonitation. For the notes of bonitation calculation, the following ecopedological indicatories have been used: annual medium temperature, annual medium precipitations, depth of the underground water, texture in Ap horizon, gleization, pseudogleization, salinization, edafic volume, porosity, soil reaction (pH), humus reserve and content of CaCO 3. The way that these indicators influence the notes of bonitation is different from a type of soil to another {{and the use of}} land. Thus, for grassland, typical preluvosol, the note of bonitate is 81 and it’s included in class II of quality (favorability), luvic solonet with 63 points in class IV of quality, typical eutricambosols with 58 points and vertisol with 57 points, in class V of quality, <b>gleysol</b> with 32 points and gleyic eutricambosol with 36 points, in class VII of quality. In case of using the land for growing maize, we have the following: typical preluvosol with 90 points which is in class II of quality, typical eutricambosol with 54 points and gleyic vertisol with 60 points, in class V of quality, luvic solonet with 49 points in class VI of quality, gleyic-stagnic vertisol with 35 points, in class VII of quality, <b>gleysol</b> with 24 points and gleyic eutricambosol with 29 points, in class VIII of quality.

40|$|Drained organic {{soils are}} {{anthropogenic}} emission hotspots {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs). Most {{studies have focused on}} deep peat soils and on peats with high organic carbon content. In contrast, histic <b>Gleysols</b> are characterized by shallow peat layers, which are left over from peat cutting activities or by peat mixed with mineral soil. It is unknown whether they emit less GHGs than deep Histosols when drained. We present the annual carbon and GHG balance of grasslands for six sites on nutrient-poor histic <b>Gleysols</b> with a shallow (30 cm) histic horizon or mixed with mineral soil in Northern Germany (soil organic carbon concentration (C org) from 9 to 52 %). The net GHG balance, corrected for carbon export by harvest, was around 4 t CO 2 –C–eq ha − 1 yr − 1 on soils with peat layer and little drainage (mean annual water table < 20 cm below surface). The net GHG balance reached 7 – 9 t CO 2 –C–eq ha − 1 yr − 1 on soils with sand mixed into the peat layer and water tables between 14 cm and 39 cm below surface. GHG emissions from drained histic <b>Gleysols</b> (i) were as high as those from deep Histosols, (ii) increase linearly from shallow to deeper drainage, (iii) but are not affected by C org content of the histic horizon. Ecosystem respiration (R eco) was linearly correlated with water table level even if it was below the histic horizon. The R eco /GPP ratio was 1. 5 at all sites, so that we ruled out a major influence of the inter-site variability in vegetation composition on annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The IPCC definition of organic soils includes shallow histic topsoil, unlike most national and international definitions of Histosols. Our study confirms that this broader definition is appropriate considering anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils. Countries currently apply soil maps in national GHG inventories which are likely not to include histic <b>Gleysols.</b> The land area with GHG emission hotspots due to drainage is likely to be much higher than anticipated. Deeply drained histic <b>Gleysols</b> are GHG hotspots that have so far been neglected or underestimated. Peat mixing with sand does not mitigate GHG emissions. Our study implies that rewetting organic soils, including histic <b>Gleysols,</b> has a much higher relevance for GHG mitigation strategies than currently recognized...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} soil organic matter in the Nature Reserve Žitavský wetland. The area is located on a fluvial plain of Žitava River. Soil pits were trenched on Mollic Fluvisol, Eutric Fluvisol and Histi-Umbric <b>Gleysol.</b> Since the average CT pool in topsoil of Histi-Umbric Gleysols in Slovakia is around 15. 8 g. kg- 1, we assume, that high content of organic carbon in A horizon (72. 54 g. kg- 1) occur due to sedimentation of organic particles from water. Based on results of organic carbon content and its stability, but mainly on sharp increase of humus quality (HA : FA increased from 0. 82 to 1. 72) we concluded, that in depth of 0. 6 m started A horizon of buried Mollic Fluvisol.

Soil samples were incubated for 60 days, with and without organic residue incorporation. After this period, we applied the corrective and incubated the soil for 30 days, then P and basic fertilization (macro and micronutrients) were applied and the soil was incubated for additional 60 days. Equilibrium phosphorus, maximum phosphate adsorption capacity, pH, exchangeable Al and phosphorus-buffering index were measured.

40|$|The {{influence}} of soil type, slope and drainage on tree growth patterns (density, tree size, crown canopy cover and cork yield) was assessed in a cork oak montado, located in Central-western Portugal, {{based on a}} GIS approach followed by field survey. Five soil groups, that is, Arenosols, Regosols, Podzols, Luvisols and <b>Gleysols,</b> combined in three slope classes (flat, undulating and steep) under two different hydromorphic conditions (normal or deficient) were compared based on five cork oak stand parameters using ANOVA and PCA tests. The results showed a clear {{influence of}} soil type on cork oak growth patterns (cork yield, basal area, number of trees per hectare, crown canopy cover and circumference at breast height). In Arenosols all parameters showed maximum values and, in contrast, in <b>Gleysols</b> were found the minimum values. For instance, {{the average of the}} annual cork production for <b>Gleysols</b> (153 kg ha 1 year 1) was only 70 % of the expected annual cork production of Arenosols (219 kg ha 1 year 1) and the average exploited tree density decreased from 56 trees ha 1 in Arenosols to 44 trees ha 1 in <b>Gleysols,</b> for an average exploited tree density of 53 trees ha 1 for the study area. Slope also seems to influence the cork oak growth patterns, as significant statistical differences were found for cork oak growth parameters between slope classes: steep slopes decreased the cork production, the tree size (circumference at breast height) and the tree density. An overall PCA test showed that three main soil groups could be identified: (i) Arenosols and Podzols; (ii) Regosols and (iii) Luvisols and <b>Gleysols,</b> showing that the former, which could allow the tree root development, have a positive influence on the cork oak growth. A two-way analysis of variance, for soil type and slope, showed that the cork yield and the exploited tree density are clearly affected by these two factors interaction...|$|R

Drainage of biogenic accumulation area leads to a series of transformations in accumulated formations, including the process of decession. The studies conducted in the years 2009 – 2012 were focused on post-bog soils near lakes: Strzeszowskie, Sitno and Drawskie in Western Pomerania. The examined soils belong to murshic soils and <b>gleysols</b> (The classification of Polish soils). Mursh horizons contained from 0. 2 to 43. 3 % of carbonate and from 27. 2 to 77. 6 % of non-carbonates fractions (Ncf), and varying amount of organic matter depending on the degree of mineralisation. Specific density of surface horizons was in the range from 1. 76 to 2. 33 Mg·m− 3, and bulk density from 0. 28 to 0. 68 Mg·m− 3. Higher porosity was found in mursh organic soils in comparison to <b>gleysols.</b> The studies showed that the content of carbonate fraction was related with specific density, bulk density, porosity and water capacity.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} to obtain satisfactory soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield in acid soils {{in many developing countries}} is the purchasability of liming materials. For many low income farmers, liming to the 'ideal' soil pH of 6. 5 using conventional methods is usually too expensive. Pot and field studies were conducted to determine whether satisfactory soybean growth could be obtained by reducing the amount of lime applied and the volume of soil limed. The Quebec soils used in these studies were a Gray-brown Luvisol (pH 5. 1) and a Humic <b>Gleysol</b> (pH 5. 3) in the pot study and a Gray-brown Luvisol (pH 5. 1) and a Dark-gray <b>Gleysol</b> (pH 6. 1) in the field study.

The experiments were performed with the use of undisturbed soil samples preincubated on the water tension plates at 0, 63, 159 and 500 hPa at room temperature. All the investigated parameters varied widely in the tested soils. Dehydrogenase activity and reduced iron content decreased but ODR and Eh values increased with increasing soil water tension. A close relationship between oxygenation indicators (ODR, Eh and Fe+ 2) and dehydrogenase activity was found.

Nitrogen rates of 0, 90, and 180 kg N ha- 1 for corn and 0, 20, and 40 kg N ha- 1 for monocropped soybean were used, and soybean/alfalfa with no fertilizer N following corn. Rates of N 2 O emissions were significantly affected by N fertilization, tillage and soil moisture content. Generally, N 2 O emissions {{were higher in the}} NT systems, with corn, and increased with increasing N rates. Increased nitrogen applications led to linear increases in N 2 O emission over the three years for both Ste. Rosalie (2) and Ormstown soils at a rate of 1. 0 to 1. 6 percent of added N. The N 2 O emission rates were significantly related to soil denitrification rates, water filled pore space, and soil NH 4 + and NO 3 [...] concentrations in all three years.
