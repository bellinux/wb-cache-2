Moreover, fund flows respond positively to lagged strategy returns but not to lagged returns of dependent firms, suggesting that the supply of capital is not driven by changes in firm investment opportunities. We also examine an <b>isolated</b> <b>market</b> dislocation that occurred in 2005 when funds suffered large withdrawals.

Such actors are expected to engage in continuing dialogue and resource-sharing in order to develop mutually beneficial joint projects and to manage the inevitable contradictions and dilemmas associated therewith.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the reasons for}} high grocery prices in a small <b>isolated</b> <b>market.</b> The starting point of our study is {{the knowledge that the}} price of food in the Åland Islands-a small archipelago between Finland and Sweden-is significantly higher than in continental Finland. We also know that store-level economies of scale in grocery retailing mean that the structure of a small market is, even in the best case, either inefficient or uncompetitive. The article compares the price level of stores in Åland and Finland. Our aim is to decompose the price differences and allocate them between their various causes. The empirical results of the study are in accordance with the theory: high prices in Åland arise from a small average store size, high concentration in both the retailing and the food processing sector, border taxes, and transportation costs. An additional source of high prices is the strong regional spirit of the Ålanders: they are prepared to pay higher prices for products that are made in Åland.

Linear operators representing basic financial transactions such as cash transfer and the buying or selling of securities are constructed and simple model Hamiltonians that generate the temporal evolution due to cash flows and the trading of securities are proposed. The Hamiltonian describing financial transactions becomes local when the profit/loss from trading is small compared to the turnover. This approximation may describe a highly liquid and efficient stock market.

40|$|We formalize the {{phenomenon}} of disruptive technologies (Christensen, 1997) that initially serve <b>isolated</b> <b>market</b> niches and, as they mature, expand to displace established technologies from mainstream segments. Using a model of horizontal and vertical differentiation with discrete customer segmentation, we show how the threat of disruption varies with the rate of technological advance, the number of firms using each technology, segments sizes, marginal costs, {{and the ability of}} firms to price discriminate. We characterize the effect of disruption on prices, market shares, social welfare and innovation incentives. We show that a shift from isolation to disruption lowers prices and increases social welfare, but may either increase or decrease the profits of firms using the new technology. By identifying the drivers and implications of technology competition, we contribute to debates about market definition that are often central in anti-trust deliberations. Moreover, we call into question standard results on the effects of mergers in Cournot models. Prior work finds that, absent efficiency gains, mergers among Cournot competitors lower welfare and are only profitable for the merging firms at high levels of concentration. We show that neither of these results need hold when mergers can alter the boundaries of technology competition. market definition; mergers; threat of substitutes...|$|E

Controlling Market Power and Price Spikes in Electricity Networks: Demand-Side Bidding In this paper we report experiments that examine how two structural features of electricity networks contribute to the exercise of market power in deregulated markets. The first feature is the distribution of ownership of a given set of generating assets. In the market power treatment, two large firms are allocated baseload and intermediate cost generators such that either firm might unilaterally withhold the capacity of its intermediate cost generators from the market {{to benefit from the}} supracompetitive prices that would result from only selling its baseload units. In the converse treatment, ownership of some of the intermediate cost generators is transferred from each of these firms to two other firms, so that no one firm could unilaterally restrict output to spawn supra-competitive prices. The second feature explores how the presence of line constraints in a radial network may segment the market and promote supra-competitive pricing in the <b>isolated</b> <b>market</b> segments. We also consider the interaction effect when both of these structural features are present. Having established a wellcontrolled data set with price spikes paralleling those observed in the naturally occurring economy, we also extend the design to include demand-side bidding. We find that demand-side bidding completely neutralizes the exercise of market power and eliminates price spikes...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Thesis is to {{evaluate}} the underlying access regulation pertaining to LNG terminals resulting in the coexistence of unregulated and regulated LNG terminals. Correspondingly comparing the situation on liberalised markets with the proposed regulation in Finland. There are two ground presumptions that lays down the frame for the Thesis. The first presumption believes that a liberalised market model is better for Finland compared to the current <b>isolated</b> <b>market</b> status. The rationale {{is based on the}} common targets set by the EU supporting the full implementation of the Third Gas Directive and opening the market for competition. Although the argumentation of the Thesis support a liberalised market, there are certain concerns lingering in the legislative air pertaining to the LNG terminal access regime. In light of these the Thesis’s discussion is built around these possible shortcomings. As the thesis concludes that a well-formulated, thoughtful and comprehensive liberalisation will bring about more advantages than disadvantages, a thoroughly discussion on the market triggers will be given. The second presumption is that regulated and unregulated regimes are not good or bad per se, the decision to choose between them by regulators should take into account the characteristics of the market. As will be later demonstrated, many regulatory schemes are hybrid, showing features of both access regimes. These two presumptions embodies the supporting pillars of this Thesis, the theme of which is the relationship between and the evaluation of unregulated and regulated access to LNG terminals. The object is to discuss and evaluate the legal framework around access regimes pertaining to LNG terminals and consequently add content to the presumptions. The complexity of the questions is demonstrated by the opinions given by market participants during the comment round of the proposal. There is a visible opposition to apply the reformed NGMA to off-grid terminals. These opinions, the opposition and the arguments surrounding the proposed legislation, gives this Thesis its core. However, this is not only a national resistance but a commonly discussed question: whether the access regime, where a coexistence of both unregulated and regulated access regimes is applicable, fully serve the intention of a liberalised LNG market...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five self-contained papers, {{which are all}} related to the financial markets in the three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Paper [I] studies the impact of news from the Moscow and New York stock exchanges on the returns and volatilities of the Baltic States' stock market indices using a time series model that accounts for asymmetries in the conditional mean and variance functions. We find that news from New York has stronger e¤ects on returns in Tallinn. High-risk shocks in New York have a stronger impact on volatility in Tallinn, whereas volatility in Vilnius is more in. uenced by high-risk shocks from Moscow. Riga {{does not seem to}} be affected by news arriving from abroad. Paper [II] suggests a nonlinear and multivariate time series model framework that enables the study of simultaneity in returns and in volatilities, as well as asymmetric effects arising from shocks and exogenous variables. The model is employed to study the three Baltic States' stock exchanges. Using daily data, we find recursive structures, with returns in Riga, directly depending on returns in Tallinn and Vilnius, and Tallinn on Vilnius. For volatilities, both Riga and Vilnius depend on Tallinn. Paper [III] studies the link between political news, and the returns and volatilities in the Baltic States' stock markets. We find that domestic and foreign non-Russian political news led, on average, to lower uncertainty in the stock markets of Riga and Tallinn in 2001 - 2003. At the same time, political risk from Russia increased the volatility of the stock market in Tallinn. There is a weak relationship between political risk and the stock market volatility in the Baltic countries in 2004 - 2007. Paper [IV] studies the impact of market jumps on the time varying return correlations between stock market indices in the Baltic countries. An EARJI-EGARCH model facilitating direct modeling of the time varying return correlations is introduced. The empirical results indicate that there are quite a large number of identified jumps in the emerging Baltic States' stock markets. <b>Isolated</b> <b>market</b> jumps in one of the markets generally have no or small e¤ects on the time-varying correlations. In contrast, simultaneous jumps of equal sign increase the average correlation, in some cases by as much as 100 percent. In Paper [V] the hypothesis that financial development promotes economic growth is tested for the three Baltic countries using a time series approach that allows for interactions between the countries. We find that economic growth is a positive function of financial development, proxied by the amount of bank credit to the private sector, in the long run. The results also show that there is long run interaction between the three Baltic countries...|$|E

40|$|Strategic {{interaction}} between gas and electricity sectors {{is a major}} issue in the implementation of competitive energy markets. One relevant aspect of the problem is the potential for input foreclosure between gas and power industries. In this paper, we are concerned with situations where input foreclosure opportunities are associated with the choice of market design. In particular, we study input foreclosure in the case that the short-term capacity allocation mechanism of gas networks raises barriers to cross-border trade. In that situation, one may find gas <b>markets</b> that are <b>isolated</b> only in the short term. We explain players' ability to influence the electricity price using their gas decisions in those <b>isolated</b> <b>markets.</b> We also show that this should be a concern of EU capacity allocation mechanisms, which provide spatial flexibility in the short term to promote liquidity, at the cost of creating barriers to cross-border trade.
