Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. <b>Effluent</b> <b>limits</b> for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E
25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand.

Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric <b>effluent</b> <b>limits</b> and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years.

40|$|An {{optimal control}} of {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTP) has to account {{for changes in the}} bio-chemical state of the bioreactors. As many process variables of a WWTP are not measurable online, the development of an efficient control strategy {{is one of the greatest}} challenges in the optimization of WWTP operation. This paper presents an approach, which combines the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and a clustering algorithm to identify operational patterns in WWTP process data. These patterns provide a basis for the optimization of controller set points that are well suited for the previously identified operation regimes of the plant. The optimization is performed using Genetic Algorithms. This approach was developed, tested and validated on a simulation model based on the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM 1). The results of this state-based control indicate that the presented methodology is a promising and useful control strategy that is definitely able to address the distinctive energy and <b>effluent</b> <b>limit</b> challenges faced by WWTP operators...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study focused on the occurrence and removal of dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) and poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in both conventional and membrane wastewater treatment processes.

On the other hand, the membrane bioreactor was capable of perfectly removing PCDDs/Fs and PCBs giving an effluent characterised by concentrations under the limit of detection for most of the tested compounds. This efficiency was the result of both the solids removal from the effluent (permeate) and the application of prolonged solid retention times which enabled the bioconversion of those compounds as demonstrated by the mass balances. A mathematical model was developed to predict the final fate of a given molecule according to the operational conditions applied in the wastewater treatment process. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Clean Water Act {{regulations}} specify technology-based <b>effluent</b> <b>limits</b> {{for classes}} and categories of industries, and describes {{the circumstances in}} which states may require <b>effluent</b> <b>limits</b> or monitoring requirements more stringent than technology-based standards. The Clean Water Act relies on a permit system, known as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to regulate water discharges. Facilities may be assigned a specific mercury discharge limit, or may only be required to monitor their discharge for mercury. Facilities report actual discharge levels in Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), which {{serve as the basis for}} determining compliance.. Pretreatment standards regulate industries that discharge into a publicly owned treatment plant (POTW) instead of discharging directly into a receiving water body. Regulations list industrial categories subject to national categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing facilities that discharge into treatment plants. POTWs with approved pretreatment programs may set permit limits and conduct inspections of industrial users. Facilities that do not have specific pretreatment standards for mercury (or other hazardous substances), are supposed to notify the POTW of any hazardous waste discharge that exceeds 100 kg per month. Wastestreams from certain manufacturing processes that may involve mercury, such as fluorescent lamps and switchgear, are excluded from categorical pretreatment standards because they are considered dilute.|$|E

5000|$|Wastewater {{is treated}} at the Siloam Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant (SSWWTP). Since {{effluent}} is discharged into {{a tributary of}} the Illinois, the plant's effluent is required to meet the treatment standards of both Arkansas and Oklahoma. The phosphorus load of the Illinois has been subject of controversy in the area, even reaching the United States Supreme Court in 1992. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified the Illinois as Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, listing it as an [...] "impaired and threatened water" [...] due to the high phosphorus loads. As a result of the applicable strict phosphorus effluent regulations, SSWWTP upgraded its system in 2011. The upgrades also increased capacity 25% to 5.5 million gallons per day (MGD) (14,474 liters per hour). Although presently a traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant capable of meeting the interim phosphorus limit, pilot tests have proven a chemical nutrient removal (CNR) and membrane biological reactor combination to be effective well below the possible future permit limit. However, due to the high cost, these phases have been delayed. Currently, a 3-year study is being conducted to determine the background phosphorus level in the Illinois. The future <b>effluent</b> <b>limits</b> will likely be written following the conclusion of the study. An EPA Total maximum daily load (TMDL) study in the watershed is also ongoing.|$|E

40|$|Background: Fluoride {{exists in}} various forms in nature and water resources., The rising level of {{fluoride}} in water resources due to discharge of industrial effluents can cause toxicity in aquatic organisms. To prevent toxicity, {{it is necessary to}} determine maximum fluoride toxicity as well as <b>effluent</b> discharge <b>limits.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the maximum fluoride toxicity and the factors affecting fluoride toxicity to provide a model in order to determine the <b>effluent</b> discharge <b>limits.</b> Methods: Daphnia magna bioassay in the absence of confounding factors was used to determine the maximum level of fluoride toxicity. Then, bioassay was repeated in the presence of the confounding factors (hardness, temperature and exposure time) to determine their effects. Results: In the absence of intervening factors, fluoride LC 50 levels determined after 24, 48 and 72 hours exposure were 4. 9, 46. 5 and 38. 7 mg/l, respectively [...] Also, the influence of confounding factors on LC 50 values was reported significant by Minitab software. Conclusion: Increasing the water hardness reduced fluoride toxicity, and increasing the water temperature and exposure time increased fluoride toxicity in aquatic environments. Therefore, while determining the wastewater discharge limit in terms of fluoride concentration, it is essential to take the effect of confounding factors on fluoride toxicity into account in order to prevent toxicity in the open water resources...|$|R

40|$|Rivers {{can provide}} {{valuable}} supply {{of drinking water}} for humans, irrigation water to farmlands, water for hydropower and home for many aquatic ecosystems. However, due to population increase and its adverse effects on the rivers, inappropriate farming activities in the river catchments, and other similar adverse activities, the water quality in rivers has generally declined. Therefore, appropriate river water quality management strategies aimed at controlling and improving water quality should be seriously considered.

40|$|Trametes villosa laccase {{was used}} for direct azo dye {{degradation}} for which the reaction products were analyzed {{over long periods of}} time. Laccases have been extensively studied for the degradation of azo dyes [1 - 3]. These enzymes are multicopper phenol oxidases that decolorize azo dyes through a highly non-specific free radical mechanism forming phenolic type compounds, thereby avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic amines [4, 5]. In the literature, there are a large number of papers reporting on decolorization of azo dyes however the fate of the products of azo dye laccase reactions is ignored [6 - 8]. Therefore, the purpose of this work is the study of the azo dye degradation products in the presence of laccase. Direct azo dye laccase degradation and amino-phenols polymerization was performed for several days. The formed soluble products were studied by LC-MS while the polymerized insoluble products were studied by 13 C -NMR. LC-MS analysis shows the formation of phenolic compounds in the dye oxidation process as well as a large amount of polymerized products that retain the azo group integrity. The amino-phenols reactions were also investigated by 13 C-NMR and LC-MS analysis and the real polymerization character of laccase enzymes was shown.

The global sensitivity analyses were performed to understand and characterize tritium {{behaviors in the}} coupled HTGR/MTG system. This Monte Carlo based random sampling method was used to evaluate maximum 17, 408 numbers of samples with different input values. According to the analyses, the average tritium concentration in the product gasoline is about 3. 05 × 10 - 3 Bq/cm 3, and 62 % cases are within the tritium <b>effluent</b> <b>limit</b> (= 3. 7 x 10 - 3 Bq/cm 3 [STP]).

These four parameters contribute about 95 % of the total output uncertainties. This study strongly recommends focusing our future research on these four parameters to improve modeling accuracy and to mitigate tritium permeation into the gasol ine product.
