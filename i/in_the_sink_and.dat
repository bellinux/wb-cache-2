The dripping faucet plays more melodies with a pile of dishes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> then becomes magnified in Donald's delirious mind, first appearing as giant, booming drops of water falling from a great height into a much deeper sink. The drops turn into falling bombs with an even deeper louder sound, shaking Donald violently as he rolls up inside his mattress to try to escape the sound. His whole house then begins shaking off its foundations with each drop. Soon the whole earth is affected and shakes with each drop as the incessant drops are increasingly magnified in Donald's sleep-deprived mind.|$|E

Jillian leaves the hospital on her own but Spencer follows her because of his connection with the twins inside her. At home, Jillian barricades the door and goes into the room where she dreamed her sister was killed. She sees her body on the floor, but then it is gone, presumably a vision. When Spencer breaks {{his way into the}} apartment, she has flooded the kitchen floor with water, with a radio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> an extension cord plugged into the wall. She holds the ends of the cords in each hand and tells Spencer to stay away from her. She notices bloody nail marks on Spencer's hand and she knows that her sister really is dead, as she dreamed. She tells Spencer she doesn't know who he is, that he killed her sister and her husband. He tells her he did, and that he lived inside of her now. Water begins pouring down from the ceiling, as Jillian turned on all of the water in the bathroom upstairs. Spencer is engulfed in the water, Jillian lifts her feet off the wet floor, connects the cords and electrocutes the alien. The alien leaves Spencer's body and transmits into Jillian.|$|E

50|$|At breakfast, Claire, the narrator, {{is shocked}} to learn her husband Stuart and his three buddies found {{the body of a}} girl washed up on the rivershore upon {{arriving}} in the afternoon for their yearly camping trip, as reported by the morning newspaper. Instead of reporting the body to the police right away, the four enjoy their vacation fishing, eating, and drinking whisky as they sit by the fire. As the quartet packs up the next morning, Stuart uses a payphone to call the body into the police. Claire feels distanced from her husband and cannot stop wondering about the dead girl, whom she feels connected to. She believes Stuart and his friends could have killed her perhaps. Claire wonders why they didn't go fishing locally, why didn't they report the body quickly. Later, after the body is identified and Stuart is at work, Claire reads the funeral plans in the newspaper and decides to attend. On her way to the funeral, a man in a pickup truck pulls her over and asks to talk to her, wants to make sure she's safe. Claustrophobic and frightened, Claire clicks her car locks shut and says she's fine. After the funeral Claire overhears a woman saying they caught the killer, but Claire is not so certain they have the right man. The story ends with Stuart making a sexual advance on Claire in the kitchen. As he reaches for her breasts, she hears water running <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> is reminded of the girl floating in the river. The manuscript version of the same title appears in Beginners (2009).|$|E
40|$|International audienceGeophysical {{data and}} {{sampling}} of the Golo Basin (East Corsica margin) provide the opportunity to study mass balance in a single drainage system over the last 130 kyr, by comparing deposited sediments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> the maximum eroded volume in the source using total denudation proxies. Evaluation of the solid sediments deposited offshore and careful integration of uncertainties from the age model and physical properties allow us to constrain three periods of sedimentation during the last climatic cycle. The peak of sedimentation initiated during Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 3 (ca. 45 ka) and lasted until late in MIS 2 (ca. 18 ka). This correlates with Mediterranean Sea palaeoclimatic records and the glaciation in high altitude Corsica. The yield of solid sediment into the Golo Basin drops in the observed present day Mediterranean basins (gauging stations), whereas the palaeo-denudation estimate derived from the sediments over the last glacial period is one to ten times higher than that predicted using cosmogenic or thermochronometer estimates of exhumation. The catchment-wide denudation rate calculated from deposited solid sediment ranges from 47 to 219 mm kyr− 1, which {{is higher than the}} estimate from palaeosurface ablation in the proximal part of the source (9 - 140 mm kyr− 1) and lower than the distal, narrow, incised channel of the Golo River (160 - 475 mm kyr− 1). This mismatch raises questions about the investigation of denudation at millennial-time scale (kyr) and at higher integrating times (Myr) as a reliable tool for determining the effect of climate change on mountain building and on sedimentary basin models...|$|E

One of the main research challenges regarding wireless sensor networks is user deployment, namely in terms of configuration and management. On non-commercial solutions the user typically must be aware of the underlying technology to obtain sensing services. Internet connectivity is also desirable, so future deployments must take into consideration this feature, enabling realistic ubiquitous computing. This paper presents a user-centric solution for IPv 6 -enabled wireless sensor networks, using the Contiki operating system and Crossbow TelosB motes, featuring a Plug-and-Play like experience. One of the motes provides sink node capability to the network, through USB connection with a personal computer, which sends and receives data, presenting it to the user. A dedicated serial protocol for USB communication with the sink was developed and extensively debugged, featuring sink querying and network configuration. The current testbed uses User Datagram Protocol over IPv 6, with 6 LoWPAN, and IEEE 802. 15. 4 wireless communication between the sensor network motes and the sink device. A Plug-and-Play like operation is achieved through zero-user configuration, since the user only needs to plug <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> give power to the remote motes...|$|E
