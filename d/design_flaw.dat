5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> comparable to CryptoDefense; it {{used the same}} keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed. By late-November 2014, {{it was estimated that}} over 9,000 users had been infected by TorrentLocker in Australia alone, trailing only Turkey with 11,700 infections.|$|E
5|$|Because of a <b>design</b> <b>flaw,</b> {{ships of}} this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} activities in re-engineering pro-cess is detecting <b>design</b> <b>flaws.</b> Such <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> prevent an efficient maintenance, and further development of a sys-tem. This research proposes a novel metric-based heuristic framework to detect and locate object-oriented <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> from the source code. It is accomplished by evaluating de-sign quality of an object-oriented system through quantify-ing deviations from good design heuristics and principles. While <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> can occur at any level, the proposed ap-proach assesses the design quality of internal and external structure of a system at the class level {{which is the most}} fundamental level of a system. In a nutshell, <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> are detected and located systematically in two phases using a generic OO design knowledge-base. In the first phase, hotspots are detected by primitive classifiers via measuring metrics indicating a design feature (e. g. complexity). In the second phase, individual <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> will be detected by composite classifiers using a proper set of metrics. We have chosen JBoss Application Server as the case study, due to its pure OO large size structure, and its success as an open source J 2 EE platform among developers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A browser is {{considered}} to be a functional window to the Internet. It is interface software that serves as a communication medium between the users and the Internet. Sophisticated attack patterns and <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> in browsers pose serious threats to user security, privacy, and integrity. Recent advancements have shown that browser User Interface (UI) <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> catalyze the vulnerability exploitation. This paper sheds light on the <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> in Graphical User Interface (GUI) components of browsers that are exploited by the attackers to trick users to perform rogue operations. In most of the cases, the user is unaware of the attack that results in stealth operations. Thus, user ignorance plays a critical role in successful exploitation of the <b>design</b> <b>flaws...</b>|$|R

5|$|Rome's Ciampino airport, {{the site}} of the first Comet hull loss, was the origin of more {{disastrous}} Comet flights just over a year later. On 10 January 1954, 20minutes after taking off from Ciampino, the first production Comet, G-ALYP, broke up in mid-air while operating BOAC Flight 781 and crashed into the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Elba with the loss of all 35 on board. With no witnesses to the disaster and only partial radio transmissions as incomplete evidence, no obvious reason for the crash could be deduced. Engineers at de Havilland immediately recommended 60 modifications aimed at any possible <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> while the Abell Committee met to determine potential causes of the crash. BOAC also voluntarily grounded its Comet fleet pending investigation into the causes of the accident.|$|E
5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a <b>design</b> <b>flaw,</b> and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLockerâ€”using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying <b>design</b> <b>flaw,</b> wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E
5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of Â£887; the second cost Â£1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a <b>design</b> <b>flaw</b> that caused poor sightlines {{for the majority of the}} crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for Â£8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for Â£1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for Â£2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious <b>design</b> <b>flaw,</b> with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Small {{dairy farms}} in hot climates are encountering several {{problems}} caused by <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> of the implemented housing designs. Consequently, heat stress increase and milk yield dramatically decreases, which leads to economic deficiency of the farm. One key issue is to develop simple means to rectify the <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> with minimum costs. In order to develop feasible means, <b>design</b> <b>flaws</b> were detected in 14 small dairy farms in Egypt to exemplify the <b>flaws</b> of housing <b>designs</b> in arid and semi-arid zones. A package of interconnected solutions is suggested to rectify the <b>design</b> <b>flaws.</b> Subsequently, the maximum temperature, dry-bulb temperature, black-globe temperature, dew point, relative humidity, shaded area, and air velocity were measured inside the rectified vs. non-rectified cowsheds and compared after conducting the statistical analysis. On the other hand, the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and Black Globe Humidity Index (BGHI) were calculated {{to find out the}} level of heat stress affecting the dairy cows. Furthermore, the milk yield, respiration rate, skin temperature, feed intake were recorded and compared. Moreover, the costs of the developed means were calculated and a feasibility study was carried out. The results showed that the developed means ar...|$|R
