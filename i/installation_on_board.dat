Although electrical propulsion had already been used in Finnish icebreakers for almost five decades due to its flexibility and good torque characteristics at low propeller speeds, the older vessels had direct current (DC) propulsion motors which were very heavy and bulky at such power levels. Although it would have been possible to use two smaller DC motors in tandem, recent advances in drive and control technology as well as excellent experiences from a prototype <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Finnish research vessel Aranda were in favor of the new type of propulsion system.

The maximum power is available at propeller speeds ranging from 115 to 220rpm to both directions and at lower speeds the propulsion motors are capable of providing 130% of the rated torque to prevent the four-bladed stainless steel propellers from jamming in severe ice conditions. The bollard pull of Otso is 160tons.|$|E

50|$|In the S-lay system, the {{pipeline}} assembly is {{done at the}} <b>installation</b> site, <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc. The S notation refers {{to the shape of}} {{the pipeline}} as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (touch down point). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support. But it may have to contend with severe sea states - these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding. Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an effort}} to renew his Peninsular Campaign, General George McClellan {{requested}} a squadron to force its way up the James River and threaten Richmond from the water. To fulfill this request, North Atlantic Blockading Squadron commander, Flag Officer Louis Goldsborough, assigned Commodore John Rodgers the command of the James River Squadron, which included the navy’s wooden steam gunboats [...] and , the ironclads USS Monitor and , and E.A. Stevens. The Federal warships experienced only minor resistance during their passage up the James River to reach the fortifications at Drewry’s Bluff. On May 15, the battle opened when Rodgers’ flagship Galena approached to within 400 yd of sunken obstructions in the river. The fort was armed with eight heavy naval guns manned by local Confederate land forces and naval personnel (the former crew of the Virginia). Galena received over forty hits of which eighteen penetrated its armor. Monitor was designed for surface naval combat rather than shore bombardment, so its guns could not elevate high enough to hit the fort. Stevens moved up to take its place. The gunboat's technological innovations worked effectively, and she sustained no heavy damage from plunging fire as it sat partly submerged and firing its main battery. Moreover, the gunboat’s ordnance loading system successfully protected the crew from enemy sharpshooters and musket fire. Stevens suffered from the same problem as Monitor, her gun designed to battle warships, not for shore bombardment. Stevens bombardment halted when the 100-pound Parrott rifle burst while firing. The explosion shattered the gun’s breech, damaging the pilothouse and the ship’s deck. Despite losing its main gun, the gunboat continued to fight its 12-pound howitzers with canister and shell. By 11 a.m., Galena had suffered severe damage, exhausted its ammunition, and sustained thirteen dead and many wounded. Rodgers ordered the fleet to retire down river. The Stevens had experienced few casualties despite musket fire, enemy shelling, and its catastrophic gun failure. One of the crew received {{a shot in the}} arm; another suffered a serious contusion. Lt. Constable sustained a head injury from shrapnel from the exploding Parrott gun, but remained at his station directing the broadside guns and commanding the ship throughout the remainder of the battle. The James River Squadron retired to City Point, with Stevens arriving that evening {{and the rest of the}} squadron arriving in the morning of May 16. On the 16th, Rodgers convened a board, composed of squadron officers, to examine the remains of the Parrott rifle and determine the cause of its failure. The board concluded that rigorous testing and experimentation before <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Stevens had weakened the gun, which was the first of its kind produced by the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} Electric Fast Transients (EFT) {{phenomena}} in an Ethernet interface set-up is investigated {{in order to}} get more insight in coupling and interference mechanisms, robustness and susceptibility levels of a typical Ethernet <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> of a naval vessel.

It seems that the protocol is not designed to handle EFT phenomena in an efficient way. We focused on the quality of the interface, i. e. cables, connectors and feed-thoughs. While affordable high quality cable is readily available, it is more difficult to find low cost and robust connectors without a large variability in performance for EMC, but to decouple data handling electronics from disturbing transients is of paramount importance for interference free data communication. As expected, screened cables help to mitigate the interference, but only when the screens are properly connected on both sides...|$|E
40|$|During recent {{research}} activities carried out also {{in collaboration with}} leading industries, the authors have developed design and simulation models for {{the recovery of the}} exhaust thermal energy released from diesel engines. This previous experience is applied, in this paper, to an existing cruise ferry, whose propulsion system consists of two controllable pitch propellers driven, each one, by a couple of four stroke diesel engines. Starting from the available data on the current board systems, a proposal of refitting is presented, based on the comparison of six different waste heat recovery (WHR) plant solutions, optimized in relation to the peculiar requirements of the ship. The steam produced by the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) can be used, depending on the selected configuration, to meet the on board steam needs and/or to contribute to the production of electric energy. The comparison of the proposed solutions, between them and with the simple originally available on board, is carried out taking into account not only the amount of thermal energy recovered and the consequent fuel saving, but also some other important aspects such as the sizes and weights of the WHR plant components and the related problems of <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> <b>board...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another work of Smith’s, Orange Lush (1995), is {{a series}} of several <b>installations</b> of objects <b>on</b> <b>boards.</b> These <b>installations</b> {{contained}} “bright orange plastic objects, among them life-preservers, extension cords, buoys, cheerleader’s pom-poms, water-wings, flip-flops, light bulbs, balloons, and water rafts.” [...] Although the objects seem to be placed randomly, their placement is actually well thought out. There are slight contrasts between rounded objects and objects that are deflated and flattened. This, argues art historian Amanda Boetzkes, is meant to convey “a broader stalemate between sensorial plenitude and economic exhaustion.” Orange Lush performs an aesthetic critique of Mexico’s consumerist economy and the overflowing need for “stuff”. Smith chose the chemical orange color because to her it always screamed “for sale”, which was fitting for the statement she is making about Mexican consumerism. Also, Boetzkes says the color orange “marked the invasion of Mexico City with cheap commodities in the 1990s, after inflation and bailouts from the United States and the Bank for International Settlements caused a devaluation of the peso.” [...] This event describes the exhaustion of economics that Smith tries to bring into her Orange Lush piece. Orange is commonly known as the color of fake value and meaningless products. This is something that Smith calls “chemically induced enthusiasm,” [...] which means it is fabricated happiness or excitement—it is not reality. This is what global consumption is; there is momentary gratification and then it means nothing.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{internal}} volume, often a high density of equipment <b>installations</b> is present <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an aircraft. For this reason, {{in case of}} a device failure, every component installed in close proximity could be damaged, causing a catastrophic domino effect. This paper presents a guided procedure for the Zonal Safety Analysis (ZSA) performed during the airplane conceptual design. This methodology allows aerospace engineers to carry out a devices <b>installation</b> <b>on</b> the aircraft taking into account the possible interactions among them in case of failure. In the Zonal Safety Analysis methodology, each equipment is characterized by a risk score, evaluating various types of accidents, for example mechanical breaks, electric damages, explosions. Considering every installed device and the possible spread of damages, a global risk score is obtained, which should be minimized in order to obtain a safer project as possible. In order to allow the engineer to conduct a Zonal Safety Analysis, a computer-aided software based on the ZSA methodology has been realized and presented in this paper. Thanks to a Graphical User Interface (GUI), many trade-off studies can be rapidly carried out and the safest solution can be designed. First, the tool requires the user to define the bays in which the aircraft is partitioned. Then, for each zone, the engineer selects all the equipment (e. g. avionic devices, electric generators, actuators, pumps) to be installed. These components and relative risk scores are included in a database compiled within the tool. Once every equipment has been selected, the risk level of every zone is evaluated, taking into account the possible interactions among all the close systems. Finally, the tool estimates the global risk score. All the results are shown to the user by means of tables and graphs. The engineer should comply the necessary changes (e. g. varying components location) in order to obtain a better design from a safety point of view. In the final part of the paper, a test case of the Zonal Safety Analysis methodology applied to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is presented. The obtained results are reported and discussed. This example demonstrates that the realized software can be useful to conduct a preliminary design a safer airplan...|$|R
