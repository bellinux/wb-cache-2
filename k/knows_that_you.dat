5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2013 SPIN {{magazine}} article—a reflection at the ten-year {{anniversary of}} Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was [...] "a sick man without his medicine" [...] {{during the last}} 31 days of his life, {{when he was not}} only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please consider your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E

5000|$|This epistemic closure {{principle}} {{is central to}} many versions of skeptical arguments. A skeptical argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the brain in a vat scenario or the cartesian evil demon scenario. A skeptic might say, for example, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you are not handless, and if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not handless, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat).
