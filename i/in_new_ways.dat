He is part of Team 10 alongside Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. He is a highly unenthusiastic person, and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort. Contrary to his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent; his teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, determined that Shikamaru's IQ was over 200. Shikamaru's abilities {{are based on the}} , the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent's shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru's movements. As the series progresses, Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways.</b> By Part II of the series, Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow-based techniques at once and can lift his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects; for instance, he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons.|$|E
5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways.</b> It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot {{over the course of a}} year while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E

25|$|Lexical {{modernization}} {{has also}} been critical {{to the development of}} Quechua.

In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.|$|E
25|$|Currently, negative-index {{metamaterials}} {{are being}} developed to manipulate electromagnetic radiation <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways.</b> For example, optical and electromagnetic properties of natural materials are often altered through chemistry. With metamaterials, optical and electromagnetic properties can be engineered by changing the geometry of its unit cells. The unit cells are materials that are ordered in geometric arrangements with dimensions that are fractions of the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic wave. Each artificial unit responds to the radiation from the source. The collective result is the material's response to the electromagnetic wave that is broader than normal.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the corset has {{experienced}} periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in haute couture and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion.

25|$|Plato's Republic and Parmenides. The {{principles}} {{ascribed to}} Plato in the indirect tradition make {{many of the}} statements and trains of thought in these two dialogues appear in a different light. Interpreted accordingly, they contribute to sharpening the contours of our image of the unwritten doctrines. The debates in other dialogues, for example, the Timaeus and the Philebus, can then be understood <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> and incorporated into the Tübingen reconstruction. Allusions to the unwritten doctrines can even be found, it is argued, in Plato's early dialogues.|$|E

It also made possible nomadic pastoralism in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the dromedary and Bactrian camel. Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.|$|E
25|$|Floating {{exchange}} rates made life more complicated for bond traders, including those at Salomon Brothers in New York City. By {{the middle of}} the 1970s, encouraged by the head of bond research at Salomon, Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways.</b> Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the short end—yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the long end.|$|E
25|$|These {{classes are}} {{generally}} organized {{so that students}} {{have the opportunity to}} choose several courses they wish to participate in.

These courses are designed to challenge the students to think <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.|$|E

25|$|First {{identified}} at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925, {{art deco}} shares some characteristics of expressionism {{and is likely}} to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement - particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus - and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with art nouveau and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel.

25|$|For {{most of its}} history, Afro-Cuban jazz {{had been}} a matter of {{superimposing}} jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But {{by the end of the}} 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both salsa dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass). During 1974–1976, they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways.</b> He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.|$|E
