40|$|LANDER is a {{computer}} program used to predict the trajectory and flight performance of a spacecraft ascending or descending between a low lunar orbit of 15 to 500 nautical miles (nm) and the lunar surface. It is a three degree-of-freedom simulation {{which is used to}} analyze the translational motion of the vehicle during descent. Attitude dynamics and rotational motion are not considered. The program can be used to simulate either an ascent from the Moon or a descent to the Moon. For an ascent, the spacecraft is initialized at the lunar surface and accelerates vertically away from the ground at full thrust. When the local velocity becomes 30 ft/s, the vehicle turns downrange with a pitch-over maneuver and proceeds to fly a gravity turn until Main Engine Cutoff (MECO). The spacecraft then coasts until it reaches the requested <b>holding</b> <b>orbit</b> where it performs an orbital insertion burn. During a descent simulation, the lander begins in the <b>holding</b> <b>orbit</b> and performs a deorbit burn. It then coasts to pericynthion, where it reignites its engines and begins a gravity turn descent.

40|$|A {{test program}} is {{undertaken}} {{to verify that}} the lifetime of a shuttle launchable dewar can be increased by using passive orbital disconnect struts (PODS). A detailed design is performed on the cold end (PODS-III) portion of the strut. Structural analysis of the thin-wall fiberglass tube allows selection of the optimum winding angle and tube dimensions. Structural tests on the thin-wall fiberglass tube measure both the tension and compression modulus at ambient and LN 2 temperatures, the radial deflection versus side load, and the ultimate compression strength of the tube at LN 2 temperature. The thermal expansion of the fiberglass tube plus Invar is also measured down to 78 K. The axial gap at the wedge portion of the stem is set based on these data. The PODS-III test article parts are fabricated and assembled using a detailed assembly procedure. The thermal conductants in the orbital configuration was measured for body temperatures between 5 and 40 K.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{generating}} pseudo-random sequences of d-dimensional vectors is considered; {{it is based}} on the ergodic theory of periodic orbits in the sense of [2] for unstable dynamical systems such as the hyperbolic automorphisms of the d-dimensional Torus. Since these systems enjoy strong chaotic properties, their orbits are both dense and chaotic in some sense, however the ergodic property <b>holds</b> only for <b>orbits</b> having initial points with irrational coordinates, the remaining ones being periodic. Unfortunately, those orbits are the only ones that a computer is able to generate. Since a pseudo-random sequence in [0, 1] d is a long periodic orbit which has chaotic behaviour similar in some sense to the one of aperiodic orbits, in this note, we shall prove lower and upper bounds for the length of the period of orbits of the hyperbolic automorphisms of the d-dimensional Torus, expressed in terms of the (rational) starting point. The algorithms proposed are free of computational error, since they work in integer arithmetic. Surprisingly the elimination of the round off errors turns out in an increase of the length of the period. Statistical testing and the problem of estimating the discrepancy of the obtained sequences are also treated. Â© 1992 Instituto di Elaborazione della Informazione del CNR...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that Comet 72 P/Denning–Fujikawa is an old and {{intermittently}} active comet evolving, at least observationally, towards a transitional minor planet status. We have studied the fate of hypothetical meteoroids ejected from the comet during its two known periods of activity (1881 and 1978). A complex history of orbital evolution is found. Meteoroids ejected in 1881 first become Earth-orbit-crossing in 1960, while meteoroids ejected in 1978 appear to <b>hold</b> stable, non-Earth-orbit-crossing <b>orbits</b> until at least 2110. If copious amounts of meteoroids were ejected in 1881 we find some indication that the Earth may encounter a populous, coherent subgroup, or ‘streamlet’, of them in 2009 and 2010, leading {{to the possibility of}} outburst activity in those years. We have investigated the possibility that the activity of Comet 72 P/Denning–Fujikawa, over the past, 200 years, has been governed by impacts suffered by the comet as it moves through the main-belt asteroid region. While encounters with centimetre-sized objects will take place each time the comet orbits the Sun, the likelihood of the comet encountering a large metre-sized asteroid is essentially zero on the time-scales considered. The outburst activity of the comet may be impact-modulated in the sense that small-object impacts might trigger the explosive release of gases trapped in subsurface cavities...|$|R
40|$|The {{multipurpose}} hydrogen {{test bed}} (MHTB), with an 18 -cu m liquid hydrogen tank, {{was used to}} evaluate a combination foam/multilayer combination insulation (MLI) concept. The foam element (Isofoam SS- 1171) insulates during ground hold/ascent flight, and allowed a dry nitrogen purge as opposed to the more complex/heavy helium purge subsystem normally required. The 45 -layer MLI was designed for an on-orbit storage period of 45 days. Unique WI features include a variable layer density, larger but fewer double-aluminized Mylar perforations for ascent to orbit venting, and a commercially established roll-wrap installation process that reduced assembly man-hours and resulted in a roust, virtually seamless MLI. Insulation performance was measured during three test series. The spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) successfully prevented purge gas liquefaction within the MLI and resulted in the expected ground hold heat leak of 63 W/sq m. The <b>orbit</b> <b>hold</b> tests resulted in heat leaks of 0. 085 and 0. 22 W/sq m with warm boundary temperatures of 164 and 305 K, respectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the Kepler M dwarf planet hosts, with a particular focus on the fractional number of systems hosting multiple transiting planets. We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler yield. We recover the observed number of systems containing between 2 and 5 transiting planets if every M dwarf hosts 6. 1 +/- 1. 9 planets with typical mutual inclinations of 2. 0 + 4. 0 - 2. 0 degrees. This range includes the Solar System in its coplanarity and multiplicity. However, similar to studies of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report {{that the number of}} singly-transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems: a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 55 + 23 - 12 % of planetary systems are either single or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. Thus, we find that the so-called "Kepler dichotomy" <b>holds</b> for planets <b>orbiting</b> M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars. Additionally, we compare stellar properties of the hosts to single and multiple transiting planets. For the brightest subset of stars in our sample we find intriguing, yet marginally significant evidence that stars hosting multiply-transiting systems are rotating more quickly, are closer to the midplane of the Milky Way, and are comparatively metal poor. This preliminary finding warrants further investigation. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of high energy cryogenic upper stages {{is essential for}} the efficient delivery of large payloads to various destinations envisioned in future programs. A key element in such upper stages is cryogenic fluid management (CFM) advanced development/technology. Due to the cost of and limited opportunities for orbital experiments, ground testing must be employed to the fullest extent possible. Therefore, a system level test bed termed the Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB), which is representative in size and shape (3 meter diameter by 3 meter long with a volume of 18 cubic meters) of a fully integrated space transportation vehicle liquid hydrogen propellant tank has been established. To date, upper stage studies have often baselined the foam/multilayer insulation (FMLI) combination concept; however, hardware experience with the concept is minimal and was therefore selected for the MHTB. The foam element (isofoam SS- 1 171 with an average thickness of 3. 5 centimeters) is designed to protect against ground hold/ascent flight environments, and allows for the use of a dry nitrogen purge as opposed to the more complex/heavy helium purge subsystem normally required with MLI in cryogenic applications. The MLI (45 layers of Double Aluminized Mylar with Dacron spacers) provides protection in the vacuum environment of space and is designed for an on-orbit storage period of 45 days. Several unique features were incorporated in the MLI concept and included: variable density MLI (reduces weight and radiation losses by changing the layer density), larger but fewer DAM perforations for venting during ascent to orbit (reduces radiation losses), and roll wrap installation of the MLI with a commercially established process to lower assembly man-hours and reduce seam heat leak. Thermal performance testing of the MHTB TCS was conducted during three test series conducted between September 1995 and May 1996. Results for the ground hold portion of the tests were as expected producing an average heat leak of 63 WattS/M 2 at an average foam surface temperature of 170 K. The results of the simulated <b>orbit</b> <b>hold</b> test interval produced heat leaks ranging from 0. 085 to 0. 22 Watts/squareM at warm boundary temperatures of 164 K and 305 K, respectively. When compared to the performance for a traditional MLI system, a 60 % reduction in orbital heat leak or boiloff was measured. Overall, the MHTB TCS demonstrated satisfactory performance for all mission phases required of a cryogenic upper stage...|$|R
