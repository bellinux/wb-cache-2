40|$|Introduction: Aerosolisation of {{components}} when processing king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (Cancer pagurus) may cause occupational health problems when inhaled by workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} in three king crab plants and one <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant. Personal exposure measurements were performed throughout work shifts. Air was collected for measurement of tropomyosin, total protein, endotoxin, trypsin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase). T-tests and ANOVAs were used to compare the levels of exposure in the different plants and areas in the plants. Results: Total protein and tropomyosin levels were highest in the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant, endotoxin levels were highest in king crab plants. King crab exposure levels were highest during raw processing. Tropomyosin levels were highest during raw king crab processing with geometric mean (GM) 9. 6 ng/m 3 vs 2. 5 ng/m 3 during cooked processing. Conversely, <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> tropomyosin levels were highest during cooked processing with GM 45. 4 ng/m 3 vs 8. 7 ng/m 3 during raw processing. Endotoxin levels were higher in king crab plants than in the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant with GM= 6285. 5 endotoxin units (EU) /m 3 vs 72 EU/m 3. In the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plant, NAGase levels were highest during raw processing with GM= 853 pmol 4 - methylumbelliferone (MU) /m 3 vs 422 pmol 4 -MU/m 3 during cooked processing. Trypsin activity was found in both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> plants and levels were higher in raw than cooked processing. Differences in exposure levels between plants and worker groups (raw and cooked processing) were identified Conclusions: Norwegian crab processing workers are exposed to airborne proteins, tropomyosin, endotoxins, trypsin and NAGase in their breathing zone.

40|$|Occupational {{asthma and}} allergy are health {{problems}} {{found in the}} seafood processing industry. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} exposure to central components in bioaerosols collected in the breathing zone of crab processing workers, and explore the workers’ prevalence of respiratory symptoms and sensitisation to crustacean allergens. This thesis describes the exposure levels of total protein, tropomyosin, trypsin, NAGase and endotoxin in king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing plants. This work establishes that both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing workers are exposed to bioaerosols containing these components. When comparing king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing, king crab processing results in highest levels of endotoxin while <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> processing has the highest levels of tropomyosin and total protein. Differences in exposure levels between the king crab processing plants suggesting a plant effect where local differences in production, ventilation and plant layout is important for the exposure to bioaerosols. This work also describes the increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms among crab processing workers compared to a non-exposed control group. However, there is little difference between exposed workers and controls in lung function parameters. The control group has an increased prevalence of self-reported asthma and allergy compared to the crab processing workers. Furthermore, this work demonstrates elevated IgE and positive skin prick test results among both king <b>crab</b> and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> workers. Immunoblots also show that workers are sensitised to several allergens, including tropomyosin, arginine kinase, enolase and hemocyanin. The low prevalence of asthma and allergy despite the presence of respiratory symptoms and sensitisation suggests a healthy worker effect where unhealthy individuals are excluded from the workforce. It causes an underestimation of the health effects of working in the plant...|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of Small’s (2012) studies, 38 host {{crustacean}} species {{have been affected by}} Hematodinium parasites. Some of the economically-important infected hosts include tanner and snow crabs from the Northeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, blue crabs in the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, Norwegian lobsters, and <b>Edible</b> <b>crabs</b> from Europe. It is anticipated that the geographical spread of Hematodinium will grow and reach various other aquatic regions globally due to oceanic currents, host movements and habitat expansions, as well as transportation vessels. Furthermore, as new crustacean species are targeted and fished as commercial seafood, new species of pathogens may be discovered. This was the case in a recent finding in multiple Asian crustacean farm facilities. Small (2012) notes that only aquaculture species from southern and eastern China have been documented, which include swimming crab P. trituberculatus, the mud crab S. serrata, and the ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda. In addition, a small new finding of Hematodinium parasites in crustaceans was also recently discovered in Russian waters.|$|E

50|$|Cadgwith was {{established}} in medieval times {{as a collection of}} fishing cellars in a sheltered south-east facing coastal valley with a shingle cove to subsidise local farmers' livelihoods by fishing Cadgwith was originally called Caswydh or Porthcaswydh (thought to be derived from the Cornish word for 'a thicket'; probably because the valley was densely wooded). From the 16th century, the village became inhabited, with fishing as the main occupation. Subsequently buildings were established as homes, lofts, capstan houses, and cellars constructed of local stone or cob walls, and thatched or slated roofs; which were built along the beach and up the sides of the valley leading to Cadgwith's characteristic Cornish fishing village appearance. Cadgwith owes its existence to the fishing industry. Pilchard fishing occurred until the 1950s using large seine boats and seine nets, which was a system used to enclose the large shoals of pilchards, and coordinated by the use of lookouts, known as huers (from the Cornish 'Hevva, Hevva!'

5000|$|After Hunstanton is Old Hunstanton. The road {{continues}} {{around the}} coast, {{following the same}} sand covered beach {{as the one in}} Heacham. From Hunstanton to Brancaster is 13 miles long. The road narrows slightly, it is still a single carriage road, with 2 directions. The road this time does not bypass the villages, but goes through them, providing access to the village. The villages here often contain independent restaurants, shops and grocery stores. Pubs are a common feature here too.The proceeding village to Old Hunstanton is Holme-Next-The-Sea, a coastal village situated on marshes and Creakes where boats are often sailed. Beyond the marsh is a large sand dune, known as [...] "Holme Dunes". Part of this is protected by the NWT (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) as a protection for species that nest here. Being situated next to the North Sea, many birds come and migrate for the summer or winter here. At Holme Dunes, there have been sightings of the wryneck and even the extremely rare Ruppell's warbler. Also protected are natterjack toads, <b>edible</b> <b>crabs</b> and waders. Holme is also the end of Peddars Way and is the junction with the Norfolk Coast Path. Following this ancient Roman Road southbound will bring you to Thetford passing through the Brecklands. Peddars Way may have run to Branodunum, a Roman fort along this road.Following Holme's Main Road is the village of Thornham. The name of the road here is High Street, as it is the main road through the village. Separating Holme and Thornham are the marshes. There is a small staithe here, as there is throughout the north-west Norfolk area. Thornham village has access to the staithe via Staithe Road, which connects to the A149. Crabs nest in the muddy banks in the creeks, and when there is High Tide, the marsh often floods and the banks of these rivers overflow. The village and road is protected by farmland either side.The village of Thornham is approximately 1 mile long and hosts an independent delicatessen and cafe along with a pick your own fruit farm cum orchard.About 2 miles on is Titchwell. There is an RSPB reserve here that has been featured in the BBCs Springwatch. The Norfolk Coastal path runs through this village further towards the beach, and has been transformed into an embankment as coastal defence. This continues through North Norfolk to beyond Cromer. This acts as protection to the rising tides, and flooding. On the beach, prehistoric forests can be seen at low tide, and archaeological digs have found mesolithic flint submerged. In Titchwell Marsh and on the beach, medieval pottery has also been found. Sightings at Titchwell Marsh have been marsh harriers and bitterns Like in Snettisham, a list of [...] "star species" [...] has been compiled.Not far along the A149 is the village of Brancaster, a Roman town with the name Branodunum, meaning [...] "Fortress of Bran". This was a place of Roman importance, and may have been where footpath, Peddars Way led. Now, the village marshes are owned by the National Trust and are kept as conservation areas. There is a long beach, and access to Titchwell beach is restricted due to a large creek. The sand beach is one that again, spans the length of the coast. Tides are strong and there is a memorial to the death of Jake Parker, 5, who drowned near the village.Brancaster currently hosts a pub, church and hotel.|$|E

40|$|Regular {{consumption}} of seafood {{has been widely}} recommended by authorities. Yet, some species accumulate high levels of contaminants like Hg, Cd and As. In addition, the risks associated to the {{consumption of}} such seafood may increase if consumers use cooking practices that enhance the concentration of contaminants and their bioaccessibility. In this study, the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As was assessed with in vitro human digestion of raw and cooked black scabbard fish (Hg; steamed, fried and grilled) and <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (Cd and As; steamed and boiled) tissues. Additionally, the toxicological hazards associated with the consumption of these products were also discussed. Generally, Hg, Cd and As bioacessibility increased throughout the digestion process. Cadmium and As revealed high bioaccessibility rates in raw and cooked samples (up to 100 %), whereas lower bioaccessible fractions of Hg was observed (up to 40 %). Furthermore, this study pointed out the importance of food matrix, elemental chemical properties and cooking practices in the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As. The toxicological hazards revealed that <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> brown meat (Cd) and grilled black scabbard fish (MeHg) consumption in children should be moderated. In contrast, <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> muscle (Cd) and fried or steamed black scabbard fish (MeHg) should be consumed to minimize exposure.
