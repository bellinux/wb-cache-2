5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she <b>is</b> <b>content</b> to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik <b>is</b> <b>content</b> to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|A port to iOS devices {{done by the}} 2K China {{studio was}} {{released}} on August 27, 2014. The iOS version <b>is</b> <b>content</b> complete and functionally equivalent to the original Xbox 360 and Windows version, featuring either the use of touch-screen virtual gamepad controls {{or the use of}} a Bluetooth-enabled controller, and with a graphics engine optimized for iOS devices. The game was later delisted from the App Store in September 2015; the game had become unplayable for many that upgraded to iOS 8.4 on their devices, and while a patch had been discussed, a 2K representative stated that the decision to remove the game came from the developer. 2K later clarified that they will be working on resolving the issues with the game's compatibility with the new firmware and will re-release the title once that has been completed. However, by January 2017, 2K officially stated that it will no longer support the title, the game will remain on the App Store, but will not receive additional updates.|$|E

5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child <b>is</b> <b>content</b> with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{receives}} a text from Robert California (James Spader) inviting {{him on the}} trip to Tallahassee. After unsuccessfully trying to back out via text, Jim and Pam both agree Jim should just go. During Jim's request session with Andy and Dwight, Jim shows the texts from California, shocking both Andy and Dwight, making it all but official that Jim {{will be going to}} Tallahassee. The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight. At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds, but after realizing they all have excellent ideas for the project, he <b>is</b> <b>content</b> with the team.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but <b>is</b> <b>content</b> to spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his school friends have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E

5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog <b>is</b> <b>content</b> {{with a small amount of}} space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.|$|E
5|$|When Love Was Blind is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on young blind woman, May Read, who is saved from her burning home by Frank Larson. In the act of saving her, Frank is disfigured, but the two fall and love, marry and have a child. Two years later, the family physician offers to restore May's sight through a surgery. Frank consents despite his fears that May will not love him if she gazes upon his disfigured face. The surgery is a success and the doctor tells May not to remove the bandages. May ignores this warning and is permanently blinded after attempting to gaze at her husband, but she <b>is</b> <b>content</b> knowing her baby is beautiful. Directed by Lucius J. Henderson and starred Lucille Younge, the film was a critical success. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she <b>is</b> <b>content</b> with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

He is very good at cards and billiards, and although he does not always win he is able to earn cash by betting against less talented gamblers. He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he <b>is</b> <b>content</b> to let Becky manage his career.|$|E

While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He <b>is</b> <b>content</b> with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E
25|$|Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) {{encounters}} Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, <b>is</b> <b>content</b> {{and curious}} about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems {{not only more}} reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly {{due to the fact}} that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled. Tyler discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts to sell to make a living. Tyler demonstrates a trick he has learned: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, he can imitate a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return <b>is</b> <b>content</b> to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E
