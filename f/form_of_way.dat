[...] For example, just one day after the tsunami, on 27 December 2004, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland reportedly categorised the contributions of rich countries as [...] "stingy". This was widely misinterpreted in the media as categorising the overall response to the tsunami whereas Mr Egeland later explained that at the time he had been making a general remark about overall global aid flows in recent years. Speaking at a press conference later Mr. Egeland said, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} any particular country or the response to this emergency. We are in early days and the response has so far been overwhelmingly positive". The U.S. government, led by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, added another US$20 million on 28 December to the original U.S pledge of US$15 million, bringing the total up to US$35 million (not including direct aid rendered by naval vessels dispatched to the region). Initially, the U.S. Navy dispatched P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and an aircraft carrier to assist with relief operations.|$|E

5000|$|His {{effective}} teleport range {{had been}} extended after his revival both thanks to outside assistance and a later enhancement to his powers, {{thanks to a}} deal he made with a demonic race of Bamfs loaned {{to him by his}} father. Nightcrawler can warp greater distances by locking onto them as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> point marker in order to teleport longer distances even trans-dimensional ones. Beyond the use of his own demonic companions Kurt can now seemingly transport himself longer distances without tiring, be they local or continental in range having teleported over 7853 mi from the UAE (United Arab Emirates) to Antarctica, and again traveling 2936 mi from Prague all the way to Al-Qasr in Egypt. He possesses a limited unconscious extrasensory [...] "spatial awareness" [...] ability which prevents him from teleporting into solid objects within his immediate vicinity, but this ability diminishes the greater the distance he teleports. Because teleporting into other solid matter would cause severe injury or death, he will only teleport to an area he is familiar with or that he can clearly see at the time or has seen in the past. His power automatically displaces liquids and gases when he arrives.|$|E
