40|$|The area of Niná Niná, in whiche {{only one}} iron-ore mining plant is {{operating}} in Slovakia, namely Siderit, Ltd., is well-known by its mining activities from long-ago. In the past a main interest {{was focused on}} gold, copper, mercury and {{from the beginning of}} the 20 th century also on iron. Thus, thermal technologies are applied in the production of Fe-concentrates and finally of blast furnace pellets, which are suitable for metallurgical processing. An operation of such technologies is often connected with the pollution of air and through this factor also in the contamination of other components of environment. The emission situation is observed by suitable monitoring systems. But, as to immisions a little information is available during the last period. An improvement came from the cooperation between the Siderite plant and the Institute of Geotechnics SAV. The Institute carry out the observation of the <b>immission</b> <b>load</b> of selected environmental factors from the viewpoint of solid pollutants, dustiness, SO 2, As a Hg. Recently, the dustfall is monitored on 17 sampling points in the surrounding of the plant. On the basis of obtained results of monitoring, it can be stated that the <b>immission</b> <b>load</b> gradually decreases during the last observed period...|$|E
30|$|In {{the years}} 1970, 1980, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2010, lichen mapping {{in the towns}} of Wetzlar and Giessen in Hesse was performed. The aim was to show the effects of <b>immission</b> <b>load.</b> Despite the {{application}} of modified test methods during the study period, the results can still be compared directly because they could be adapted {{to the requirements of}} the guidelines of the Association of German Engineers. Even the earlier study results could be interpreted partly within the scope of the guidelines. Parallel to the lichen mapping, comparative examinations of pH on tree bark were carried out.|$|E
40|$|Dieback of spruce stands was {{studied in}} the regions Kysuce and Spiš (Slovakia). Possible causes of spruce decline were {{analysed}} through observations of the following characteristics: genetic background, provenience, influence of root system, physiological processes (photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, content of pigments), water stress, climatic conditions, soil condition, <b>immission</b> <b>load,</b> diameter increment, defoliation, and influence of fungal pathogens and insects. Our research results do not allow identifying a single primary cause of spruce decline. Separate factors act in concert, {{and it is not}} possible to rank them according to their significance. In general, however, there is an evident strong influence of biotic pests, wind, exhausted soil and impaired physiological fitness since young trees. A special interest was put on monitoring possible influence of drought stress. Across the whole research period we have not recorded noticeable drops in amounts of soil water accessible for plants. Nevertheless, we suppose that importance of this factor will grade, especially in areas relatively rich in precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The health {{conditions}} of the assimilation apparatus of forest stands can be evaluated also by means of studies on changes {{in the content of}} epicuticular waxes, which create an interface between the plant and environment and which as the first ones are damaged by immissions. Within the last decade the immission spectrum in the territory of the Czech Republic has markedly changed. Atmospheric concentrations of sulphur oxides decreased and this was the main cause of an improvement in the health condition of the Norway spruce (Picea abies /L. / Karst.) assimilation apparatus. However, in the following period a marked increase in concentrations of ground-level ozone, which is at present considered to be the most serious cause of an impairment of the health condition of forest woody species in forest stands growing in altitudes above 900 m. In these localities there is a repeated decrease in amounts of epicuticular waxes on the surface of needles, which is manifested in the health condition of the assimilation apparatus of affected conifers. Epicuticular waxes {{can be used as a}} natural bioindicator of the <b>immission</b> <b>load</b> in those regions where the evaluated forest stands are situated...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of anthropogenic <b>immission</b> <b>load</b> of area is important indicator {{in the process}} of immission participation determination to agricultural crop detraction. Despite the rapid concentration detraction of all immissions in the air environment dominates the opinion, that it continues in latent scale of damaging in the economically significant scale. Demonstration of this effect scale is economically and technically difficult. That is why the indirect methods of load assessment are developed, whereas the level of their validity is the cardinal inefficiency. Determination of concentrations of pollutants recognized methods are costly and labour-consuming and are also linked to energy networks. In the present work we follow the content of SO 2 in the atmosphere because of their greatest contribution to atmospheric pollution. Their objectives is based on selected methods simply set the load area of sulphur and nitrogen transformation of the volume concentration of SO 2 the deposition rate and replace the costly and labour intensive methods. In this paper we compare two direct methods sorption-cumulative and chemiluminescence. The amounts of SO 2 observed sorption-cumulative method in the individual periods was several times higher than the amount measured by AMS Leles. Results showed relatively large differences between different methods. The above methods can replace costly and labour intensive methods...|$|E
30|$|The use of lichens as bioindicators {{to assess}} air {{pollution}} {{has been a}} long tradition in Europe. Nevertheless, there are rare long-term mappings of lichens under standardized conditions. Comparative assessments of the air pollution situation are also hardly possible; as in previous studies, different methods have been observed, and the transfer to modern, regulated and standardized methods[1] fails as the original data are no longer available. The towns of Central Hesse, Giessen and Wetzlar, represent a positive exception from these points: they have been mapped repeatedly at irregular intervals since 1970, and the original survey data of the respective investigations are still available. In our study areas, the surveys were not all conducted using the same methodology. Thus, in the first mapping in 1970 for example, it was only distinguished whether crustose, foliose or fruticose lichens could be found on the studied trees[2, 3]. Therefore, we can only make a statement about those areas where only crustose lichens occurred, which at that time was almost exclusively the acid-enduring and toxitolerant species of Lecanora conizaeoides. The sole occurrence of this species indicates, by the standards of today's Association of German Engineers (VDI) guideline interpretation, an extremely high <b>immission</b> <b>load</b> with acidic pollutant gases - primarily SO 2. Besides the recording of the lichen vegetation from 1970 in Giessen and 1985 in Wetzlar, measurements of the pH of the bark of the mapped trees were made, so that, in this case, a comparison with our current studies of 2010 was possible[4 – 7].|$|E
