Increased levels of LDLR would lead to reduced cholesterol levels and contribute to strategies designed to treat hypercholesterolemia. We have previously shown that <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> complementary to transcription start sites can associate with noncoding transcripts and activate gene expression. Here we show that <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> complementary to the promoter of LDLR activate expression of LDLR and increase the display of LDLR on the surface of liver cells. Activation requires complementarity to the LDLR promoter and can be achieved by chemically modified <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Promoter-targeted <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> can overcome repression of LDLR expression by 25 -hydroxycholesterol and do not interfere with activation of LDLR expression by lovastatin.

Previously we showed that S. cerevisiae RNase H 1 binds to <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> (either RNA-DNA hybrids or {{double-stranded}} RNA) through a region related to the double-stranded RNA binding motif. A very similar amino acid sequence is present in caulimovirus ORF VI proteins. The hallmark of the RNase H/caulimovirus nucleic acid binding motif is a stretch of 40 amino acids with 11 highly conserved residues, seven of which are aromatic. Point mutations, insertions and deletions indicated that integrity of the motif is important for binding. However, additional amino acids are required because a minimal peptide containing the motif was disordered in solution and failed to bind to <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs,</b> whereas a longer protein bound well. Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNase H 1 also bound to <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs,</b> as did proteins in which the S. cerevisiae RNase H 1 binding motif was replaced by either the C. fasciculata or by the cauliflower mosaic virus ORF VI sequence.

An ideal silencing agent would block {{expression of}} mutant HTT while leaving expression of wild-type HTT intact. We observe that fully complementary <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> targeting the expanded CAG repeat within HTT mRNA block expression of both alleles. Switching the RNAi mechanism toward that used by miRNAs by introducing one or more mismatched bases into these <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> leads to potent (30 -fold relative to wild-type HTT) inhibition of mutant HTT expression in patient-derived cells.

We measured ATP utilization and <b>duplex</b> <b>RNA</b> unwinding by DbpA, a non-processive bacterial DEAD-box RNA helicase specifically activated by the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23 S rRNA. Consumption of a single ATP molecule is sufficient to unwind and displace an 8 base pair rRNA strand annealed to a 32 base pair PTC-RNA “mother strand” fragment. Strand displacement occurs after ATP binding and hydrolysis but before Pi product release.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder that currently has no curative treatments. DRPLA {{is caused by}} an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat region within the protein-encoding sequence of the atrophin- 1 (ATN- 1) gene. Inhibition of mutant ATN- 1 protein expression is one strategy for treating DRPLA, and allele-selective gene silencing agents that block mutant expression over wild-type expression would be lead compounds for therapeutic development. Here we develop an assay for distinguishing mutant from wild-type ATN- 1 protein by gel electrophoresis. We use this assay to evaluate <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> and single-stranded silencing RNAs (ss-siRNAs) for allele-selective inhibition of ATN- 1 protein expression. We observed potent and allele-selective inhibition by <b>RNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> that contain mismatched bases relative to the CAG target and {{have the potential to}} form miRNA-like complexes. ss-siRNAs that contained mismatches were as selective as mismatch-containing duplexes.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{appreciated}} that gene expression is regulated by protein complexes at promoters. More recently, {{research has demonstrated that}} small <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> such as micro-RNAs and short interfering RNAs complementary to mRNA provide another layer of regulation. Evidence now supports the existence of regulatory pathways that use small <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> to control transcription. Synthetic RNAs complementary to gene promoters [antigene RNAs (agRNAs) ] can either activate or inhibit gene expression. Activity of agRNAs is mediated by argonaute, a protein required for RNA interference. Unlike protein transcription factors, agRNAs do not bind to chromosomal DNA but recognize noncoding transcripts that overlap gene promoters or 3 ′-gene termini. This review describes recent studies with agRNAs and focuses on the robust and potent agRNA-mediated regulation of progesterone receptor.

40|$|Ribosome binding to mRNA {{requires}} the concerted action of three initiation factors, eIF- 4 A, eIF- 4 B, and eIF- 4 F, and the hydrolysis of ATP in a mechanism {{that is not}} well understood. Several lines of evidence support a model by which these factors bind to the 5 ' end of mRNA and unwind proximal secondary structure, thus allowing 40 S ribosomal subunits to bind. We have previously used an unwinding assay to demonstrate that eIF- 4 A or eIF- 4 F in combination with eIF- 4 B functions as an RNA helicase. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of RNA unwinding, we used a mobility shift electrophoresis assay which allows the simultaneous analysis of unwinding and complex formation between these factors and RNA. eIF- 4 F forms a stable complex (complex A) with <b>duplex</b> <b>RNA</b> {{in the absence of}} ATP. Addition of eIF- 4 B results in the formation of a second complex (complex B) of slower mobility in the gel. In the presence of ATP, both complexes dissociate, concomitant with the unwinding of the <b>duplex</b> <b>RNA.</b> We present evidence to suggest that unwinding occurs in a processive as opposed to distributive manner. Thus, we conclude that helicase complexes that are formed in the absence of ATP on <b>duplex</b> <b>RNA</b> translocate processively along the RNA in an ATP-dependent reaction and melt secondary structure. These helicase complexes therefore represent intermediates in the unwinding process of mRNA that could precede ribosome binding...|$|E
40|$|A protein-protein {{interaction}} {{within the}} helicase {{domain of the}} Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126 - and 183 -kDa replicase proteins was previously implicated in virus replication (S. Goregaoker, D. Lewandowski, and J. Culver, Virology 282 : 320 - 328, 2001). To further characterize the interaction, polypeptides covering the interacting portions of the TMV helicase domain were expressed and purified. Biochemical characterizations demonstrated that the helicase domain polypeptides hydrolyzed ATP and bound both single-stranded and <b>duplexed</b> <b>RNA</b> in an ATP-controlled fashion.

Biochemically active helicase polypeptides were shown by gel filtration to form high-molecular-weight complexes.

The potential for <b>duplex</b> <b>RNAs</b> to control expression in the nucleus has received less attention. Here, we investigate the ability of small RNAs to redirect splicing.

Those with tRNA or <b>duplex</b> <b>RNA</b> are larger than with single-stranded RNA, and comparable in size to protein–DNA interfaces. The protein side bears a strong positive electrostatic potential and resembles protein–DNA interfaces in its amino acid composition.

On average, protein–RNA interfaces contain 20 hydrogen bonds, 7 that involve the phosphates, 5 the sugar 2 ’OH, and 6 the bases, and 32 water molecules.

Here we employ hydrogen/deuterium ex-change coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe the apo states of RIG-I and MDA 5 and to dissect the molecular details with respect to distinct RNA species recognition, ATP binding and hydroly-sis and CARDs activation.

40|$|AbstractBackground: During pre-mRNA splicing, dynamic {{rearrangement}} of RNA {{secondary structure}} within the spliceosome {{is crucial for}} intron recognition and formation of the catalytic core. Splicing factors belonging to the DExD/DExH-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases {{are thought to have}} a central role in directing these rearrangements by unwinding RNA helices. Proof of this hypothesis has, however, been conspicuously lacking. Results: Prp 16 is a DEAH-box protein that functions in the second step of splicing in vitro. Using various <b>RNA</b> <b>duplexes</b> as substrate, we have shown that Prp 16 has an ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. This activity is independent of sequence in either the single-stranded or duplexed regions of the RNA substrate. A mutation (prp 16 - 1) near the ATP-binding motif of Prp 16 inhibits both the RNA-dependent ATPase activity and the ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. Conclusions: Our findings provide strong biochemical evidence that Prp 16 can disrupt a <b>duplexed</b> <b>RNA</b> structure on the spliceosome. Because the purified protein lacks sequence specificity in unwinding <b>RNA</b> <b>duplexes,</b> targeting of the unwinding activity of Prp 16 in the spliceosome is likely to be determined by other interacting protein factors.

These experiments have been guided in part by experimental reconstructions of ancestral RNases from extinct organisms that were intermediates {{in the evolution of}} the RNase superfamily. It is shown that the enhanced interactions between bovine seminal RNase and double-stranded nucleic acid do not arise from the increased number of basic residues carried by the seminal enzyme.
