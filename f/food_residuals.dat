5000|$|The {{roots of}} San Francisco’s {{recycling}} and composting {{program can be}} traced back to the formation of the Scavengers Protective Union in 1879, when loose federations of scavengers began. Most were Italian immigrants from one region of Italy and they hauled municipal waste in horse-drawn wagons and hand separated valuable discards for resale. [...] The scavengers made a living from materials similar to those salvaged in recycling programs today such as wood, metals, glass, rags, yard trimmings and <b>food</b> <b>residuals.</b> At that time, some of the materials were used as fuel, others were recycled and the yard debris and <b>food</b> <b>residuals</b> were sold to hog farmers in the outlying neighborhoods of the City for use as animal feed.|$|E

[...] This program was fully operational by 1991, and contributed to San Francisco's achievement of 27 percent diversion in 1990. By 1997, the program had led to an additional 15,500 tons of recyclables diverted, yet, a 1996 waste characterization study illustrated additional opportunities for reaching AB939 goals. According to the study, 60,000 tons of unrecovered recyclables remained in the waste stream, 26 percent of which were <b>food</b> <b>residuals.</b> Because San Francisco is a dense city, yard waste was found to make up only 5 percent of the residential waste stream. These findings, in conjunction with AB939 diversion requirements, prompted San Francisco to develop new curbside recycling pilots that included the collection of <b>food</b> <b>residuals.</b>|$|E

Restaurant waste (RW) is the leftover which {{can no longer}} be used in restaurants and hotels. Since it has high nutritional value and low price, RW can be considered as a valuable feedstuff for animal nutrition (Kojima 2005). Soliman et al. (1978) studied nutritional value of RW. They reported the values of 7.5, 21.6, 16.6, 4.6, 31.6, 18.3, 5.2 and 1.4 percent for moisture, crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), nitrogen free extract (NFE), ash, calcium and phosphorus content of RW, respectively. Furthermore, Moradi (2012) calculated dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ash, CP, EE, CF and metabolizable energy (ME) of RW as following: 33.4, 95.9, 4.1, 15.1, 14.1, 12.3 percent and 3, 270  kcal/kg, respectively. However, RW usage encountered some serious limitations because of its high potential to decay. Heat processing is one of the effective ways of reducing microbial contamination of feed. Sancho et al. (2004) suggested that <b>food</b> <b>residual</b> thermally processed at 65  °C for 20  min could be used as animal feed. However, due to high cost of heat processing, alternative methods can be considered.|$|R

40|$|Managing the water-energy-nutrient nexus for {{the built}} {{environment}} requires, in part, a full system analysis of energy consumption, global warming and eutrophication potentials of municipal water services. As an example, we evaluated the life cycle energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and aqueous nutrient releases of the whole anthropogenic municipal water cycle starting from raw water extraction to wastewater treatment and reuse/discharge for five municipal water and wastewater systems. The assessed options included conventional centralized services and four alternative options following the principles of source-separation and water fit-for-purpose. The comparative life cycle assessment identified that centralized drinking water supply coupled with blackwater energy recovery and on-site greywater treatment and reuse was the most energy- and carbon-efficient water service system evaluated, while the conventional (drinking water and sewerage) centralized system ranked as the most energy- and carbon-intensive system. The electricity generated from blackwater and <b>food</b> <b>residuals</b> co-digestion was estimated to offset at least 40 % of life cycle energy consumption for water/waste services. The dry composting toilet option demonstrated the lowest life cycle eutrophication potential. The nutrients in wastewater effluent are the dominating contributors for the eutrophication potential for the assessed system configurations. Among the parameters for which variability and sensitivity were evaluated, the carbon intensity of the local electricity grid and the efficiency of electricity production by the co-digestion with the energy recovery process {{were the most important}} for determining the relative global warming potential results...|$|E
40|$|Fats, oil {{and grease}} (FOG) can be {{recovered}} efficiently from grease interceptors for biodiesel production. FOG is susceptible to hydrolysis because of its inherent high moisture content {{and the presence of}} lipases associated with <b>food</b> <b>residuals</b> in the grease interceptors. This study reveals that the FFA content of FOG derived from grease interceptors did not exceed 8 % (w/w) due to constant influx of fresh FOG from wastewater. However, if the FOG is allowed to hydrolyze without dilution, the FFA content can reach 15 % (w/w) in more than 20 Â days. Experiments were conducted to optimize reaction parameters for the esterification of FOG prior to the conventional alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process. Sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) was a more efficient catalyst than Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 in reducing the acid value to [less-than-or-equals, slant] 1 Â mg KOH/g under identical reaction conditions. At reaction temperatures of [less-than-or-equals, slant] 50 Â Â°C, only H 2 SO 4 was capable of reaching the recommended acid value within 24 Â h. The optimum methanol to FFA ratio for an H 2 SO 4 -catalyzed reaction was 20 : 1, whereas for Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 it was above 26 : 1.

40|$|Agricultural {{multifunctionality}} is {{the recognition}} of the joint exercise of economic, environmental and social functions by this sector. In order to make this concept operative for the design of public policies, it is necessary to estimate the social demand for such functions. The main objective {{of this article is to}} present an empirical application in this line. For this purpose we have taken the agricultural system of mountain olive groves in Andalusia (Southern Spain) at risk of abandonment after the decoupling of the EU subsidies as a case study. The economic valuation technique used is the Choice Experiment. According to the results, there is a different contribution of each attribute to the improvement of the Society level of utility. The main finding of this study is the identification of a social demand for public goods and services provided by the mountains olive groves. This support for agricultural multifunctionality is heterogeneous in its perception by the citizens and the valuation of the various attributes that the concept involves. Taking into account the impact of an overall improvement in the attribute levels and the socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents, the results suggest that women, people with higher education levels, urban citizens and families with more than three members are those who benefit most from the provision of public goods by agriculture. There is a different contribution of each attribute to the improvement of the Society level of utility. Thus, and taking into account its WTP for each attribute, keeping rural population in their villages and fighting soil erosion (with 22. 61 and 21. 55 /individual/year, respectively) seem to be the most valued functions of the mountain olive groves by Andalusian citizens. It follows the improvement of the visual quality of the rural landscapes (12. 20 /individual/year) and the reduction of <b>food</b> <b>residuals</b> (7. 14 /individual/year). Finally, the results of this study support the new orientation of the CAP which makes decoupled payments on compliance with a range of environmental, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards, as a result of which, the cross-compliance requirement of the EU agricultural support will, presumably, promote a net increase in social welfare. Yet, according to the results of this research, some efforts should be done to allow cross-compliance to reinforce the objectives of keeping rural population in rural areas and the improvement of the landscape.

40|$|Increasing {{production}} of corn masa for tortillas, chips, and related snack foods is resulting {{in large quantities}} of organic residuals requiring environmentally-sound management strategies. This study focused on developing value-added livestock feed from these processing byproducts. First, a complete physical and nutritional analysis was conducted. Laboratory-scale and pilot-scale extrusion trials were then performed. Finally, to assess the actual viability of a livestock feed material, an economic model was developed. Through a series of simulation runs with this model, {{it was determined that}} direct shipping was by far the most inexpensive means of recycling masa processing residuals as feed ingredients (10 to 57 $/Mg). Blending prior to shipping resulted in increased costs (3 to 15 times greater). Extrusion and pellet mill processing were considerably more expensive than direct shipping (5 to 18 times, and 4 to 18 times greater, respectively), while dehydration was clearly cost prohibitive (33 to 81 times greater). Based on this cost analysis, it is recommended that direct shipping and feeding to livestock be implemented as the recycling option of choice for masa processing byproducts.

40|$|Responses {{in growth}} rate, food {{conversion}} efficiency, carcass composition, <b>residual</b> <b>food</b> intake, meat quality and reproduction traits to selection in pigs for four years, for {{high or low}} post-weaning growth rate on a fixed but restricted ration were measured in progeny grown on either restricted, ad libitum individual or ad libitum group feeding regimens. Genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits were also examined on animals whose full pedigrees comprised a total of 5324 animals. Substantial divergent response was achieved from selection for high vs. low growth rate on restricted feeding, with the genetic means of daily gain diverging by 81. 25 g or 2. 78 genetic standard deviations (SigmaG). The high and low growth rate lines also differed in ultrasonic backfat and food conversion efficiency by 1. 12 SigmaG and 0. 84 SigmaG, and by 0. 88 SigmaG, 1. 10 SigmaG, and 1. 14 SigmaG for carcass weight daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage, respectively. These responses {{were consistent with the}} moderately to highly, favourable genetic correlations among and between performance and carcass composition traits. Genetic changes in growth rate, ultrasonic backfat, food conversion ratio, carcass daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage when measured on ad libitum individual feeding were all economically beneficial. The high growth line had a significantly lower voluntary daily <b>food</b> intake and <b>residual</b> <b>food</b> intake than the contemporaneous low line, indicating a reduced energy requirement for maintenance in the high relative to the low line. Genetic correlations between either growth rate or backfat and carcass traits were favourable but unfavourable between daily food intake and carcass fat or lean percentage, implying that selection strategies which place emphasis on increased leanness and decreased fatness would result in a decline in voluntary food intake of the animals. The descendants of breeding pigs selected for high post-weaning daily gain on restricted feeding showed significantly increased growth rates, slaughter weights and carcase lean percentages and reduced fatness when grown in group housing with ad libitum feeding. This suggests that restricted feeding is an effective performance testing approach for seedstock lines supplying commercial regimens with group housing and ad libitum feeding. Carcase lean pH values measured 24 hours post-mortem (pH 24) were not statistically different between the selected lines, suggesting that an increase in basal metabolic rate due to increased rate of lean deposition in the high relative to the low line may have been compensated for by a reduction in heat production from other sources such as physical activity. Such a reduction was evidenced by a lower <b>residual</b> <b>food</b> intake in the high than the low growth lines. This supports the hypothesis that selection for high growth rate on restricted feeding does not have detrimental effects on pork quality. The sows of the high growth line produced more piglets with significantly heavier weights at birth, giving a potential for better post-natal growth and higher yield of pork weaned per sow per year than the low growth sows. Body weights of the high line sows prior to mating were also significantly higher than those of low line sows suggesting earlier age of sexual maturity. A non-significant tendency for high line sows to have a lower voluntary food intake than low line sows pointed to the possibility that their lower maintenance requirement as growers was carried over to the lactational phase of life. It is concluded that selection for high growth rate on a restricted ration of fixed amount will produce pig strains with a high genetic potential for lean growth, reduced energy requirement for maintenance and improved reproductive performance, and which will be suitable for growing under a wide range of commercial feeding environments...|$|R

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) {{are some of the}} most promising biodegradable biopolymers for a sustainable future (Philip et al. 2007). Poly-(R)- 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB), that is naturally produced by several bacterial species as an energy storage depot, typically under conditions of nitrogen starvation (Suriyamongkol et al. 2007; Madison and Huisman 1999), is one of the most studied PHAs. Numerous hosts have been suggested as PHA producers, such as natural PHB-producing bacterial species or engineered Escherichia coli. Nevertheless E. coli suffers from regular phage infections in industrial production settings (Lian et al. 2014), while the natural PHB-producing bacterial species are not well adapted to harsh environments, such as growth in SSL. Instead baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that is known for its tolerance to acidic and inhibitor-rich conditions, is considered one of the favored species for converting the sugars found in SSL into bulk chemicals of interest – e.g. PHB (Demeke et al. 2013). SSLs are commonly rich in xylose, a pentose sugar that is not naturally consumed by S. cerevisiae. Therefore, efficient xylose-metabolizing S. cerevisiae strains have been developed (Hahn-Hägerdal et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013).|$|R

One advantage is that this prepares both materials for convenient disposal by incineration. This study examines fry-drying of municipal sewage sludge using recycled cooking oil. The transport processes occurring during fry-drying were monitored through sample weight, temperature, and image analysis. Due to the thicker and wetter samples than the common fried <b>foods,</b> high <b>residual</b> moisture is observed in the sludge when the boiling front has reached the geometric center of the sample, suggesting that the operation is heat transfer controlled only {{during the first half}} of the process followed by the addition of other mechanisms that allow complete drying of the sample.

In order to study the effect of the operating conditions on the fry-drying kinetics, different oil temperatures (from 120 to 180 degrees C), diameter (D = 15 to 25 mm), and initial moisture content of the sample (4. 8 and 5. 6 kg water(.) kg(- 1) total dry solids) were investigated...|$|R
30|$|When food is {{masticated}} {{and mixed}} with saliva, salivary fluid is {{absorbed into the}} food, whereas moisture contained in the food is released into the mouth as the physical structure of the food is altered. Mastication make the <b>food</b> bolus. <b>Residual</b> liquid in the mouth subsequently facilitates the swallowing of <b>food.</b> The <b>residual</b> liquid, however, is also known to cause aspiration or asphyxia, depending on the amount released in elderly people with impaired masticatory and swallowing function and in infants for whom this function is still immature (Feinberg et al. 1996; Joan 2006). In rheological terms, bolus hardness rapidly decreased as the masticatory sequence progressed, by contrast, adhesiveness and cohesiveness regularly increased until the time of swallowing (Peyron et al. 2011). Foods with much water release are divided into bolus and water in mastication, and foods with much absorption of saliva in mastication make bolus of high adhesiveness, both are not good for elderly people or infants. There was a report that water content of cereal boluses collected just before swallowing was likely {{to depend on the}} person who ate the cereals and not depend on the type of the cereals eaten (Loret et al. 2011). Therefore, determining the level of water release or absorption in chewing food and predicting the difficulty in swallowing before each meal is clinically important. The hypothesis of this study was existence of methods of mechanically measurement for predicting water releasing or absorptive tendency during mastication. Conventional methods of determining the level of syneresis, water release, etc. of foods, including determining the surface and content of food include: (1) carefully placing food on filter paper or wiping food on filter paper (Umene et al. 2015), and (2) compressing food using a creep meter (Nohara et al. 2010). Another method of determining the water absorption of food is to immerse polished rice in water (Miwa et al. 2002). By using these conventional methods, however, measuring or predicting levels of water release from food and absorption of saliva into food in the mouth during food intake at the same time is not feasible. During mastication, movements of the tongue also contribute to bolus formation (Koshino et al. 1997), and maximum tongue pressure is reported to be approximately 40  kPa in normal individuals (Hayashi et al. 2002). Since conventional methods do not consider the influence of the tongue, properly predicting and understanding this influence on mastication and swallowing during food intake is difficult. For these reasons, we devised a new method to appropriately assess behaviors of water in the mouth during mastication and swallowing, including water release and absorption of foods, by classifying the characteristics of foods into the following three groups: (1) high water release, (2) intermediate, and (3) high water absorption, assuming (1) high water release and (3) high absorption foods are not suitable for people with dysphagia, while (2) intermediate foods are suitable.|$|R
30|$|Because {{arable land}} is limited, land use {{for food and}} {{bioenergy}} production remains a controversial issue. If food crops can generate high yields and the biomass {{can also be used}} effectively for both animal feed and bioenergy production feedstock, conflicts over land use can be reduced. Rice is an important crop; as a worldwide staple <b>food</b> with abundant <b>residuals</b> (polysaccharide-rich straw) after grain collection, this crop plant is attractive as a renewable raw material for bioenergy and feed production. Here, we address current issues and discuss promising methods for improving rice plant characteristics suitable for food, feed, and bioenergy production. Advanced genetic engineering techniques can be used to precisely manipulate the mechanisms regulating grain production, cellulose and lignin content, and stress tolerance. In addition, genetic modification of the mechanisms controlling glycoside hydrolase expression can enhance biomass saccharification for bioenergy production and improved animal digestibility. We also address the issue of nutrient recycling associated with rice straw utilisation for biofuel production.|$|R

In the semicontinuous cultivation, the microalga is maintained in better concentration of nutrients and the photoinhibition by excessive cell is reduced. Thus, biomass productivity and biocompounds of interest, such as lipid productivity, may be higher than in batch cultivation. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of blend concentration, medium renewal rate, and concentration of sodium bicarbonate on the growth of Chlorella sp. during semicontinuous cultivation.

40|$|Two Rhode Island Red {{egg-laying}} {{lines have}} been divergently selected on <b>residual</b> <b>food</b> intake (low intake R- line, high intake R+ line) for 19 generations. In addition to direct response, correlated responses have altered several other traits such as carcass adiposity and lipid contents of several tissues, the R+ animals being leaner than the R- ones. In {{a search for the}} biological origin of the differences observed in fat deposit, the hepatic mRNA amounts of genes involved in lipid metabolism were investigated. No difference was found between lines for mRNA levels of ATP citrate-lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, a transcription factor acting on several lipogenesis genes. The genes coding for stearoyl-CoA desaturase and apolipoprotein A 1 displayed significantly lower mRNA levels in the R+ cockerels compared to the R-. All together these mRNA levels explained 40 % of the overall variability of abdominal adipose tissue weight, suggesting an important role of both genes in the fatness variability...|$|R
