5|$|The Indonesian {{sociologist}} Umar Kayam, who {{had served}} on the Jakarta Art Council with Djajakusuma, described the director as highly disciplined. Biran described him as having a fiery temper which could be triggered suddenly, yet quick to calm when the trigger was removed; this sentiment was echoed by several people {{who had worked with}} Djajakusuma.

5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} had to prove <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they {{are thought to be}} powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E
5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to be placed on the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected {{as one of the}} original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first manned Project Mercury flight, MR-3, in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7. <b>His</b> <b>craft</b> entered space, but did not achieve orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first person to manually control the orientation of his spacecraft. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B Freedom 7 II in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was cancelled.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning <b>his</b> <b>craft,</b> Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{childhood}} in London {{was one of}} poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, {{he was sent to}} a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, {{he was one of the}} best-known figures in the world.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely learned <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> in {{his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E

5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of <b>his</b> <b>craft.</b> Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|His {{family had}} no {{theatrical}} connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided {{that his son}} should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned <b>his</b> <b>craft</b> in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, {{and by the end}} of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1964) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970).|$|E
50|$|Day’s earlier works {{tended to}} follow the fashionable Grecian Style, which {{combined}} German, French, and English versions of the Greek Revival style to create a design trend wholly American {{in the way that}} it took popular styles and combined and elaborated on them. Day’s Grecian Style pieces involved intricate moldings and often took pieces common to other types of furniture, such as placing wardrobe-style cornices on a bookshelf. Also demonstrated in Day’s pieces under this style are <b>his</b> unique <b>craft</b> methods to create pieces of quality efficiently. For example, to create the illusion of multiple single glass panes in the doors on his bookshelves, Day would place one long, horizontal pane of glass behind singular frames. Day also employed dovetail and mortise-and-tenon joint techniques in <b>his</b> <b>crafting.</b>|$|R
