40|$|This study {{examines}} the diversifying, hedging and safe haven properties of gold bullion, gold stocks, gold {{mutual funds and}} gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US. The methodology of this study involves three different econometric models. The first model assumes that the gold price is dependent on changes {{in the stock market}} and that this relation is influenced by specific, extreme, market conditions. The second model assumes that the gold asset-stock relation changes with uncertainty of the market. The third model analyses several predefined periods of financial crises. The results of the first model show empirical support in favour of gold bullion as a strong hedge. In contrast, gold stocks, mutual funds and ETFs tend to be diversifiers. The safe haven properties are shown to be limited to gold bullion, however, some individual <b>gold</b> <b>assets</b> do exhibit such properties. The results of the second model present a greater incidence of safe haven properties for each of the <b>gold</b> <b>assets</b> in response to volatility. The results also suggest that there is a greater incidence of safe haven properties in response to US volatility as opposed to World volatility. Finally, the third model identifies a number of different assets that do exhibit safe haven qualities in pre-defined periods of financial crises...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the return of {{investment}} in <b>gold</b> <b>assets</b> quoted at the Paris stock exchange during 54 years, from 1950 to 2003. Contrarily to what is thought about this mythical metal, its risk-return is very inferior to other financial assets (stocks and bonds). While it has {{a high degree of}} risk, its return is less than that of the risk-free asset. Moreover for individual investors, investment in gold has given a very low result in real terms. A capital of 100 new francs invested in the gold coin napoleon in December 1949 would have been liquidated for 56 new francs in December 2003. So its real rate of return was - 1 % per year.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{exposure}} of the stock prices of Australian gold-mining firms to changes in gold prices and the valuation effects of gold price exposure. Goldmining firms have significant gold price exposure; {{the price of the}} average goldmining stock moves 0. 76 % for each 1. 00 % change in Australian-dollar-denominated gold prices. Evidence from the behaviour of stock price sensitivities suggests that gold-mining firms can be represented as a portfolio of <b>gold</b> <b>assets</b> and embedded real options. Simple discounted cash flow models systematically underestimate the price of gold stocks. The evidence suggests that the valuation error is due to both the failure of discounted cash flow models to reflect managerial flexibility that is embedded in the operation of gold mines and the misuse of discounted cash flow techniques.

40|$|This paper aims to {{determine}} the impact Regulation 28 has on optimal asset allocation. The revised Regulation 28 of the pensions fund act came into effect as of 1 July 2011 which imposed certain restrictions or constraints on pension funds under direct control of trustees. This study evaluates some of the constraints imposed on the Regulation 28 {{through the use of}} Markowitz (1952) efficient frontier framework and a non-parametric model. With offshore allocation increased to 25 % and an additional 5 % to African (ex SA) markets the study also explores the diversification prospects to international, emerging and African (exSA) markets. The findings suggest that international markets bring about increase benefits to South African markets; however, when the Regulation 28 constraint is imposed the benefits slightly diminishes. Further analysis show that emerging and African markets bring little to no benefits to optimal South African pension fund allocation. Locally, the study looked at the gold index and the findings suggest that the <b>gold</b> <b>asset</b> class increases the welfare of an investor and it's a safe haven asset class...|$|R
