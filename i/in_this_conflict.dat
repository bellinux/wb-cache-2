5|$|At the {{beginning}} of September, Lent's squadron, 7./JG132, relocated to Großenhain near Dresden, in preparation {{and support of the}} annexation of Czechoslovakia. Lent flew a number of operational patrols <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> until his Staffel relocated again to Rangsdorf on 29 September 1938. After the tension over the occupation of the Sudeten territories eased, Lent's unit began a conversion to the Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun. On 1 November 1938 III./JG132 moved to Fürstenwalde, between Berlin and Frankfurt an der Oder, and was renamed II./JG141, and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron.|$|E

Jagdgruppe 88 in Spain in April 1938. The Staffel, commanded by Werner Mölders, took part in the Spanish Civil War where Oesau claimed nine victories, flying 130 combat missions. For this he received the Spanish Cross (Spanienkreuz) in Gold with Diamonds. He was also wounded <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> which earned him the Spanish Wound Badge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] An {{important}} design {{issue in}} {{distributed data processing}} systems is to determine optimal data distribution. The problem requires a tradeoff between time and cost. For instance, quick response time conflicts with low cost. The paper addresses the data distribution problem <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflicting</b> environment. A formulation of the problem as a non-linear program is developed. An algorithm employing a simple search procedure is presented, which gives an optimal data distribution. An example is solved to illustrate the method...|$|R
50|$|In 1932, the South West African {{government}} was waging war against Iipumbu, king of Uukwambi, {{and in the}} end forced him into exile <b>in</b> Kavango. <b>This</b> <b>conflict</b> had the effect that the number of patients at Onandjokwe decreased considerably.|$|R
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict,</b> had been {{on opposite sides of}} the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia {{remained}} independent {{until they were}} conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor. The Lydian king Alyattes II attacked Miletus, a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia, that meant that Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs. At this time, the Lydians were also {{in conflict with the}} Median Empire, and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict.</b> Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians, with the Halys River set up as the border between the kingdoms. The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father Alyattes in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His involvement <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict,</b> which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to be taken up again.|$|E
50|$|In 1710 the Mascate War {{took place}} <b>in</b> Pernambuco. <b>This</b> <b>conflict</b> set the mascates (traveling salesman) from Recife against the {{establishment}} hosted in Olinda {{and led by}} the Senhores de Engenho (owners of the sugar mills, literally: sugar mill lords).|$|R

50|$|He {{was known}} as a left-winger, and gained {{prominence}} for his attacks on Margaret Thatcher's handling of the Falklands War in 1982, although it was <b>in</b> fact <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> which saw support for the Conservative government increase, and contribute to its re-election the following year.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
5|$|Tensions in Europe {{had been}} {{steadily}} mounting since the French Revolution of 1789 and in 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began with {{war between the}} new French Republic and the Austrian and Prussian Empires. Great Britain was not initially engaged <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict,</b> but diplomatic relations with France were rapidly deteriorating. On 1 February 1793, shortly after {{the execution of the}} deposed King Louis XVI, the French National Convention declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. Due to the long distances involved, it took five months for news of the outbreak of war to reach India, passing through the British consul at Alexandria, George Baldwin. On 2 June the news arrived at Madras and passed to Calcutta on 11 June. The Governor-General of India Lord Cornwallis issued instructions for operations against the territories of French India. Lord Cornwallis, brother to William, originally intended to participate in the surrender of Pondicherry himself in the seized French merchant ship Bien Aimé, but was eventually dissuaded.|$|E
5|$|The Kalachuris were {{originally}} immigrants into the southern Deccan from central India and called themselves Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras. Bijjala II and his ancestors had governed as Chalukya commanders (Mahamandaleshwar) over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 provinces (overlapping region in present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada or Annigeri as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him Mahabhujabala Chakravarti ("emperor with powerful shoulders and arms") indicating {{he no longer}} was a subordinate of the Chalukyas. However the successors of Bijjala II were unable {{to hold on to}} Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV made a final bid to regain the empire by recapturing Kalyani. Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict.</b> During this time, Hoysala Veera Ballala II was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Someshvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris. The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> {{intelligence}} {{played an}} important role on both sides. Hannibal mastered an intelligence service that enabled him to achieve outstanding victories.

25|$|It {{was said}} {{to the public and}} press that workers {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> were guilty of outrageous conduct at the farm, which motivated accusations brought forth before the authorities whereby the police had to intervene in order to safeguard company assets.

25|$|One {{escalation}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>conflict</b> is the traffickers' {{use of new}} {{means to}} claim their territory and spread fear.
