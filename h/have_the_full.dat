5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E

25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to the inherently poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect for anything else) and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E

25|$|Kodiak bear {{research}} and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is {{managed by the}} ADF, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 – May 15, and fall: October 25 – November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to nonresidents). Nonresidents are required to hire a registered guide who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000–$22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak prior to going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF wildlife biologist {{before it can be}} taken from the islands. Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the official stamp. Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF officers who often <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island's environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island's remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.|$|E

500|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two Quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems as though this was the first instance of a joint Patricio-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly, there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the leges Valeriae Horatiae), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians. This gave the Plebeian Tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person (intercessio) to veto acts of the senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> force of law, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the [...] "Hortensian Law"), which removed the last check that the Patricians in the senate had over this power.|$|E

500|$|Dorsal {{scales are}} oblique, smooth and narrow.

Most individuals over [...] in total length <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> adult coloration, but even some adults may return to a darker bluish green just before shedding.

[...] Hutchinson, unlike Oliver, made no specific proposals on how the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, [...] "I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event." [...] Oliver's letters, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members where then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.|$|E
500|$|In 494 BC, {{the city}} was at war with two {{neighboring}} tribes. The plebeian soldiers refused to march against the enemy, and instead seceded to the Aventine Hill. The plebeians demanded the right to elect their own officials. The patricians agreed, and the plebeians returned to the battlefield. The plebeians called these new officials [...] "plebeian tribunes". The tribunes would have two assistants, called [...] "plebeian aediles". During the 5th century BC, a series of reforms were passed. The result of these reforms was that any law passed by the plebeian would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> force of law. In 443 BC, the censorship was created.
