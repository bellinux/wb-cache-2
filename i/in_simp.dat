40|$|Topology {{optimization}} {{of structures}} sometimes gives designs that cannot be economically manufactured without post-processing. Because post-processing of topology solutions {{might lead to}} suboptimal designs, {{it is useful to}} include manufacturing constraints at the outset. In this work, we present a method for the topology optimization of micromachined devices by including surface micromachining constraints. Instead of explicitly including manufacturing constraints, we propose a novel design parameterization that implicitly restricts the design space so that it consists of only the manufacturable designs for a chosen surface-micromachining foundry process. In surface-micromachining, the photolithographic masks determine the geometry of surface-micromachined structures. Therefore, we use the masks themselves as the design variables in topology optimization. By using the continuous mask opacities as the design variables, we developed a virtual material movement model (VMMM) in which the material from a layer deposited on top of a putatively porous layer will move down. Consequently, the virtual density of material in the design domain changes depending on the opacity values of the masks in different cells. This virtual density is similar to the fictitious density assumed in Simple Isotropic Material with Penalty (SIMP) and other material interpolation techniques. The difference is that the opacity values of the masks are design variables here whereas the densities of the cells themselves are design variables <b>in</b> <b>SIMP.</b> In this manner, surface-micromachining constraints are implicitly satisfied in this desig...|$|E

40|$|Topology {{optimization}} {{has been}} developed more than 20 years. This method has beenwidely used in traditional structural design as well as design of compliant mechanisms usedfor MEMS structures. The apparent advantage of using topology optimization is to avoid abad initial design made by inexperienced designers. Topology optimization can generate astructure for final use or as an initial design for further improvement. Usually, the resultobtained by topology optimization {{can not be used}} directly because the current method usedto generate the topology can not produce smooth boundaries that can be manufactured easily. Besides this, some uncertain elements and patterns may appear in the topology, and thereforesome post-processing treatments must be done to make it usable. Although this method hasbeen used for many years, the aforementioned drawbacks still need to be solved. The mainissues are: the existence of uncertain elements(grey elements), the zigzag pattern and thecheckerboard pattern structures. Some researchers have studied these problems and providedsome solutions. These solutions more or less solve the problems. However, they are veryhard to be implemented with commercialized finite element codes. Therefore, this projectwill propose some new ideas {{to reduce the number of}} grey elements as well as the zigzagpatterns. These new approaches can be easily incorporated with commercialized finiteelement codes so that they can be used to solve practical design problems. The main aims ofthis proposal are to reduce or eliminate the grey elements as well as the zigzag patternstructures. In the meantime, the checkerboard patterns may hopefully be reduced by thesetwo efforts simultaneously. This research project will be conducted in two years. The first year will concentrate ondeveloping some new penalty function which can penalize and also encourage the designvariables toward 0 or 1. It is different from the widely used SIMP method. <b>In</b> <b>SIMP,</b> alldesign variables are penalized. However, our approach only penalizes those design variableswith smaller values and force them to approach 0 but encourages those design variables withlarger values toward 1. Through this effort, most design variable will be expected to be 0 or 1. In this year, an interface program will also be developed to incorporated msc. nastran with thetopology optimizer. The aim of the 2 nd year is to eliminate the zigzag pattern structures. The basic idea is tocreate specific finite element meshes for different design needs. In order fulfill this aim andalso reduce the computational cost, Taguchi's method for experiments will be employed sothat only a minimum number of analyses are needed to determine the idea orientation ofmeshes and the type of elements used in the given design space. The zigzag pattern isexpected to be reduced through using proper meshes and elements. A simple post-processingprocedure will also be developed to fix or eliminate those still existing zigzag patterns. Through these efforts, the result of topology optimization may be used directly. 結構拓樸最佳化(Topology optimization) 方法發展至今已有二十年歷史，這個方法已被廣泛使用在傳統的結構設計上，也被應用在微機電的撓性機構(Compliant mechanism) 設計上。拓樸最佳化的最大好處是排除了設計者的經驗不足可能造成的不良影響，它直接使用最佳化方法去得到一個最終設計，或是一個理想的初始設計以待進一步的改進。通常拓樸最佳化的結果並不能直接被使用，原因是目前所使用的方法除了無法產生出一個具有平滑外型且易於製造的結構外，同時結構內部也經常存在一些不確定的構件以及不合理的拓樸形狀，必須使用一定的後處理程序才可將結果實用化。縱然拓樸最佳化方法已被成功地應用在許多結構設計上，但是它仍然有上述的問題有待改善；綜合這些問題大致可分成三類，一是灰階元素(Grey element) 的存在，二是鋸齒狀拓樸形狀的產生，三是棋盤式結構(Checkerboard pattern) 的產生。雖然已有許多文獻探討和嘗試改善這些問題，並且也得到一些成果。但是要將這些方法和商品化的有限元素分析軟體結合，以便應用到實際結構設計上會有很大的困難，因此本計畫將提出一些新的方法去減少灰階元素和鋸齒狀結構的產生，這些方法都很容易和商品化的有限元素軟體結合，所以可直接應用在真實結構的拓樸最佳化設計上。本計畫所提出的方法主要是以消除灰階元素和減少鋸齒狀結構的形成為主要目的，但是在達成這兩個目的的同時，預期棋盤式的結構也可能同時被消滅或減少。本計畫將分成兩年執行，第一年將發展出新的設計變數懲罰和獎勵並用的方法，這個方法將有別於目前被廣泛使用的SIMP 法。SIMP 法是對所有設計變數都進行懲罰，而本計畫的方法是迫使小的設計變數趨近於 0 ，獎勵大的設計變數趨近於 1 ，而達成消滅或減少灰階元素的目的。第一年中也將同時完成結合msc. nastran 有限元素分析軟體的介面程式之撰寫。第二年的主要目標是消除鋸齒狀的拓樸結構，同時亦將使用第一年的研究成果來進行拓樸最佳化，研究的基本構想是針對不同的需求建構最適當的有限元素網格。為了達成此一目的，將使用田口實驗設計方法在最少的分析次數下，找出針對各個不同的設計需求，在指定的設計空間中、特定的受力和邊界條件下較理想的有限元素網格的建立方式和使用元素的種類，以期能經由適當的網格佈建和搭配適當的元素，來降低鋸齒狀拓樸結構的產生；同時亦將發展簡單的後處理技術去修補或去除仍然可能存在的少量鋸齒狀結構，以便能達成直接使用拓樸最佳化結果之理想境界...|$|E

Using baited remote underwater video (BRUV), fish assemblages were surveyed at 56 sites spread across shallow, intermediate, and deep reefs within the SIMP to examine spatial variation between depth categories. Relationships between assemblage patterns, depth, and four additional factors considered likely to affect assemblage patterns (distance from shore, reef type, dominant benthos, and latitude), were subsequently explored using multivariate statistical methods. Reef fish assemblages differed significantly among the depth categories. Assemblage patterns for fish were strongly correlated with depth and moderately correlated with the dominant benthic assemblage. Correlations with the other factors were generally weak. Three distinct assemblages occurred on reefsm, 25 – 50 [*]m and 3 ̆e 50 [*]m. Shallow (m) reefs also displayed strong cross-shelf patterns, supporting the results from other studies.

40|$|Phytoplankton {{abundance}} and distribution {{along the east}} coast of Australia are driven primarily by the southward flowing East Australian Current (EAC), which transports tropical water masses to temperate latitudes. The Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP, ~ 30 °S) is located north of the EAC separation point (~ 32 °S) in this tropical-temperate transition zone. In this study, we describe the oceanographic context (wind, current and nutrient load) during a wind-driven downwelling and a current-driven upwelling event, both sampled in austral winter only ten days apart. We investigate the effect of these contrasting oceanographic conditions on phytoplankton abundance, composition and distribution along a cross-shelf transect. During downwelling we find a cross-shelf transition in microphytoplankton composition from an offshore- to an inshore-community associated with nutrient gradients (nitrate and silicate). Strong vertical mixing leads to increased occurrences of benthic diatoms in near-shore surface waters. During upwelling conditions, elevated nutrient availability results in maximum microphytoplankton abundances (mainly oceanic diatoms) and increased species richness on the mid-shelf. An increase in dinoflagellates and silicoflagellates (mid-shelf) and the appearance of tropical phytoplankton (especially picoplankton and dinoflagellates, offshore) signals a strong impact of the EAC across all shelf communities. Nanoplankton are {{a major part of the}} winter phytoplankton community during both oceanographic regimes (~ 40 - 50 % of TChl a).

In recent years there has been increased attention on the adequacy of SIA process applied in major project assessment. Most applications have focused on the impact identification process with little attempt to give the community negotiating power over how impacts will be addressed. The impact assessment tends to occur at a single point in time, with no subsequent re-evaluation or ongoing social impact management and monitoring process. The assessments rarely specify how responsibilities for impacts on communities may be apportioned between project proponents and government, and have been inadequate in dealing with cumulative project impacts. In Queensland, concern about these shortfalls have led to the release of the Sustainable Resource Communities Policy 2008 and requirements for social impact management plans (SIMP) to be developed for each resource development in the State. In this paper a ‘pressure-state-response’ approach to impact assessment is used to develop an ‘impact-response-monitoring-evaluation’ (IRME) framework that can be applied to ongoing evaluation and monitoring of social impacts. The framework is applied to coal resource developments in the northern Bowen Basin in Queensland to identify core requirements <b>in</b> a <b>SIMP.</b> The IRME framework is flexible enough to be implemented at various spatial and time scales, for the wellbeing of the local and regional mining and non-mining communities in Australia. The framework can be further examined in other mine developments and could be integrated with the existing mining or environmental protection acts...|$|R
40|$|In density-based {{topology}} optimization, 0 / 1 {{solutions are}} sought. Discrete topological problems are often relaxed with continuous design variables {{so that they}} can be solved using continuous mathematical programming. Although the relaxed methods are practical, grey areas appear in the optimum topologies. SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) employs penalty schemes to suppress the intermediate densities. SRV (the Sum of the Reciprocal Variables) drives the solution to a 0 / 1 layout with the SRV constraint. However, both methods cannot effectively remove all the grey areas. SRV has some numerical aspects. In this work, a new scheme SIMP-SRV is proposed by combining SIMP and SRV approaches, where SIMP is employed to generate an intermediate solution to initialize the design variables and SRV is then adopted to produce the final design. The new method turned out to be very effective in conjunction with the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) when using for the stiffness topology optimization of continuum structures for minimum compliance. The numerical examples show that the hybrid technique can effectively remove all grey areas and generate stiffer optimal designs characterized with a sharper boundary <b>in</b> contrast to <b>SIMP</b> and SRV...|$|R

40|$|Limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} bleaching susceptibility of coral species that dominate high latitude reefs along the eastern seaboard of Australia. The main aims of this study were to: (i) monitor coral health and spatial patterns of coral bleaching response at the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP) and Lord Howe Island Marine Park (LHIMP), to determine variability of bleaching susceptibility among coral taxa; (ii) predict coral bleaching thresholds at 30 °S and 31. 5 °S, extrapolated from published bleaching threshold data; and (iii) propose a subtropical northern New South Wales coral bleaching model from biological and physical data. Between 2005 and 2007 minor bleaching was observed in dominant coral families including Pocilloporidae, Poritidae and Dendrophylliidae <b>in</b> the <b>SIMP</b> and Pocilloporidae, Poritidae and Acroporidae (Isopora and Montipora spp.) in the LHIMP, with a clear difference in bleaching susceptibility found between sites, both within and between locations. Bleaching susceptibility was highest in Porites spp. at the most offshore island site within the SIMP during summer 2005. Patterns of subtropical family bleaching susceptibility within the SIMP and LHIMP differed to those previously reported for the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). These differences may be due to a number of factors, including temperature history and/or the coral hosts association with different zooxanthellae clades, which may have lower thermal tolerances. An analysis of published estimates of coral bleaching thresholds from the Caribbean, South Africa, GBR and central and northern Pacific regions suggests that the bleaching threshold at 30 – 31. 5 °S ranges between 26. 5 – 26. 8 °C. This predicted threshold was confirmed by an extensive coral bleaching event on the world’s southernmost coral reef at Lord Howe Island, during the 2010 austral summer season. These results imply that dominant coral taxa at subtropical reefs along the eastern Australian seaboard are highly susceptible to thermal stress; which, in turn, could lead to a future decline in total live coral cover if predicted rising seawater temperatures lead to more frequent coral bleaching events in future...|$|R
40|$|Unconsolidated sediments form {{extensive}} seafloor habitats worldwide, yet {{few studies}} have examined fish assemblage patterns in relation to specific sediment type or morphology. Baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) were deployed at 3 sites (3 replicates per site) in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (<b>SIMP),</b> <b>in</b> each of 4 apparent ‘habitat types’ identified from swath acoustic mapping backscatter imagery and bathymetry. Habitat types ranged in reflected signal backscatter intensity: very dark, dark, light, very light. Additionally, apparent morphological features were associated with each (e. g. very dark = lens-shaped; light = sand waves). Sediments were characterised at each site by conducting granulometric analyses of samples collected using a van Veen grab. Both the darker ‘habitat types’ were found to be gravels and both lighter types were fine sands. There was a strong pattern in fish assemblage structure in relation to habitat type, and distinct assemblages were seen between ‘gravel’ and ‘fine sand’ habitats. Species richness was higher in gravel than in sand habitats. Additionally, 6 species were only recorded in the very dark lens habitat. However, there were no apparent differences in assemblage patterns between the 2 fine sand habitats. Of the different granulometric measures, fish assemblages were most strongly correlated with a combination of median grain size, % gravel and arithmetic sorting. The current habitat classification system for the SIMP includes habitat type (unconsolidated or hard substrata) as criteria for conservation planning. Further division of unconsolidated habitats into ‘gravel’ and ‘fine sand’ categories is needed to better represent biotic assemblages...|$|R

This potential has leaded the increasing activities of fishing, industrial, and dense residential in Wedung. Those activities {{were thought to}} be one of the sources of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr) accumulated <b>in</b> the <b>simping.</b> This study was aimed to determine the concentration of Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr in the A. pleuronectes, in the water and the sediment. Moreover, this study was also aimed to investigate the maximum weekly consumption A. pleuronectes which contained Pb, Cu, Cd, and Cr in Wedung waters area, Demak. The study was conducted in October-November 2011. The method used in this study was a study case method, while the purposive sampling method was used to determine the sampling locations. Sampling was conducted once every two week, with three repetitions. AAS (Atomic Absorbtion spectrophotometry), were used to analyze the heavy metal concentration, while the consumption of security analysis was used to analyze the MTI (Maximum Tolerable Intake). The range of the analysis results of Pb concentration in the scallop 2 ̆ 7 s shells were 33, 1362 – 35, 0762 ppm, and 11, 1272 – 13, 0852 ppm in the sediments, while the concentration in the soft tissues and water, were not detected. The Cu concentration in the soft tissue were ranged from 8, 9849 – 9, 4659 ppm, where in the scallop 2 ̆ 7 s shells were 11, 9836 – 12, 2358 ppm, water were 0, 07 – 0, 14 ppm, and in the sediments were 13, 0624 – 17, 6040 ppm. The Cd concentration in soft tissue were ranged from 5, 9212 – 8, 0136 ppm, scallop 2 ̆ 7 s shell were 2, 6195 – 5, 0125 ppm, and water were 0, 01 ppm at 2 nd and 3 rd samplings, while at the first sampling was not detected, whereas in the sediments the concentration ranged from 0, 4694 – 0, 7257 ppm.

40|$|AbstractThe {{release of}} proapoptotic {{proteins}} from the intermembrane space of mitochondria {{is an early}} critical step in many pathways to apoptosis. Induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) was suggested to be the mechanism of the release of soluble mitochondrial intermembrane proteins (<b>SIMP)</b> <b>in</b> apoptosis. However, several studies suggested that proapoptotic proteins (e. g. Bax and Bid) can induce the release of SIMP (e. g. cytochrome c (cyt c) and adenylate kinase 2 (AK 2)) in vivo and in vitro independent of PTP. We have found {{that a number of}} structurally diverse polycations, such as aliphatic polyamines (e. g. spermine {{and to a lesser extent}} spermidine), aminoglycosides (e. g. streptomycin, gentamicin and neomycin), and cytotoxic peptides (e. g. melittin), induce the release of SIMP from liver mitochondria, in vitro. All the polycations released AK 2 together with cyt c, suggesting that rupture of the outer membrane is a common mechanism of cyt c release by these polycations. Several polycations (e. g. spermine, spermidine and neomycin) induced SIMP release without inducing significant swelling, and this release was not inhibited significantly by the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin. In contrast, under the same conditions, streptomycin and melittin induced swelling and SIMP release that was inhibited strongly by cyclosporin. Gentamicin-induced swelling and release of SIMP were partially inhibited by cyclosporin. The affinity of polyamines to the anionic phospholipids of the mitochondrial membranes (spermine=neomycin>gentamicin>streptomycin=spermidine) correlated roughly with their ability to induce PTP-independent release of SIMP, which suggests that the binding of polycations to the anionic phospholipids of the outer mitochondrial membrane facilitates the rupture of this membrane. However, some polycations facilitated the induction of PTP, possibly by binding to cardiolipin on the inner membrane. This dual mechanism may be relevant to the induction of <b>SIMP</b> release <b>in</b> apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identified}} the core knowledge gap {{of a lack}} of competitive theorizing of strategy implementation (<b>SIMP)</b> <b>in</b> the processual and resource-based views of strategy. This gap exists due to tactical perception and relative inattention to variety in strategy implementation process and related competitive implications. It is argued that strategy process and the RBV perspectives can provide complementary insights necessary to move towards competitive theorizing of strategy implementation. A grounded research is conducted to compare how strategy implementation patterns explain implementation success and how those patterns explain heterogeneity in resources management in different firm types – foreign and indigenous. Content analysis of the interview data revealed significant heterogeneity in the strategy implementation process patterns and achieved implementation success. These SIMP process patterns are categorised based on the approach towards strategy implementation as a strategic phenomenon, firm’s type, and thrust of implementation process. Important sources of variations in implementation success emerged in the Competitive and Tactical implementing patterns. Three resources management activities emerged from the data and revealed important distinctions for the heterogeneous implementing patterns. The Tactical implementing patterns showed preference of strategic actors for use of internally available resources and acquisition of ready-made resources. The Competitive implementing patterns showed a balanced approach towards resources management by pursuing optimization of resources. These resources management heterogeneities are shaped by the SIMP process pattern and revealed implementation process performance, action timing and resources optimization as the key sources of competitiveness from strategy implementation. The empirical findings refute the notion that the role of strategy implementation is only to complement as an operational process without much competitive gains. This empirically challenges the conventional conceptions of implementation to adopt and institutionalize strategy and extends to the contribution of SIMP for strategy refinements to gain competitive gains. These findings strongly support that competitive theorizing of strategy implementation is a worthwhile scholarly pursuit via using the complementary views of strategy. Future research should build on this agenda of competitive theorizing of strategy implementation using other firm types, research settings and more micro level analysis...|$|R
