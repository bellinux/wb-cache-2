Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible. Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar, a <b>home</b> <b>networking</b> system called HomeGroup, and performance improvements.|$|E
25|$|Cisco {{acquired}} {{a variety of}} companies to spin products and talent into the company. In 1995–1996 the company completed 11 acquisitions. Several acquisitions, such as Stratacom, were the biggest deals in the industry when they occurred. During the Internet boom in 1999, the company acquired Cerent Corporation, a start-up company located in Petaluma, California, for about US$7billion. It was the most expensive acquisition made by Cisco to that date, and only the acquisition of Scientific Atlanta has been larger. In 1999 Cisco also acquired stake for $1 Billion in KPMG Consulting to enable establishing Internet firm Metrius founded by Keyur Patel of Fuse. Several acquired companies have grown into $1Bn+ business units for Cisco, including LAN switching, Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) platform Webex and <b>home</b> <b>networking.</b> The latter came as result of Cisco acquiring Linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed Cisco Valet.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated <b>home</b> <b>networking</b> tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E

40|$|As {{more and}} more digital {{appliances}} populate our <b>homes,</b> <b>networking</b> them to form a home automation (HA) system not only becomes an option, but almost a necessity. While comfort, security, and energy efficiency can be provided by many existing systems, they all remain complex islands {{that are difficult to}} expand and customize. We propose Internet technology to remedy the situation and to become the future solution for HA. For this, we analyze the feasibility of today’s Internet technology with regard to traditional HA solutions. Furthermore, we present two case studies that substantiate the benefits of our proposal. As we will show, with IPv 6 and 6 LoWPAN, a single network serves the classical as well as emerging aspects of HA while concepts from the Web provide benefits for both, developers and users. ...|$|R
