500|$|Streep {{appeared}} with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in The House of the Spirits (1993), set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film {{was not well}} received by critics. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever". The following year, Streep featured in The River Wild, {{as the mother of}} children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone found her to be [...] "strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen".|$|E

500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> moving. There is a real, human {{yearning for}} mercy in it — Mariah’s true {{cry for help}} from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Opinion on Licence to Kill has {{not changed}} {{with the passing of}} time and the reviews are still mixed: though film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a positive 77% [...] "fresh" [...] rating from 52 reviews. Tom Hibbert of Empire gives the film only two of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Dalton... <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> hopeless". Hibbert concluded that [...] "he may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery." [...] In 2006, IGN ranked Licence to Kill fifteenth out of the then 21 Bond films, claiming it is [...] "too grim and had strayed too far from the Bond formula." [...] That same year, Benjamin Svetkey and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as second worst in the series, questioning Wayne Newton's cameo, and considering that [...] "not even Benicio Del Toro in an early role as a henchman is enough to pep up the action." [...] The magazine also listed Pam Bouvier seventh on their list of worst Bond girls, saying Carey Lowell [...] "fumbled this attempt at giving 007 a modern, independent counterpart by turning her into a nagging pest." ...|$|E

500|$|Marion Blute, in Contemporary Sociology, {{noted that}} it was rare for any book to be {{reviewed}} {{on the front page}} of the New York Times, or to receive [...] "the extremes of reaction" [...] seen for Sociobiology. She found that [...] "the clarity, breadth and richness of accurately rendered detail in this monograph <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> breath-taking." [...] However, she objected to the claim that the book covered the biological basis of all social behaviour, as it did not cover what she called the [...] "epigenetic disciplines", the effects of the environment on the embryonic and later development of the individual including learning (nurture, not just nature). She called the gap [...] "unfortunate" [...] and pointed out that [...] "the development problem" [...] and the functioning of the human brain were the frontiers of research. She observed, citing Dobzhansky, that [...] "an evolutionary minded sociology which really appreciated the significance of sociocultural transmission along nongenetic lines would likely see society and culture in a very different way". Despite Wilson's neglect of [...] "epigenetic" [...] and social sciences, she urged sociologists to read [...] "this exceptionally fine book", noting that despite its length it should have been twice as long. She looked forward to seeing sociology coming to terms with the neo-Darwinian synthesis, something that was already under way, which (she argued) would enrich social theory, a much better result than the alternative possibility, a renewed waste of time on the nature-versus-nurture debate.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Fiennes {{was cast}} as Gareth Mallory, a former {{lieutenant}} {{colonel in the}} British Army and now {{the chairman of the}} Intelligence and Security Committee, which gives him the authority to regulate MI6. At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of M. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a [...] "really interesting part which <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> fun". To play the returning character of Miss Moneypenny, Naomie Harris was cast. Harris' role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite ongoing speculation in the media that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny, this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production of the film, with Harris herself even {{going so far as to}} dismiss claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny, stating that [...] "Eve is not remotely office-bound". According to Harris, Eve [...] " [...] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior". Another character returning to the series was Q, played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play, and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying [...] "I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney. The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the film series, but elected not to as they felt Connery's presence would be seen as stunt casting and disengage audiences from the film.|$|E

[...] "I do work the shit out of my electronic equipment but there's got to be live instruments and a lot of depth as well.... It's been a long, evolutionary process, but I think it's safe to say that we are now a threesome. We've taken on a keyboardist named Lucian, who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a bizarre character. He fits in as though he was always there, it's strange." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Fr. , the Bible's {{description}} of creation {{is not a}} [...] "scientific account". It is not read for scientific knowledge but for spiritual truth and divine revelation. The physical-scientific side {{of the origins of}} mankind, though important, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> secondary in significance to the Church's message. The central image of Adam as God's image and likeness, who also represents fallen and sinful humanity, and the new Adam, Jesus Christ, who is the [...] "beginning", the first-born of the dead (Colossians 1:18) and the [...] "first-fruits" [...] of those who were dead, and are now alive (1 Corinthians 15:20–23), is what is really important.|$|E

The [...] author wrote a 12-part series of articles on his analysis of LMDB, beginning July 9, 2013. The conclusion was in the lines of [...] "impressive codebase ... dearly needs some love", mainly because of too long methods and code duplication. [...] This review, conducted by a [...]NET developer with no former experience of C, concluded on August 22, 2013 with [...] "beyond my issues with the code, the implementation <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> brilliant.

2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} reportedly {{went out}} of its way to make the transition as seamless as possible for the incoming administration, earning accolades from Obama staff members and outside experts alike. According to nearly all accounts, the Bush administration streamlined the process for new officials to obtain security clearances and planned training exercises for the incoming national security team, to ensure that they would be ready to face a possible crisis on the first day in office. Part of this enhanced cooperation is required by laws passed at the behest of the 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern. [...] "I'm not sure I've ever seen an outgoing administration work as hard at saying the right thing", said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> memorable." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{issue that}} affects all the {{international}} {{partners in the}} F-35 involves access to the computer software codes for the aircraft. The F-35 relies heavily on software for operation of radar, weapons, flight controls and also maintenance. The US military has stated that [...] "no country involved {{in the development of}} the jets will have access to the software codes" [...] and has indicated that all software upgrades will be done in the US. The US government acknowledges that Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey have all expressed dissatisfaction with that unilateral US decision. The UK specifically indicated they might cancel its entire order of F-35s without access to the coding, without which the nation will be unable to maintain its own aircraft. Allen Sens, a defence analyst at the University of British Columbia stated in November 2009: [...] "What has happened <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> unusual because we're talking about some of America's very close allies. You would have thought they could build in some maintenance codes that could be accessible to their allies." [...] Sens indicated that the decision could be as a result of concerns about software security and also pressure from Congress to protect jobs in the US.|$|E
2500|$|Miller was {{determined}} the production {{not become a}} farce, and in that vein, two keys texts were Lawrence Stone's The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500-1800 and Michael Walzer's The Revolution of the Saints, which he used to help ground his interpretation in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio's actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista's. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung {{at the end of}} the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 ("Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord"), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare's own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states [...] "I had to give [...] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come to love each other by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement." [...] Along these lines, Miller was also insistent that to interpret the play in light of twentieth century feminism was a flawed approach; [...] "what we think now <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> beside the point. If everything is done in the light of what we think, it's a sort of historical egocentricity, which is quite intolerable." [...] Diana E. Henderson was unimpressed with this approach, however, writing [...] "it was the perfect production to usher in the neo-conservative 1980s" [...] and [...] "this BBC-TV museum piece unabashedly celebrates the order achieved through female submission." ...|$|E
