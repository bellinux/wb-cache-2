5000|$|Between {{the world}} wars, {{development}} focused on existing multiple-track lines, and adding a second track to most main lines. An electrification process started, based on Kálmán Kandó's patent on a single-phase 16 kV 50 Hz AC traction and his newly designed MÁV Class V40 locomotive, which used a rotary phase converter unit {{to transform the}} catenary high voltage current into multiphase current with regulated low voltage that fed the single multi-phase AC <b>induction</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor.</b> Most main lines' cargo and passenger trains were hauled by the MÁV Class 424 steam locomotive, which became the MÁV's workhorse in the late steam era. From 1928 onwards 4- and 6-wheeled gasoline (and later diesel) railcars were purchased (Class BCmot) and by 1935 57% of branch lines were served by railcars. The rest of MÁV's passenger network remained steam based with slow pre-war locomotives and 3rd class [...] "wooden bench" [...] carriages (called [...] in Hungarian, a name nowadays applied to low cost airlines).|$|E

40|$|AbstractHealth {{estimate}} of loco mechanical transmission components usually implies the on-board installation of fit-to-purpose devices {{and the use}} of specific protocols for data acquisition. In this paper the authors present a different approach, based on the acquisition and post-processing of the stator currents of an <b>induction</b> <b>traction</b> <b>motor,</b> easy to be measured and already monitored by standard on-board automation systems. The use of a PWM inverter for the electrical drive of the traction unit introduces harmonics in the stator currents, and an analogous effect is due to the presence, for instance, of a bearing fault. For this reason, the authors have paid great attention to the choice of a reliable de-noising technique for the removal of the harmonic content due to the electronic conversion unit. The so cleaned stator current time series have been then processed by the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method, in order to identify some current “features” able to predict motor condition.

Five European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden), where electricity is three-phase AC as 50 Hz, have standardised on single-phase AC at 15 kV 16⅔ Hz for railway electrification; phase converters are, therefore, used to change both phases and frequency.

30|$|<b>Traction</b> <b>motors,</b> as {{the power}} source of trains [7], can be {{categorized}} both as DC and AC types. Compared with a DC <b>traction</b> <b>motor,</b> an AC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> has properties of high-power density, low costs, simple and reliable structure, good anti-idling performance, etc. In addition, the absence of mechanical parts in DC <b>traction</b> <b>motors,</b> such as the commutator, makes AC <b>traction</b> <b>motors</b> more suitable for operation of high-power, high-speed trains. Therefore, the AC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> is replacing the DC <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> and has become the main power source for trunk railways and urban rail transit.|$|R
40|$|Electric Railway Traction Drive {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as a solution to}} the environmental problem caused by the diesel or steam engines. Generally, an AC electrified railway system is supplied with 25 kV, 50 Hz AC supply. It is fed to the <b>traction</b> <b>motor</b> after stepping down to three phase, 400 V, 50 Hz {{with the help of a}} transformer. This magnetically coupled transformer lead to high weight, several losses and reduced efficiency. The railway electric traction requires high voltage operation. This is achieved with the help of multilevel inverter. Among the various multilevel inverters, the cascaded multilevel inverter is best suited for railway traction application because of its modular structure and use of low rating devices. The three phase induction motors are widely used in the railway traction drive because of its low cost and weight, better torque characteristics, high reliability and less maintenance due to the absence of brushes. This thesis presents the application of the cascaded multilevel inverter in the transformerless railway traction drive. Cascaded inverters up to eleven level have been simulated to find that THD increases with the increase in the voltage level. Various modulation techniques- Phase Shifted Modulation, Level Shifted Modulation and Selective Harmonic Elimination techniques were implemented in the multilevel inverters to find out the best modulation techniques among them. It was found that SHE technique resulted in low THD. Thus, an IGBT based-cascaded eleven level inverter with SHE method has been modelled to lower the supply voltage to a level convenient for the <b>traction</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors.</b> This eliminates the need of a transformer in the railway traction drives and also results in the reduction in the Total Harmonic Distortion of the voltage to be supplied to the <b>traction</b> <b>motors...</b>|$|R
