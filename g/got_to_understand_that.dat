25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 2008, McCain {{criticized the}} {{traditional}} pay-as-you-go financing of Social Security, saying: [...] "Americans have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{we are paying}} present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that's a disgrace." [...] The next day, he reiterated that Social Security uses current workers' tax payments to fund current retirees' benefits, and he said, [...] "That’s why it’s broken, that’s why we can fix it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent {{independent}} research by Phil Birnbaum, Clifford Blau and Tom Tippett confirmed Wright's findings, but Wright still praises McCracken as [...] "...

25|$|What he has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> is <b>that</b> we were {{speaking}} the truth for 23 years and apologies have only {{started to come}} today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|R

"She <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{she knew}} where she was; that the current set {{westerly}} along shore and in two hours would drift us abreast of a spot where we could land. I swear I either slept or was unconscious most of those two hours; and I swear she was in one state or the other when I chanced to come to and noted {{the absence of the}} roar of the surf. Then {{it was my turn to}} claw and maul her back to consciousness. It was three hours more before we made the sand. We slept where we crawled out of the water. Next morning's sun burnt us awake, and we crept into the shade of some wild bananas, found fresh water, and went to sleep again. Next I awoke it was night. I took another drink, and slept through till morning. She was still asleep when the bunch of kanakas, hunting wild goats from the next valley, found us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jonathan transcends into {{a society}} where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after {{practicing}} hard alone {{for a long time}} and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent student is raised into almost sacred levels. They, regardless of the all immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together: [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull."

2500|$|... "That's a funny story. I {{was with}} this fella down in Alices Springs and I'd been {{playing by the}} river. We were walking back when we noticed this mob of blackfellas in a circle about a hundred yards to our right. They motioned me to play without speaking. I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit.

2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this? We have got to understand and I respect both of my fellow candidates, but we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> this is not about us personally, it is about what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in", Edwards began to get applause from several members of the audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you look}} here! The {{first thing you}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> is <b>that</b> all this uplift and flipflop and settlement-work and {{recreation}} is nothing in God's world but the entering wedge for socialism. The sooner a man learns he isn't going to be coddled, and he needn't expect a lot of free grub and, uh, all these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his kids unless he earns 'em, why, the sooner he'll get {{on the job and}} produce--produce--produce! That's what the country needs, and not all this fancy stuff that just enfeebles the will-power of the working man and gives his kids a lot of notions above their class. And you--if you'd tend to business instead of fooling and fussing--All the time! When I was a young man I made up my mind what I wanted to do, and stuck to it through thick and thin, and that's why I'm where I am to-day, and--Myra! What do you let the girl chop the toast up into these dinky little chunks for? Can't get your fist onto 'em. Half cold, anyway!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, Molly, I {{was about}} to say, when my {{secretary}} interrupted me, that he and I have at last come to an agreement. After much explanation, I have <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a king cannot possibly manage all his own affairs with his own hands, and that I am forced to have a secretary, who can at least do the `three R's' pretty well. You see, although my edication has not been neglected, it still remains a fact that I can't read without specs, that in cipherin' I am slow--slow, though sure--and that {{in the matter of}} penmanship I am neither swift nor legible. Therefore, seein' that in such things I don't differ much from other kings and great men, Jeff has generously consented to refuse the lucrative sitooation under Goverment, with nothin' partik'lar to do, which has been offered to him, and to accept the secretary of state-ship, now at the disposal of King Richard, who will give him at least as good a salary as Government, {{and at the same time}} keep his nose closer to the grindstone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Although {{knowing that}} Colonel Allen {{is in charge}} of this force, he [...] claimed the right to take command, and, so the {{corporal}} says, made [...] display of a commission signed by the Massachusetts Committee of [...] Safety, declaring that it entitled him to take charge of all the [...] troops. Now, although I'm not a soldier--the corporal says I never [...] will be--I've <b>got</b> sense enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if I enlisted under [...] Colonel Easton, and was willing he should give way to Colonel Allen so [...] we might have the Green Mountain Boys with us, the Massachusetts [...] Committee of Safety have <b>got</b> nothing <b>to</b> do with saying who shall lead [...] in the battle--though I hope to goodness we shan't see one.|$|R

In the first place, then, sir, I have lived long enough on this water to know that every man is a lover of liberty in his own person, {{and that he has}} a secret distaste for it in the persons of other people. Then, sir, I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> patriotism means bread and cheese, and that opposition is every man for himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Holt was {{energetic}} and passionate rather than discreet. She would not admit that her child had done any wrong, {{and could not}} be <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> but <b>that</b> the law should make a husband live with his wife in the proper way. It was monstrous to her thinking that her daughter should be married and taken away, and then sent back, without any offence on her part. In the resentment which she felt against Mr. Western she filled quite a new part among the people of Exeter. [...] "Oh, mamma; you are so loving, so good," [...] said her daughter; [...] "but do not let us talk about it! Cannot you <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> angry as I am, I cannot endure to have him abused?" [...] "Abused!" [...] said Mrs. Holt, kindling in her wrath. [...] "I cannot hold myself without abusing him." [...] But it very soon did come to pass that Mr. Western's name was not mentioned between them. Mrs. Holt would now and again clench her fist and shake her head, and Cecilia knew that in her thoughts she was executing some vengeance against Mr. Western; but there was a truce to spoken words. Cecilia indeed often executed her vengeance against her husband after some fashion of her own, but her mother did not perceive it.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Florence Mountjoy was not passing her time pleasantly at Brussels. Various {{troubles}} there attended her. All her friends around her {{were opposed to}} her marriage with Harry Annesley. Harry Annesley had become a very unsavory word in the mouths of Sir Magnus and the British Embassy generally. Mrs. Mountjoy told her grief to her brother-in-law, who thoroughly took her part, as did also, very strongly, Lady Mountjoy. It <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be generally <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> Harry was a mauvais sujet. Such was the name that was attached to him, and the belief so conveyed was thoroughly entertained by them all. Sir Magnus had written to friends in London, and the friends in London bore out the reports that were so conveyed. The story of the midnight quarrel was told in a manner very prejudicial to poor Harry, and both Sir Magnus and his wife saw the necessity of preserving their niece from anything so evil as such a marriage. But Florence was very firm, and {{was considered to be}} very obstinate. To her mother she was obstinate but affectionate To Sir Magnus she was obstinate and in some degree respectful. But to Lady Mountjoy she was neither affectionate nor respectful. She took a great dislike to Lady Mountjoy, who endeavored to domineer; and who, by the assistance of the two others, was in fact tyrannical. It was her opinion that the girl should be compelled to abandon the man, and Mrs. Mountjoy found herself constrained to follow this advice. She did love her daughter, who was her only child. The main interest of her life was centred in her daughter. Her only remaining ambition rested on her daughter's marriage. She had long revelled in the anticipation of being the mother-in-law of the owner of Tretton Park. She had been very proud of her daughter's beauty.|$|R

6000|$|Meanwhile {{the party}} at the wreck found {{themselves}} in the unpleasant condition of having nothing fresh to eat. As we have said, the trapper had left them, knowing that the fur-traders and the Indians were quite capable of looking after their wants. But soon afterwards the Indians went away down the gulf to hunt seals, {{and none of the}} McLeods being able to speak their language, they could not, or would not, be <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> one of them was wanted to remain and hunt for the sick man. As McLeod had still some provisions on hand, with a gun and ammunition besides his boat, he did not much mind the departure of the red men at the time. As time wore on, however, and their fresh provisions failed, he became anxious, and wished that he had not so angrily declined the aid offered by the fur-traders. Neither father nor son had the slightest taste for field sports, so that when they saw the track of an animal they found it almost impossible to follow it up with success, and when, by good fortune, they chanced to discover a [...] "partridge" [...] or a squirrel they invariably missed it! This incapacity and a scarcity of game had at last reduced them to extremities.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{also showed}} remorse for killing the child, [...] "That wasn't me, Cain, you know that. I wasn't {{in my right}} mind... You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand...</b> <b>that</b> mad life, before... it was like some dream." ...|$|E
