25|$|The Free Syrian Army {{clashed with}} Jabhat al Nusra on various {{occasions}} in 2013. In March 2013, the al-Nusra Front {{set up a}} checkpoint and captured 33 fighters from the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> in Tell Abyad. Clashes {{between the two groups}} resulted in the Farouq commander, Abu Azzam, being wounded in action. He and other wounded rebels was transferred to a hospital in Şanlıurfa, Turkey. The next week, the 33 Farouq prisoners were released and the border crossing was reopened.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day or the next day, Abu Sakkar, an al-Nusra Front {{commander}} infamous for eating a dead Syrian soldier's heart {{when he was the}} commander of the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> in 2013, was stopped at an Ahrar ash-Sham checkpoint while driving on the road between the towns of Salqin and Harem. The Ahrar fighters attempted to arrest him when he resisted arrest and drove away toward Harem, resulting in a pursuit by the Ahrar militants. Upon reaching the town, Abu Sakkar attempted to reach for his gun and was fatally shot by his pursuers.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2012, the {{northern}} {{branch of the}} <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> was accused of kidnapping and killing Abu Mohamad al-Absi, a Syrian Jihadist who led a group of foreign fighters. The local <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> leader said the foreign fighters had ignored their demands to leave the Bab al-Hawa border post. He said that al-Absi had [...] "raised the al-Qaeda flag, and al-Qaeda is not welcomed by us".|$|E
50|$|Jeffrey White, {{a former}} U.S. defense {{intelligence}} {{officer with the}} Washington Institute for Near East Policy and Joseph Holliday, a research analyst with the Institute for the Study of War consider the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigade</b> to be “moderately Islamist” - that is, neither secular nor Salafis. While many of their fighters wear Jihadist-style black headbands and beards, {{it is unclear how}} much of this is genuine belief and how much is to secure additional funding from Islamist donors.|$|R
50|$|The {{coalition}} {{included some}} of the most important rebel units active in the civil war, including the Suqour al-Sham <b>Brigade</b> (Idlib), <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigade</b> (Homs), Liwa al-Islam (Damascus) and Tawhid Brigade (Aleppo). Other prominent groups in the coalition included Liwa Dawud, the Deir ez-Zor Revolutionary Council (Deir ez-Zor), Tajamo Ansar al-Islam (Damascus), Amr Ibn al-Aas Brigade (Aleppo), and al-Naser Salaheddin Brigade (Latakia). These groups were geographically scattered, varied in size and influence, and were dependent on different sources of funding. It was unclear how effectively the coalition coordinated between the varying groups.|$|R
50|$|By late April 2012, {{despite a}} {{cease-fire}} being declared {{in the whole}} country, sporadic fighting continued, with heavy clashes specifically in Al-Qusayr, where rebel forces controlled {{the northern part of}} the city, while the military held the southern part. FSA forces were holding onto Al-Qusayr, due to it being the last major transit point toward the Lebanese border. A rebel commander from the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigade</b> in the town reported that 2,000 Farouq fighters had been killed in Homs province since August 2011. At this point, there were talks among the rebels in Al-Qusayr, where many of the retreating rebels from Homs city's Baba Amr district had gone, of Homs being abandoned completely. On 12 June 2012, the UN peacekeeping chief in Syria stated that, in his view, Syria has entered a period of civil war.|$|R

50|$|By November 2013, the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> was {{reported}} as having suffered a serious decline in strength and area of influence, with it having splintered into numerous smaller factions, {{such as the}} Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade and the Islamic al-Farouq Brigades. The group's presence outside Homs {{was said to have}} declined after losing feuds with more hardline Islamist rebel groups, like Ahrar ash-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra, resulting in Farouq being expelled from the Raqqa Governorate and losing control of the strategic border crossing at Tal Abyad. By 2014, the rebel Hazzm Movement contained several groups that were formerly part of the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In April 2012, the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> {{was accused}} of {{collecting}} jizyah, or taxes imposed on non-Muslims living under Muslim rule, in Christian areas of Homs province. However, the group denied this and the Institute for the Study of War said that [...] "the accusation is likely from the Assad regime". There were also reports that the group had expelled 90% of the Christian population of Homs City. However, Jesuits in Homs disputed {{the cause of the}} exodus, and said that Christians were not targeted specifically, but fled the city on their own initiative because of the ongoing conflict. According to interviews made by McClatchy Newspapers of refugees in Lebanon, there was no targeting of Christians because of their religion. Rather, a number of government-affiliated Christians were seized by the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades,</b> which led to some Christians fleeing the area.|$|E
50|$|On 26 July 2012, Firas Tlass {{expressed}} {{his support for}} Bashar Assad’s resignation.

5000|$|Sources {{inside the}} Syrian Orthodox Church have {{reported}} an [...] "ongoing ethnic cleansing of Christians" [...] is {{being carried out}} by the Free Syrian Army. In a communication received by Agenzia Fides, the sources claimed that over 90% of the Christians of Homs have been expelled by militant Islamists of the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> who went door to door, forcing Christians to flee without their belongings and confiscating their homes. The Christian population of Homs had dropped from a pre-conflict total of 160,000 down to about 1,000.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> (كتائب الفاروق), also spelt Farooq and Farook, was a armed rebel {{organisation}} {{formed by}} a number of Homs based members of the Free Syrian Army early in the Syrian Civil War. The group rapidly expanded in size and prominence in 2012, before suffering internal splits and battlefield reversals in 2013 that greatly reduced its influence. By 2014, the group was largely defunct, with member factions joining other rebel groups. The brigades were named Farouq after Omar bin al-Khattab, a Sahaba (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the second Caliph.|$|E
50|$|In September 2012, a {{large number}} of Islamist rebel brigades, {{including}} the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> and the Suquor al-Sham formed the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, under the leadership of Suquor al-Sham commander Ahmed Abu Issa. Abu Issa claimed the new Front had more than 40,000 fighters, and aimed to establish a state with an Islamic reference. In May 2013, the BBC gave estimate of 20,000 fighters. In November 2013, the SILF was superseded by a new rebel coalition called the Islamic Front; however, Farouq was not a member of this grouping.|$|E

5000|$|On 24 May, a UN panel {{reported}} that, {{beside a}} number of human rights violations committed by the Syrian military, observing that [...] "state security forces continued to use lethal force against anti-government demonstrations in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama , Damascus - [...] " [...] and that [...] "too often civilians bore {{the brunt of the}} violence" [...] - the rebel FSA was also responsible for the torture and execution of {{a number of}} captured soldiers. The sources for the panel's report included eyewitness accounts from FSA fighters {{who were involved in the}} killings. One defector belonging to the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> stated that they executed government soldiers after they confessed, during torture, to crimes against civilians. Among those killed were allegedly three Iranian snipers. In the Jabal al Zawiya and Deir Sinbal districts, FSA makeshift prisons were reportedly set up for captured soldiers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> {{emerged from}} the central city of Homs just months into the Syrian Civil War. Its {{beginnings}} are as a subunit of the Khalid ibn al-Walid Brigade, a group of defectors from the Syrian Army that announced its formation in June 2011 and engaged in clashes {{with members of the}} Syrian security forces in Homs and Al-Rastan. The group started out with 3,000+ fighters. During the second half of 2011, Farouq was active in Homs, particularly the Baba Amr neighborhood. It was led by a defector, Lieutenant Abdul Razaq Tlass, who was a nephew of the former Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass. The apparent success of Farouq in holding territory in Baba Amr lead to the Syrian government escalating their use of force in an offensive in early 2012, causing heavy casualties amongst the rebels and forcing their retreat into the Homs countryside and the towns of Al-Qusayr and Al-Rastan.|$|E
5000|$|Heavy {{shelling}} {{continued on}} 29 February as government forces launched an operation to retake {{control of the}} Baba Amr neighbourhood. The Syrian government announced that the army was being sent into the area and were [...] "cleaning" [...] it from rebel fighters, and that the operation would be over {{in a matter of}} hours. Helicopter gunships were reported to have fired upon FSA fighters and civilians, according to people on the ground. At least 11 people were reported killed initially, including a family of five. Water supplies, electricity and communications were entirely cut off in the Baba Amr district according to opposition activists. Heavy clashes continued throughout the day, as the Syrian Army's 4th Armoured Division sent in tanks and infantry. Although the FSA <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> defending Baba Amr stated that they would fight to the last man, it was reported that some of the FSA leaders already made an escape from the district.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 May, Al Jazeera {{reporter}} James Bays {{ventured to}} Qusayr {{and found that}} there were two main brigades of opposition fighters in the city. The 77th Brigade was a unit made up almost entirely of former government soldiers. In the town, they were under the command of a captain who used to head an elite commando unit in the national army. They were well trained, according to Bays. The other brigade was the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> which had many civilian volunteers but was mostly made up of army defectors. The brigades were under the same overall commander, a colonel in the town. He said that [...] "tanks are always repositioning. About a week ago, more than 15 tanks have violated the ceasefire in an attempt by the regime to cut off the city and divided into sectors." [...] In the following weeks, three civilians were killed on 29 May after the army shelled Al-Qusayr.|$|E
5000|$|Free Syrian Army units {{specialize}} in different tasks. Units {{close to the}} borders are involved with logistics and the transport of injured soldiers {{out of the country}} and also with the transport medical equipment, material supplies and weapons into the country. Other units such as the <b>Farouq</b> <b>Brigades</b> which are based in the city of Homs are involved in protecting civilians and fending off the Syrian army. The Farouq Brigade {{is one of the more}} active FSA battalion units. It is led by Lieutenant Abdul-Razzaq Tlass, the nephew of former Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass. Lieutenant Tlass was one of the first defectors and is one of the key figures in the Syrian uprising. His unit of 500-2,000 soldiers has engaged the Syrian army in Homs and raided Syrian checkpoints and command centers. , the army had around 37 named battalion units, 17-23 of which appeared to be engaged in combat. In October 2012 the Time magazine reported that the FSA was [...] "never more than an umbrella term that provided political cover for the loose franchise of defectors and armed civilians fighting Assad’s regime" [...] and some units were merely made up of a few dozen fighters.|$|E
