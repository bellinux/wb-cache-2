5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must {{also be able to}} sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

25|$|Cheating {{differs from}} most {{other forms of}} {{academic}} dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly telegraphed answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students {{in the same class}} but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If the student in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, two {{different}} dialects of Judeo-Spanish were spoken in the Mediterranean region: Eastern Judeo-Spanish (in various distinctive regional variations) and Western or North African Judeo-Spanish (also known as Ḥakitía), once spoken, with little regional distinction, in six towns in Northern Morocco and, because of later emigration, also in Ceuta and Melilla (Spanish cities in North Africa), Gibraltar, Casablanca (Morocco), and Oran (Algeria). The Eastern Sephardic dialect is typified by its greater conservatism, its retention of numerous Old Spanish features in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and its numerous borrowings from Turkish and, {{to a lesser}} extent, also from Greek and South Slavic. Both dialects have (or had) numerous borrowings from Hebrew, especially in reference to religious matters, {{but the number of}} Hebraisms in everyday speech or writing <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> comparable to that found in Yiddish.|$|E

25|$|The {{recovery}} {{swings the}} arms sideways {{across the water}} surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward {{from the end of}} the underwater movement, the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forwards relaxed yet quickly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, this arm recovery is a ballistic shot. The only other way of lifting the arms and the shoulders out of the water is by dropping one's hip. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> relaxed. It is important not to enter the water too early, because this would generate extra resistance as the arms moved forward in the water against the swimming direction, however, during longer distances, this cannot be avoided, and it is more important to avoid dropping one's hips. A high elbow recovery, as in front crawl, would be disadvantageous because of the natural undulations that are partially caused by the recovery and the relaxed movement caused by the momentum of a triceps extension. Limitations of the shoulder movement in the human body make such a motion unlikely. Hands should enter into the water again at 11 and one with thumbs entering first and pinkie last.|$|E

500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "doves" [...] and [...] "pigeons" [...] is not consistent. In modern everyday speech, {{as opposed to}} scientific usage or former usage, [...] "dove" [...] frequently indicates a pigeon that is white or nearly white. However, some people use the terms [...] "dove" [...] and [...] "pigeon" [...] interchangeably. In contrast, in scientific and ornithological practice, [...] "dove" [...] tends {{to be used for}} smaller species and [...] "pigeon" [...] for larger ones, but this <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> consistently applied. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms.

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the novel were varied. The New Yorker declared Lee [...] "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer", and The Atlantic Monthlys reviewer rated the book [...] "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible. Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it [...] "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life" [...] and calls Scout Finch [...] "the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at the wedding". The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> a sociological novel. It underlines no cause... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance." ...|$|E

Ellis also noted that co-writer Emeli Sandé's [...] "candid and immediate charm" [...] is present on the song, and described it as the [...] "perfect" [...] ending to the album.

500|$|Lane {{returned}} to acting {{to appear in}} The Big Town and Lady Beware, but Lane had not made another big impression on a sizable audience until 1989's popular and critically acclaimed TV miniseries Lonesome Dove, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role. She {{came very close to}} being cast as Vivian Ward in 1990's blockbuster hit Pretty Woman (which had a much darker script at the time), but due to scheduling, was unable to take the role. Apparently, costume fittings were made for Lane, before the role fell to Julia Roberts. She was given positive reviews for her performance in the independent film My New Gun, which was well received at the Cannes Film Festival. She went on to appear as actress Paulette Goddard in Sir Richard Attenborough's big-budget biopic of Charles Chaplin, 1992's Chaplin. Over the next seven years Lane would star in ten movies, among them were Jack and Judge Dredd. It wasn't until 1999 that Lane earned further recognition for her role in A Walk on the Moon. The film also stars Liev Schreiber, Viggo Mortensen, and Anna Paquin. One reviewer wrote, [...] "Lane, after years in post-teenaged-career limbo, is meltingly effective." [...] The film's director, Tony Goldwyn, described Lane as having [...] "...this potentially volcanic sexuality that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> self-conscious or opportunistic." [...] Lane earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead. At this time, she was interested in making a film about actress Jean Seberg in which she would play Seberg.|$|E
