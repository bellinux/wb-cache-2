5|$|The {{music played}} during the {{broadcast}} of the 1939 radio speech at {{the climax of the}} film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor.

5|$|Though park keepers {{featured}} {{that the}} crowd would cause {{damage to the}} park, an official estimate suggested the cost was only around £100 (now £). Park superintendent John Hare reported the most serious damage was to a silver birch tree planted the previous year. <b>He</b> <b>praised</b> the concertgoers, many of whom helped clear up after the concert and were awarded with a free Stones LP if they returned a full sack.|$|E
5|$|Tod's {{major works}} have been criticised as {{containing}} significant inaccuracies and bias, {{but he is}} highly regarded {{in some areas of}} India, particularly in communities whose ancestors <b>he</b> <b>praised.</b> His accounts of the Rajputs and of India in general had a significant effect on British views of the area for many years.|$|E
5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. <b>He</b> <b>praised</b> Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. <b>He</b> <b>praised</b> {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although <b>he</b> <b>praised</b> Eastwood's performance.|$|E

Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works.

5|$|In January 2003, Raël held a {{ceremony}} {{at which he}} thanked Boisselier for her service and anointed her as his successor. <b>He</b> <b>praised</b> her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning.

As a freshman in his party, he was unable to secure a seat on the Education Committee which he had sought.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a good sense of position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. <b>He</b> <b>praised</b> manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Staunton's often-criticized {{description}} of Anderssen as Germany's second best player, after Anderssen {{had won the}} 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable {{on the basis of}} what is now known about von der Lasa's skill. Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: a large percentage of his 1860 book Chess Praxis was devoted to Morphy's games, which <b>he</b> <b>praised</b> highly; and in The Chess-Player's Companion (1849) Staunton sometimes criticised his own play, and presented a few of his losses.|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work <b>he</b> <b>praised</b> Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an open question, {{but it has been}} conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E

Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E

In 1764, the north gatehouse was partially demolished by Coryndon Carpenter, a former mayor of Launceston and the castle's constable, who used the materials to help built a new mansion alongside the castle, called Eagle House.
