5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> show what is happening.|$|E
25|$|The Lebanese {{minister}} {{of foreign affairs}} criticised the <b>drawings</b> saying <b>that</b> freedom of speech ends when sacred values are offended.|$|R
50|$|He {{was with}} the forces that liberated the Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, and {{made a series of}} dramatic <b>drawings</b> on <b>that</b> subject.|$|R
50|$|According to author Karl F. Friday, {{before the}} 13th century {{there are no}} written {{references}} or <b>drawings</b> etc. <b>that</b> show swords of any kind were actually used while on horseback.|$|R
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from his}} paintings, the illustrative skills of Paul Biva are {{revealed}} in his <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> he realized for the illustrated catalogs of the Salon des artistes fran√ßais between 1878 and 1901.|$|E
25|$|The Ordnance Survey Maps Collection {{includes}} near-to-complete {{coverage for}} Wales, beginning with photocopies of the Ordnance Surveyor's <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> {{formed the basis}} of the first edition of the one-inch-to-the-mile map which was published in 1818.|$|E

25|$|After the re-excavation {{the soil}} was replaced, {{following}} Sir Lindsay Scott's plans and <b>drawings,</b> so <b>that</b> {{the appearance of}} the barrow now corresponds with that existing at the start of excavations in 1934.|$|R
50|$|After 1574, the Lammen fort was {{eventually}} dismantled {{when the city}} of Leiden expanded its borders. Period <b>drawings</b> show <b>that</b> {{all that remained was}} the raised ground which had formed the basis for a fortified position.|$|R
25|$|Edakkal {{caves in}} Wayanad {{district}} of Kerala contain <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> range over periods from {{as early as}} 5000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The youngest group of paintings {{have been in the}} news for a possible connection to the Indus Valley Civilisation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, two papyrus {{fragments}} from Oxyrhynchus contain ink <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> illustrated {{characters from}} the play. They probably {{belonged to the}} same illustrated manuscript. P.Oxy. 2652 offers a frontal view of a woman tagged as Agnoia. P.Oxy. 2653 represents {{the face of a}} young soldier, obviously Polemon, in a helmet with cheek-pieces.|$|E
25|$|Advancements in {{computer}} science found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> previously {{had to be done}} manually. The completion of the Human Genome Project is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but genetic engineering and genomics as well. Chemical engineering principles were used to produce DNA sequences in large quantities.|$|E

50|$|A {{previous}} vicar of Newbald, Rev Jack Walker, {{during his}} incumbency mapped {{the whole area}} and produced detailed <b>drawings</b> suggesting <b>that</b> the village may have been walled. Apart from Rev Walker's submissions there is no further evidence of this.|$|R
50|$|Period III - (Chalcolithic) Similar to the {{paintings}} of the Mesolithic, these <b>drawings</b> reveal <b>that</b> during this period the cave dwellers of this area were {{in contact with the}} agricultural communities of the Malwa plains, exchanging goods with them.|$|R
25|$|The Bradshaws {{are not the}} regions' {{earliest}} paintings. The earlier art {{consists of}} crude animal <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> {{are believed to be}} up to 40,000 years old. The Bradshaws have nothing in common with this earlier art and first appeared following the peak of the most recent Pleistocene glacial maximum, which is dated between 26,500 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Since {{a reform}} of the French penal code, {{introduced}} in 2013, producing or distributing <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> represent a minor aged less than 15 years old is considered the same as producing real child pornography and is punishable by {{up to five years}} imprisonment and a 75000 euros fine, even if the drawings are not meant to be distributed.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{painting}} at Catherine de' Medici's court. In the last two decades of Catherine's life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities, Antoine Caron and Jean Cousin the Younger. The majority of paintings and portrait <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> have survived from the late Valois period remain difficult or impossible to attribute to particular artists.|$|E

50|$|The author (Clerk) {{has been}} unable to find whether the engine was ever made, but the {{knowledge}} of the detail essential to a working gas engine shown by the <b>drawings</b> indicates <b>that</b> it or some similar machine had been worked by the inventor.|$|R
50|$|Szombathy {{described}} {{both sexes}} of this ant-like species, with both about six millimeters long, {{and put them}} close to Agorius. His <b>drawings</b> suggest <b>that</b> A. formicaria might belong to Orsima. However, no study was published on it since its first description in 1915.|$|R
25|$|Business Management Perspective (Business Concepts) - Next are the architect's <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> {{depict the}} final {{building}} {{from the perspective}} of the owner, who will have to live with it in the daily routines of business. They correspond to the enterprise (business) models, which constitute the designs of the business and show the business entities and processes and how they relate.|$|E
25|$|The Whistle! {{series has}} {{received}} good reception. A review by Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics {{stated that the}} Whistle! manga had good <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> showed the characters move around with the soccer ball during matches. David Welsh of Precocious Curmudgeon said the series is very interesting that {{those who do not}} have soccer background will enjoy reading the manga, {{as well as with the}} realistic illustration used.|$|E
25|$|Giulio Campagnola, {{well known}} as the {{engraver}} who translated the Giorgionesque style into prints, but none of whose paintings are securely identified, is also sometimes also brought into consideration. For example, the late W.R. Rearick gave him Il Tramonto (see Gallery) and he is an alternative choice {{for a number of}} <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> might be by Titian or Giorgione, and both are sometimes credited with the design of some of his engravings.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 {{he founded}} the Mus√©e des Collections Historiques de la Pr√©fecture de Police in {{response}} to the Exposition Universelle. The museum concentrated on the forensic science of policing and has gradually grown through subsequent years. It now contains evidence, photographs, letters, memorabilia, and <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> reflect major events in the history of France (including conspiracies and arrests), famous criminal cases and characters, prisons, and daily life in the capital such as traffic and hygiene.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mishnah and Tosefta, in the Maccabean, Herodian, and Mishnaic periods, new {{months were}} {{determined}} by the sighting of a new crescent, with two eyewitnesses required to testify to the Sanhedrin to having seen the new lunar crescent at sunset. The practice {{in the time of}} Gamaliel II (c. 100 CE) was for witnesses to select the appearance of the moon from a collection of <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> depicted the crescent in a variety of orientations, only a few of which could be valid in any given month. These observations were compared against calculations.|$|E
25|$|While {{browsing}} the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi {{came across}} a copy of R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat (1969). Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Bakshi was interested in directing the film because he felt that Crumb's work was the closest to his own. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi showed Crumb <b>drawings</b> <b>that</b> had been created {{as the result of}} Bakshi attempting to learn Crumb's style to prove that he could translate the look of Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks as a reference.|$|E

40|$|Computer vision {{offers the}} ability to {{transform}} digitized <b>drawings</b> into documents <b>that</b> {{can be used with}} computer systems. Recognition of digitized drawings can occur at the levels of (a) geometric elements, (b) building elements, and (c) spatial articulation. The last two levels apply not only to digitized images but also to computer-produced ones. The enormous burden placed on the user for inputting and manipulating CAD <b>drawings</b> suggests <b>that</b> automated recognition can add to the capabilities of CAD by making the computer more flexible with respect to inputting design information and more responsive to the actual concerns of the designer...|$|R
50|$|The Kleiner Klebeband ("little glued binder") is a {{collection}} of over 120 drawings from the 15th and 16th century, which were combined into a leathern binder in the 19th century.
