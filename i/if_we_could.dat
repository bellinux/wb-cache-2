5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
25|$|Some {{transcription}} factors bind as dimers. Therefore, their binding sites may {{consist of}} two conserved regions, {{separated by a}} few variable nucleotides. Because of the variable internal sequence, the motif cannot be detected. However, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use a program to search for motifs containing a variable sequence in the middle, without counting mutations, these motifs could be discovered.|$|E
25|$|It {{is obvious}} that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find {{characters}} or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters insofar as {{they are subject to}} reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E

25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|But it was {{the site}} where that second piece of {{information}} led us that contained dynamite. From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} feature for Halo 2 was multiplayer. Multiplayer in Combat Evolved was accomplished via System Link, and only came together {{weeks before the}} game was released. Most players never played large maps, while a subset greatly enjoyed 16-player action via four networked consoles. [...] "We looked at the small set of fans {{who were able to}} do this," [...] said engineering lead Chris Butcher, [...] "and just how much they were enjoying themselves, and asked ourselves <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> bring that to everybody. That would be something really special, really unique." ...|$|E

The vast majority of Jews in Russia and America, as, indeed, all over the world, now appeared to be favourable to Zionism. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make a declaration favourable to such an ideal, {{we should be able}} to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and America." ...|$|E
500|$|At 16:56, Taylor {{was again}} asked {{to turn on}} his {{transmitter}} for YG if he had one. He did not acknowledge but {{a few minutes later}} advised his flight [...] "Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes." [...] About the same time someone in the flight said [...] "Dammit, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> just fly west we would get home; head west, dammit." [...] This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own. It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline.|$|E

500|$|Chapman's main {{contribution}} to the [...] "Dead Parrot sketch", derived from the How to Irritate People piece and involving a customer returning [...] a faulty toaster, was [...] "How can we make this madder?" [...] He decided to replace the toaster with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. Cleese {{said that he and}} Chapman believed that [...] "there was something very funny there, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find the right context for it". The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills in the group. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was [...] "particularly a wonderful actor".|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2004, {{the band}} {{continued}} to tour {{in support of}} The Artist in the Ambulance. Island Records issued a promotional disc (that features an alternate version of [...] "The Artist in the Ambulance") in early 2004 that would become the basis for <b>If</b> <b>We</b> <b>Could</b> Only See Us Now, a CD/DVD package outlining the group's career. Named after a lyric from [...] "So Strange I Remember You," [...] the CD portion contained live tracks from a performance at the Apple Store and various B-sides. A slot to promote the CD/DVD came on the 2004 Vans Warped Tour.|$|E
500|$|Hackett has {{considered}} the album {{to be his}} favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that was good news for us at that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time." [...] Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying {{there are a lot of}} high points but also some lows.|$|E

500|$|In 1999 Hale {{assembled}} {{a group of}} American scientists, students and educators {{to go on a}} 2 week+ trip to Iran (coinciding with a solar eclipse) where they gave talks throughout the country. Hale feels that [...] "Science is a... universal language" [...] and [...] "it would be a great idea <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use science as a tool to bring people together... to break down barriers between nations and between cultures." [...] Hale uses the expression 'Science Diplomacy' in this context, which he says it's possible he coined. [...] "The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US. It’s the same sky we study... Science does not know political boundaries." ...|$|E
500|$|Rockstar Games co-founder Terry Donovan responded, saying [...] "I {{would prefer}} it <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> simply make great games {{and not have}} to deal with {{misunderstanding}} and misperception of what we do." [...] After receiving no response from Rockstar regarding an advance copy, Thompson filed the public nuisance complaint against Wal-Mart, Take-Two Interactive, and GameStop, demanding that he be allowed to preview the game before its October 17 release date. Take-Two offered to bring in a copy and let both Judge Ronald Friedman and Thompson view the game in the judge's chambers on October 12, 2006. The judge ultimately saw no reason to restrict sales and dismissed the complaint the next day.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

500|$|After the series, it was {{reported}} that NHL president Clarence Campbell and Chicago Black Hawks' owner Bill Wirtz had concluded an agreement with the Soviets for the Soviet national team to play an exhibition series in January 1973 against the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Chicago Black Hawks. Campbell characterized the reports as [...] "presumptuous". The NHL and the Soviets had held talks during the Moscow games, during which the Soviets had requested further games, but Campbell stated [...] "we don't even know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> schedule such a series" [...] and [...] "we're a long way from any arrangement." [...] Although the 1973 exhibition series did not take place, exhibition series would take place a few years later.|$|E
500|$|The {{founders of}} Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as {{teenagers}} at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, {{went on to}} perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving {{alcohol and drug abuse}} rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, [...] "Wouldn't it be great <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do something in ?" ...|$|E
500|$|Many of The Simpsons writers {{had left}} the show or were absent at the {{beginning}} of season four, which left Al Jean and Mike Reiss to brainstorm plot ideas alone. After brainstorming [...] "Homer the Heretic", they thought of Lisa entering a beauty pageant. They assigned Jeff Martin to write the episode because they assumed he would fill it with songs, like he had done on previous episodes. Martin obliged, and wrote the episode and its music. He also based the episode on some of his own experiences, such as the scene where Lisa has a caricature of herself drawn. According to Jeff Martin, [...] "I'm not sure <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do this episode today. People had a more innocent view of child beauty pageants before JonBenet Ramsey." ...|$|E

2500|$|By another approach, one {{achieves}} {{peace and}} agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), {{but on the}} common environment. [...] The reasoning: [...] As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an ecosystem that supports life. Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> weren't, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The anthropic principle in cosmology recognizes this view.|$|R
