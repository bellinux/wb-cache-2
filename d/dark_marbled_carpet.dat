A wild longing seized him; he would escape up thither; up into those clouds, up anywhere to be alone--alone with his miserable self. That was dreadful enough: but less dreadful than having a companion,--ay, even a stone by him--which could remind him of the scene which he had left; even remind him {{that there was another}} human being on earth beside himself. Yes,--to put that cliff between him and all the world!

5000|$|Osteopilus is a genus {{of frogs}} in the Hylidae family. These species have a bony co-ossification on the skull {{resulting}} in a casque, hence its name ‘bone-cap’, from [...] (‘bone’) and the Greek [...] ( [...] , ‘felt cap’). Color varies between uniform brown, brown-gray, or olive with <b>darker</b> markings or <b>marbled</b> with greens, grays or brown, making a distinct pattern. The finger disks are round; the fingers with a reduced webbing; eyes and tympanum are large. Their natural range includes the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas, but O. septentrionalis has also been introduced to the Lesser Antilles, Hawaii and Florida (USA).|$|R
50|$|The white eggs of the {{red-necked footman}} are laid {{in small groups}} in crevices in the {{branches}} of trees, especially those of old firs.. They grow to a length of about 27 mm. Their head is black with a bold diagonal white stripe on either side. Their main colour is <b>dark</b> greenish-grey <b>marbled</b> with cream. Each segment bears six tiny reddish yellow warts which bear black hairs. The caterpillars feed on lichens growing on the trunks and branches of trees, {{and can be found}} between August and October. They pupate before winter sets in and overwinter as glossy brownish red pupae, in a loosecocoon buried among moss and leaf litter. The moths fly between May and July depending on their location. They are mostly nocturnal, being attracted to lights, but also sometimes fly by day. Sometimes the moths feed at Scabious and other flowers in the sunshine, but usually rest in day-time on the long branches of firs overhanging paths in woods, where they may be obtained by beating.|$|R
