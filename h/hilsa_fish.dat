40|$|The {{migration}} of the Indian Shad, Hilsa ilisha (Hamilton), up the major river systems {{when they are}} in floods is well known. Some time ago, while making observations on the biology and fishery of Hilsa in Bengal and Orissa, a regular small-scale movement of the fish was noticed from the lower reaches of estuaries soon after the peak of winter season, {{even in the absence of}} floods (Jones, 1952). The observations were summarised by the author in the following lines (Jones, 1952, p. 66). " The two periods of {{migration of}} the fish observed during the years under study both in the Chilka Lake and the Hooghly River were correlated with floods during the monsoon rains and to the general rise in temperature of the water in the estuaries after the close of winter. " In the Hooghly, this ascent of the fish takes place usually early in February and is also associated with some breeding activity (Jones and Menon, 1951). During this time <b>Hilsa</b> <b>fishing</b> operations are carried out in the river on a small-scale with the help of the Clapnet, shangla-jal. In the Chilka Lake, in Orissa, a similar migration takes place in January-February when the fish is reported to be caught in the channel area connecting the sea and the lake (Jones and Sujansingani, 1951). It is of interest to mention here that a similar activity has been recorded by Kulkarni (1951) for the Hilsa in the Narbada where there is a small run beginning in March and continuing up to the middle of April. After referring to the early run of Hilsa in the Indus and the Irrawaddy due to floods caused by the melting of snows,, he says that " in the Narbada, however, there is no such possibility, as at no stage the river passes through any snow clad mountains and there is not the slightest increase in the level of water in March and April". In the Indus the Hilsa comes up from the sea by about February and forms a fishery in the river from March to September (Day,, 1873 and Quereshi, 1952). In the rivers of Burma also, it is reported to move up at the close of winter just as in Bengal (Kyaw, 1955) ...|$|R

The study revealed a positive impact of fishing ban during spawning season on reproduction success of hilsa. Proportionate distribution of male and female hilsa also showed a significant level of distribution in and around the spawning grounds where the ratio was 35 : 65. Percent of oozing <b>hilsa</b> during <b>fishing</b> ban period in the spawning grounds was observed 1. 61 %. About 5 % spent hilsa was observed in the fish landing centers and was compared with the data of Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) studies and was found about 2. 80 - 3. 57 times higher than that of the findings of 2002 and 2003. Estimated egg production value showed about 46, 800 Kg of eggs could have been produced that indicating a positive impact of 10 days fishing ban in spawning season. Abundance of higher percentages of gravid hilsa was found which were not available in the same quantity and condition in the non-fishing ban period. During the present investigation, fairly higher amount of spent hilsa and juveniles were also observed in the spawning grounds. Along with the jatka fry, spawn and fries of other fishes were also found in higher quantity than the previous years and thus it is assumed that fishing ban also might have positive impact on the successful breeding of other fishes. Overall, the fishing ban was found effective for successful breeding of hilsa...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the quality of <b>hilsa</b> <b>fish</b> during icing and freezing storage at - 20 °C by determining organoleptic and bacteriological aspects. The fishes stored in ice were organoleptically in acceptable condition 2 for 20 days. The bacterial load in muscles of 4 days ice stored fish was 2. 5 x 10 ² CFU/g which gradually increased up to 1. 8 x 10 ⁵ CFU/g after 20 days when the fishes were organoleptically in acceptable condition. The keeping qualities of different days of ice stored fishes were also evaluated during their subsequent frozen storage at - 20 °C. Both 4 and 7 days of ice stored fishes were organoleptically in acceptable condition up to 48 weeks but the highest degree of freshness was found for fish stored in ice for 4 days before freezing at - 20 °C. The result indicates that the longer is the duration of ice storage before freezing, the shorter is the shelf life of the fish. The initial bacterial load prior to freezing of the 4 and 7 days of ice stored samples were 2. 5 x 10 ³ CFU/g and 3. 8 x 10 ⁴ CFU/g, respectively which reduced to 2. 21 x 10 ² CFU/g and 2. 38 x 10 ² CFU/g, respectively {{at the end of}} the 24 weeks of frozen storage.

40|$|AbstractHilsa (Tenualosa ilisha Hamilton) as {{a single}} species {{accounts}} 12 % {{for more than half}} of the total marine catches. About 2 % of the entire population of the country is directly or indirectly engaged with Hilsa fishing. Hilsa has a wide geographical distribution in Asia from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. Particularly large stocks are found in Upper Bay of Bengal (BoB) region sustained by the large river systems. The global Hilsa catch is reported 75 % from Bangladesh water, 15 % from Myanmar, 5 % from India and 5 % from other countries such as Thailand and Iran. Hilsa is a highly migratory and anadromous fish with the same migratory and same breeding behavior as that of Atlantic Salmon fish (Salmo sp.). Due to various anthropogenic activities, climate change effect, increased siltation and rising of the river basins, the migratory routes as well as spawning grounds of Hilsa are disturbed, displaced or even destroyed. During last two decades hilsa production from inland water declined about 20 %, whereas marine water yield increased about 3 times. Major Hilsa to catch has been gradually shifted from inland to marine water. <b>Hilsa</b> <b>fish</b> ascend for spawning migration from sea into estuaries. It has been found that the major spawning areas have been shifted to the lower estuarine regions of Hatia, Sandwip and Bhola. At the spawning ground of Hilsa, the fishing level F= 1. 36 yr− 1, where in the river Meghna the Fmsy= 0. 6 yr− 1 and exploitation rate E= 0. 70 is (Emsy> 0. 5). Oceanographic changes viz. high turbidity increased flooding, more tidal action and changes of salinity etc. have accelerated the change of migration patterns of spawning, growth and its production. Hilsa fecundity ranges from 1. 5 to 2. 0 million eggs for fish ranging in length from 35 to 50 cm. Hilsa fecundity is declining in different areas due to climate change and the declining fecundity impacting greatly on Hilsa production. Due to shifting of the spawning ground at the lower zone, the survival rate of juvenile Hilsa is seriously affected...|$|E
