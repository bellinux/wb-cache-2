5|$|Young birds {{indulge in}} play fighting, and one bird will often lock {{the neck of}} another under its chin. The kakapo <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> by nature and {{has been known to}} {{interact}} with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E

6000|$|And I say to mankind, <b>Be</b> not <b>curious</b> about God, [...] For I who <b>am</b> <b>curious</b> {{about each}} <b>am</b> not <b>curious</b> about God, [...] (No array of terms can {{say how much}} I am at peace about God and [...] about death.) ...|$|R

5|$|With Craig's help, the Doctor {{enters the}} store after hours and catches a Cybermat, {{which has been}} {{siphoning}} small amounts of energy to the spacecraft. The Doctor also encounters a malfunctioning Cyberman in the building's basement, and <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> how it arrived in the store. At Craig's house, while the two are distracted, the Cybermat reactivates, but {{they are able to}} stop it, and the Doctor reprograms the unit to track down the Cybermen signal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> to {{note that}} in 1881 the then Minister at Westwood, Br H Reichel, had {{recommended}} Royton to the Lancashire District Conference {{as a place where}} a new congregation might be started.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> Denis reflected, {{the way the}} Infinite {{sometimes}} repeated itself.|$|R

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> to {{find one}} of the 3 chief was with Muslim name, Mahmud. Before 1640, the Oirats had been {{wavering}} between the two faiths, Islam and Buddhism. Both these creeds had supporters among the pagan Oirats.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Woman Seated, it <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> that {{he posed}} Sien {{in a dress}} {{identical}} to one worn by Kee Vos Stricker, as can be verified by the photograph of Kee Vos and her son catalogued in the Dutch national archive Geheugen van Nederland and held {{in the collection of}} the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (reproduced top left).|$|E
25|$|Altruism: The {{argument}} for altruism is limited {{as an explanation}} because though some exists, the programmers do not focus their kindness on more charitable causes. If the generosity of working for free was a viable motivation for such a prevalent movement, it <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> why such a trend {{has not been seen}} in industries such as biotechnology that would have a much bigger impact on the public good.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} <b>are</b> <b>curious,</b> the chart below shows numeral {{values up to}} 900,000.|$|R

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{biography}} of {{the author of the}} Book of Malachi, although {{it has been suggested that}} he may have been Levitical (which <b>is</b> <b>curious,</b> considering that Ezra was a priest). The books of Zechariah and Haggai were written during the lifetime of Ezra (see 5:1); perhaps this may explain the similarities in style. Although the Ezra theory is disputed, it remains the dominant authorship theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{blind man}} wants to know: “What {{does it all}} look like now?” He <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> about the {{condition}} of the trees and several times brings up the subject of light. In the past {{he had been able to}} “feel twilight gather” but something has changed and he’s no longer as sure as he once was. It appears that these two have been abandoned or forgotten when the populous fled the area. Sometimes he thinks he hears people and wonders if they are coming back.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi has {{discovered}} {{at least five}} vélocipède races in France which predate St Cloud, so the blue plaque on the railings proclaiming Moore as winner of the first vélocipède race organised in France is incorrect {{on more than one}} count. True these races did not get the publicity that the Michaux organisation was able to attract for St-Cloud but it <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> why it should be James Moore's name on the plaque rather than Edward-Charles Bon, winner of the earlier 2.30 race or even Poloni , winner of the Grande Course that day.|$|E

25|$|Maometto {{and his men}} {{enter the}} city, which he seems to know well. Selim <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> as to why, but his general reveals nothing. Then {{soldiers}} rush in and announce that Erisso and Calbo have been captured. Both men are led in, in chains. Maometto recognizes their gallantry, but demands that they and their men surrender and states that then all will be released. By his silence, Erisso rejects the offer and, as the two {{are about to be}} led away to be tortured, Anna and the women appear from the church.|$|E
25|$|Max Ernst studied {{philosophy}} and psychology in Bonn and {{was interested in}} the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings, such as Murdering Airplane (1920), may have been inspired by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a castration complex. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription {{on the back of the}} painting reads: The picture <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E
60|$|Curious for Odd, or Singular. To <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> <b>is</b> {{to have an}} inquiring mind, or mood--curiosity.|$|R

25|$|With this iniquity of the Romans Salvian {{contrasts}} the chastity of the Vandals, the piety of the Goths, and the ruder {{virtues of}} the Franks, the Saxons, and the other tribes to whom, though heretic Arians or unbelievers, God is giving in reward the inheritance of the empire (vii. 9, II, 21). It <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> that Salvian shows no such hatred of the heterodox barbarians as was rife in Gaul seventy years later. It is difficult to credit the universal wickedness adduced by Salvian, especially in face of the contemporary testimony of Symmachus, Ausonius and Sidonius.|$|E
25|$|Stacey {{talks to}} Sean over video chat, {{and he tells}} her to look after a key. Stacey is worried about Kat and Alfie leaving, {{following}} their lottery win. She is roughed up by Dean, who asks her about his daughter with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar). Shabnam's on-off boyfriend Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) rescues her; they kiss and she tells him that Shabnam had a daughter she abandoned. Kush's friend, Martin Fowler (James Bye) becomes her flatmate. Martin and Stacey date briefly before she realises she has feelings for Kush, despite his engagement to Shabnam. They kiss {{for a second time}} but they regret it. Stacey is jealous when Shabnam reveals she is pregnant, and Stacey reconciles with Martin. Jean returns and reveals that she is marrying Ollie the next day. Jean sees the key and becomes angry, so Stacey <b>is</b> <b>curious</b> and tries to find what the key is for, to no avail; Jean pretends to flush the key down the toilet. Stacey discovers she is pregnant, but Martin asks her to get a termination, claiming that it is too soon in their relationship. She decides to keep the baby after a talk with Shabnam. Martin decides to stand by her.|$|E
