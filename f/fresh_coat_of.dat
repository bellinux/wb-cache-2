5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

In 1986, BCHS received a $24,500 federal grant and implemented a campaign to restore the school's image and spirit. The buildings received a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint, and parents, students and staff re-discovered the words to the fight song thanks to Mary Ann Frey, a teacher who was a 1968 graduate.

Nineteenth-century logging was traditionally a winter activity for men who spent summers working on farms.

The stadium opened in 1994. In 1997, the infield playing surface was replaced and the outfield fences was replaced with a new fence that stands 12ft high. In 2007 the stadium received a new playing surface. In 2010, the infield grass was replaced, new black padding was installed behind the backstop, a fresh halo was installed around the batting circle and the facility received a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> red paint.

On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E

50|$|The most {{striking}} and lasting of Cardinal Logue's legacies to the cathedral were, however, {{the scheme of}} mosaics he commissioned to adorn every inch of blank wall in the cathedral. Significant thought was given to how best {{to deal with the}} decoration of the walls of the building. Archbishop McGettigan had completed a scheme of painted murals and stencilling of the walls but, as a result of Armagh's damp climate, these had perished within a few years of completion. It was therefore decided to adopt a mosaic decorative scheme, the initial great cost being defrayed by the future saving on repainting a mural scheme. The material employed was Italian pottery of various colours in dice-shaped cubes with glass cubes for the gilt portions to prevent tarnishing and to give greater lustre. The sections were put together in two workshops in London and were carefully glued, face downwards, on strips of paper. These were then applied to a <b>fresh</b> <b>coating</b> <b>of</b> special cement on the walls in a manner resembling the hanging of wallpaper.|$|R

2500|$|The {{second season}} was {{shot on the}} north side of Oahu in Hawaii in the spring of 2006. Shooting took place near the filming {{location}} of Lost; the cast and crew of the two shows socialized during the shoot. The change in locale and obvious change in sets was for the most part ignored within the series, though actress Tracy Scoggins was given a line about [...] "what a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint can really do." [...] Behind the scenes, however, the change led to shifts in the shooting schedule, notably changes in the number of night scenes filmed because of curfew issues and restrictions imposed. The season was shot entirely on high definition videotape. It was originally intended to be six one-hour episodes, but episodes five and six were condensed into a single one. The season aired in the fall of 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reception}} of iOS 7 was mixed. Mark Rogowsky of Forbes criticized multiple {{aspects of the}} new design, including the 3D effect on the home screen wallpaper, writing that [...] "the interaction between iOS 7 and the screen background is challenging at best", and writing that the new overall design language for the operating system [...] "now has your icons fly into the screen whenever you unlock it {{like some kind of}} videogame effect. It's pointless, delays your access to the phone by {{a fraction of a second}} and is arguably distracting". Joshua Topolsky of The Verge also criticized the design, noting lack of icon consistency in different parts of the OS, as well as writing that [...] "instead of correcting issues with the notification panel and alerts, Apple has simply given them a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint and several layers of sub-navigation [...] doing nothing to actually speed up your productivity on the device." ...|$|E
50|$|Located {{on middle}} campus, Carney Faculty Center no longer hosts classes and is largely vacant. Rather, the {{building}} houses {{the offices of}} the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank,' the building is distinct from the quad area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain {{in the middle of the}} courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10 year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, <b>fresh</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30-50 year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quad.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{readings}} that piqued our interest this week: 1. In a New York Times story, Howard French {{takes a look}} at the ongoing preparations in Shanghai as next year’s World Expo grows closer. In addition to Expo-related construction in the city center, French notes, attention is also being paid to outlying neighborhoods, which are being spruced up in anticipation that some Expo-goers will want to explore Shanghai’s innumerable side streets and alleyways: Shiny new aluminum facades are being hastily stapled onto grubby family storefronts, and <b>fresh</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> paint and mortar are being applied, often for the first time in decades. This Potemkin salubrity is regarded with frank skepticism by many locals as a gigantic, government-run “face operation. ” Its aim, they say, is to impress foreign visitors, even those who wander off the beaten path, with Chinese living standards. Shanghai authorities are seeking to achieve more than just cosmetic changes, however; like Beijing did prior to the Olympics, Shanghai is also exhorting its citizens to become more “civilized” before the Expo begins. 2. It’s the height of shui mi tao, or water honey peach–“The Best Peach on Earth”— season in China, but American consumers can’t enjoy any of these delicious treats, as Stan Sesser writes at the Wall Street Journal. U. S. markets prize long shelf life and durability in the produce they sell, and the honey peach is a delicate fruit that quickly turns rotten, so it cannot survive the long journey to American tables. The honey peach isn’t especially attractive, either, which is a further strike against it in the U. S., where fruit is bred to have a vibrant exterior color that pleases the shopper’s eye. Because of all these factors, Growing honey peaches on U. S. farms isn’t practical, either. “It can be done, but it would be very time-consuming,” says [Al Courchesne, a farm owner in California], speaking of Agriculture Department regulations that require quarantine of imported fruit trees. To prevent the arrival of agricultural viruses, the USDA requires a period of isolation that could last several years, he says. When that period was over, growers would have trees bearing an ugly-looking fruit so delicate it would require special handling and rapid-fire distribution...|$|R
5000|$|For example, Rhye's and Fall of Civilization {{was called}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{exciting}} and robust mods you'll ever see for any game" [...] in Yahoo! Games review, and [...] "a <b>fresh</b> new <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> paint to the core Civilization gameplay" [...] in the Gamespot one. French magazine Cyberstratège reckoned it the best of the scenarios released in Beyond the Sword, assigning the best mark (9 of out 10) among them. Whereas the standard, epic game takes historical civilizations from different eras and locations on the planet and starts them each in 4000 BC on a random map, Rhye's and Fall of Civilization puts the civilizations into their proper time and place in human history. The mod is also notable for the addition of features meant to enhance the historical feel of the game such as a stability system (civs truly can rise and fall), plagues, historical place names, and scripted AI behavior that mirrors real Earth history. An added victory condition, the Historical Victory is also added. This victory requires the player to meet certain conditions that are unique to each civilization, for example the Americans must not allow European cities in North America by 1900 and Arabia must spread Islam to 30% of the world in order to win.|$|R

60|$|I {{have lived}} a {{severely}} moral life. But {{it would be}} a mistake for other people to try that, or for me to recommend it. Very few would succeed: you have to have a perfectly colossal stock of morals; and you can't get them on a margin; you have to have the whole thing, and put them in your box. Morals are an acquirement--like music, like a foreign language, like piety, poker, paralysis--no man is born with them. I wasn't myself, I started poor. I hadn't a single moral. There is hardly a man in this house that is poorer than I was then. Yes, I started like that--the world before me, not a moral in the slot. Not even an insurance moral. I can remember the first one I ever got. I can remember the landscape, the weather, the--I can remember how everything looked. It was an old moral, an old second-hand moral, all out of repair, and didn't fit, anyway. But if you are careful with a thing like that, and keep it in a dry place, and save it for processions, and Chautauquas, and World's Fairs, and so on, and disinfect it now and then, and give it a <b>fresh</b> <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> whitewash once in a while, you will be surprised to see how well she will last and how long she will keep sweet, or at least inoffensive. When I got that mouldy old moral, she had stopped growing, because she hadn't any exercise; but I worked her hard, I worked her Sundays and all. Under this cultivation she waxed in might and stature beyond belief, and served me well and was my pride and joy for sixty-three years; then she got to associating with insurance presidents, and lost flesh and character, and was a sorrow to look at and no longer competent for business. She was a great loss to me. Yet not all loss. I sold her--ah, pathetic skeleton, as she was--I sold her to Leopold, the pirate King of Belgium; he sold her to our Metropolitan Museum, and it was very glad to get her, for without a rag on, she stands 57 feet long and 16 feet high, and they think she's a brontosaur.
