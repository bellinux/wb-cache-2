5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, Panufnik visited Soviet Union {{as part of}} a Polish {{delegation}} to study Soviet teaching methods. [...] He met Dmitri Shostakovich, whom he had befriended at previous conferences, and Aram Khachaturian. During conversations with lesser composers, Panufnik was pressed to say what he was working on. <b>Having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something acceptable, he casually mentioned that he had an idea for a Symphony of Peace. This was seized upon, and on returning to Poland he was granted a stay in quiet surroundings so that he could finish the piece (Panufnik interpreted this as an order to complete it). He wrote a three movement work, ending with a setting of words by his friend, the poet Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. Panufnik hoped to work his own conception of peace into the composition, rather than the official Soviet ideology. The piece was not a success with the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|The di Marcos {{remained}} {{with the show}} as a unit until 2000, when the new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull {{the majority of the}} family. All except Beppe (Michael Greco) and his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou) were written out. They were reportedly [...] "slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them". A source allegedly told The Mirror: [...] "It's always unpleasant <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to people who have given loyal service to the show for a number of years. But John Yorke feels it's time to make his mark on the show. Every new producer likes to do the same. John wants to introduce a new family later this year and felt the Di Marcos had nowhere else to go. Their storylines were beginning to feel tired and that's a good time to make such a drastic change...There is a lot of sympathy for actress Louise Jameson because her character was two-dimensional from the start. Nagging, moaning mums are not viewer-friendly. There was nothing sexy or appealing about Rosa through no fault of Louise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casali's {{obituary}} {{published in}} The Times related that {{after she and}} Roberto became engaged, Casali {{took a job as}} a receptionist for a design company, [...] "and made up little booklets of her winsome cartoons, which she sold for a dollar apiece. Word soon spread and the demand for Love is... escalated. Roberto recognised their commercial potential and showed them to an American journalist." [...] Although other sources differ regarding whether it was Roberto or Casali herself who first showed the cartoons to an acquaintance working for the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper picked them up for publication and published the first of the series on 5 January 1970, under the pen name [...] "Kim". The cartoon's release coincided with the wave of success of the novel Love Story (1970) by Erich Segal, and the subsequent movie of the same name starring Ali MacGraw as a girl dying of an incurable disease and Ryan O'Neal as the student who worshiped her. The film's slogan was [...] "Love means never <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you're sorry." [...] Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: [...] "Love is... being able to say you're sorry." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} test variants {{commonly used in}} clinical settings, with differences between them {{in the number of}} subtasks, type and number of stimulus, times for the task, or scoring procedures. All versions have at least two numbers of subtasks. In the first trial, the written color name differs from the color ink it is printed in, and the participant must say the written word. In the second trial, the participant must name the ink color instead. However, there can be up to four different subtasks, adding in some cases stimuli consisting of groups of letters [...] "X" [...] or dots printed in a given color with the participant <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the color of the ink; or names of colors printed in black ink that have to be read. The number of stimuli varies between fewer than twenty items to more than 150, being closely related to the scoring system used. While in some test variants the score is the number of items from a subtask read in a given time, in others it is the time that it took to complete each of the trials. The number of errors and different derived punctuations are also taken into account in some versions.|$|E

6000|$|He had forgotten, and {{was even}} more {{surprised}} than ashamed. But the great thing was that he saw in this no vulgar reminder of any [...] "sweet" [...] speech.
