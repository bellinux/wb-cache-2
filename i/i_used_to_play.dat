500|$|Willis {{was born}} in Sunderland, County Durham, {{and grew up in}} the Surrey village of Stoke d'Abernon near Cobham, having moved there at the age of six. His father was an {{employee}} of the BBC, and Willis had an elder brother named David with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister. In 1965, Willis added his third name [...] "Dylan" [...] by deed poll in honour of American musician Bob Dylan, of whom he is a fan. Willis was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, playing [...] his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became Vice President and Life Member, and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians. He was also an avid schoolboy footballer, but was not a natural athlete and loathed rugby, which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years [...] "in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> football with the school old boys. This taught me how to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons." [...] Willis' bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts, under the directorship of Watcyn Evans, who would become a close friend.|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the game during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned {{the rules of the}} game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You {{have to know how to}} hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had to make sure they were able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E

[...] Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet Royston Ellis at the Mermaid Theatre between 1960–61, and singer Red E. Lewis, he was asked by singer Neil Christian to join his band, the Crusaders, after Christian had seen a fifteen-year-old Page playing in a local hall.

Pippen had spent the winter working out in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and announced that he was hoping for a late-season return to the league. Dwyane Wade, who was the Finals MVP of the 2006 NBA Finals and the captain of the returning champions, the Miami Heat, liked the idea of Pippen making a comeback and expressed his views on it: [...] "I'm already playing with [...] Payton and Shaq, two guys <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with on video games.

Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously.

It induced feelings of light-headedness and dizziness followed by temporary unconsciousness (usually lasting 10 to 15 seconds). I did it twice and on both occasions I felt as though I had lived a whole other life while I was unconscious.

Do you know, I can never go up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver? There was one especially horrifying phantom which we created--the ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours. I confess that, to this day, I cannot help fancying its little, furtive footsteps behind me when I come here after nightfall. I'm not afraid of the White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons, but I wish I had never imagined that baby's ghost into existence. How angry Marilla and Mrs. Barry were over that affair," [...] concluded Anne, with reminiscent laughter.|$|R

The album's sound homed {{in on the}} Appalachian [...] "high lonesome" [...] influences evident on Prine's eponymous debut LP and its bluegrass instrumentation reflects Prine's fascination with early American folk and country music. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and features Prine's brother Dave on dobro, banjo, and fiddle while Steve Goodman also contributes on guitar and harmonies. In the Great Days: The John Prine Anthology liner notes, Prine tells David Fricke that the album {{was recorded}} in three days {{at a cost of}} $7,200, [...] "including beer", and adds [...] "I just wanted to do Diamonds the way <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>playing</b> music at my house with Dave and Steve.

O! saith the child, pray do not hurt me: I then have replied, Canst thou do nothing with this finger? No, saith the child, nor with this hand either; then have I said, Shall we cut off this finger, and buy my child a better, a brave golden finger?

Then have I begun <b>to</b> make some <b>use</b> of that good sermon which this little child has preached unto me; and thus have I gone on. If membership be so dear, if this child has such tenderness to the most infirm, the most useless of its members; if it counts me its friend no longer than when I have a mouth to bemoan and carriages that show tenderness to this useless finger; what an interest doth membership give on in the body, and what compassions hath the soul for such an useless thing, because it is a member! and turning all this over to Jesus Christ, then instead of matter and corruption, there presently comes honey to me out of this child's sore finger; I take leave to tell you now how <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> And though <b>I</b> have told this tale upon so grave a truth, as is the membership of Christians with their head, yet bear with me; no child can be so tender of its sore finger as is the Son of God of his afflicted members; he cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.[31] ...|$|R
