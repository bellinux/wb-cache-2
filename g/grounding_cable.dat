40|$|Vibration {{measurement}} {{has been}} adopted in some utilities in Australia, Canada and several European countries for online condition monitoring of power transformer’s On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC). By comparing measured vibration signals at different stages, {{it might be possible}} to assess changes of OLTC’s condition. However, there are still considerable difficulties in correlating vibration signals to events of OLTC operation, which may impair the capability of vibration measurement for OLTC condition monitoring. Therefore, arcing measurement is proposed in this paper to complement to vibration measurement. Arcing is provoked when OLTC switching contact closes at a fixed tap position and it can lead to electromagnetic signals flowing through transformer windings and finally reaches earth. The arcing measurement is achieved by using a High Frequency Current Transducer (HFCT) clamping on the transformer’s <b>grounding</b> <b>cable.</b> The joint vibration and arcing measurement can provide a better means for interpreting events involved in OLTC operation and facilitating an improved OLTC condition monitoring. Since HFCT measured arcing signals can be coupled with noise, a probabilistic wavelet transform is thus employed in this paper to extract arcing signals from noise. Field measurements on two different types of OLTCs are performed using the joint vibration and arcing measurement system to validate the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{represents}} two methodologies for calculating lightning discharge process, {{which is}} the basis for comparing two different software products. The tower surge impedance is deeply related to geometric shapes. However, due to the existence of complex transmission line structures, computing surge impedance is not easy. Besides, due to variety of structures of different shapes and sizes, a general equation encompassing all cases is impossible. In this way, equations obtained from simple geometric shapes, such as cylinders and cones, representing various types of towers, were developed [3]. Tower could be represented as inductance connecting shield wires to ground, constant-impedance transmission line, variable-impedance transmission line, or radiating structure. With adequate approximation, travel time can be represented as t=h/c, where t[s] is time, h[m] is tower height and c[m/s] is speed of light. Many experimental and theoretical studies of tower response have been initiated. Scientists Wagner and Hileman found the transient impedance of a cylinder to an impressed surge {{at the top of the}} tower. Sargent and Darveniza noted that a cone has constant transient impedance and derived average impedance of cylinder. Chisholm, Chow and Srivastava found that impedance depends on direction of injection, with vertical injection to cylinders and cones agreeing with and horizontal injection matching experiments using this geometry [3, 4]. The analysis of lightning performance is fundamental when designing new lines and for uprating existing lines to higher voltages. There are a number of issues in creation of approximate model of lightning discharge into power line tower; towers have not uniform structure and different dimensions and geometry. This paper describes process of power line’s tower model creation for further modelling using software on electromagnetic transient program. The amplitude of the lightning current and its impact place is one of the main characteristics of the lightning discharge. Traditional remedy of lightning protections (ground wire) do not always protect phase conductors against lightning strikes. When lightning strikes in the <b>grounding</b> <b>cable</b> their performance is heavily dependent on HV tower’s ground resistance. The lightning-proof assessing calculations of lightning’s currents amplitude must be adjusted according to the equivalent resistance of the stroked object (ground wire, badly grounded ground wire or overhead tower) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} electric-arc {{welding process}} has been developed for manufacturing high-quality batches of carbon nanotubes at relatively low cost. Unlike in some other processes for making carbon nanotubes, metal catalysts are not used and, consequently, {{it is not necessary}} to perform extensive cleaning and purification. Also, unlike some other processes, this process is carried out at atmospheric pressure under a hood instead of in a closed, pressurized chamber; as a result, the present process can be implemented more easily. Although the present welding-based process includes an electric arc, it differs from a prior electric-arc nanotube-production process. The welding equipment used in this process includes an AC/DC welding power source with an integral helium-gas delivery system and circulating water for cooling an assembly that holds one of the welding electrodes (in this case, the anode). The cathode is a hollow carbon (optionally, graphite) rod having an outside diameter of 2 in. (approximately equal to 5. 1 cm) and an inside diameter of 5 / 8 in. (approximately equal to 1. 6 cm). The cathode is partly immersed in a water bath, such that it protrudes about 2 in. (about 5. 1 cm) above the surface of the water. The bottom end of the cathode is held underwater by a clamp, to which is connected the <b>grounding</b> <b>cable</b> of the welding power source. The anode is a carbon rod 1 / 8 in. (approximately equal to 0. 3 cm) in diameter. The assembly that holds the anode includes a thumbknob- driven mechanism for controlling the height of the anode. A small hood is placed over the anode to direct a flow of helium downward from the anode to the cathode during the welding process. A bell-shaped exhaust hood collects the helium and other gases from the process. During the process, as the anode is consumed, the height of the anode is adjusted to maintain an anode-to-cathode gap of 1 mm. The arc-welding process is continued until the upper end of the anode has been lowered to a specified height above the surface of the water bath. The process causes carbon nanotubes to form in the lowest 2. 5 cm of the anode. It also causes a deposit reminiscent of a sandcastle to form on the cathode. The nanotube-containing material is harvested. The cathode and anode can then be cleaned (or the anode is replaced, if necessary) and the process repeated to produce more nanotubes. Tests have shown that the process results in approximately equal to 50 -percent yield of carbon nanotubes (mostly of the single-wall type) of various sizes. Whereas the unit cost of purified single-wall carbon nanotubes produced by other process is about $ 1, 000 /g in the year 2000, it has been estimated that for the present process, the corresponding cost would be about $ 10 /g...|$|E

Forward Parties of the 15th Durham Light Infantry, under Captain Arthur Moore Lacelles VC, along with Ablitt and a forward Signals maintenance party from Division, then crossed the railway lines and advanced to Limont-Fontaine.
