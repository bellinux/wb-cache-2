He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the Afghan people.|$|E

There are exceptions to the lunar day rule; special days are allotted for people {{who died in a}} particular manner or had a certain status in life. Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the Saudi {{government}} began to slowly step up a public education campaign about AIDS-HIV. It started to recognize World AIDS Day, and the Arabic and English daily newspapers {{were permitted to}} run articles and opinions that expressed {{the need for more}} education about the disease and more compassion <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> infected. The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret, as the official policy was often that the disease was not a serious problem in a kingdom because Saudis followed the principles of traditional Islamic morality.|$|E

These prisons include common criminals, but also many political prisoners. The vast majority of inmates are victims of arbitrary detention and imprisonment without due process and fair trial guarantees. Torture, rape, excessive forced labor, and other arbitrary cruelties at the hands of guards and fellow prisoners are widespread and committed with impunity. Prisoners are still recognized as citizens and retain some rights. Their incarceration terms are typically not for life, and family visits are possible.|$|E

25|$|Because enamel is {{vulnerable}} to demineralization, prevention of tooth decay {{is the best way}} to maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of toothbrushes, which can reduce the number of dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that do not have access to toothbrushes, it is common <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor toothbrushes can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Genetic variations, in humans, might contribute to the intrinsic structural integrity of the enamel, and to its predisposition to demineralization or attack from bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, the Ministry of Health {{publicly}} {{admitted that}} more than 10,000 Saudi citizens were either infected with HIV or had AIDS. In December 2006 the Arab News ran an editorial that called for greater public awareness of how the virus is spread and more compassion <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> infected. In the same year, a Saudi citizen named Rami al-Harithi revealed that he had become infected with HIV while having surgery and has become an official proponent of education and showing compassion to those people infected. Saudi Princess Alia bint Abdullah {{has been involved in}} the Saudi AIDS Society, which was permitted in December 2006 to hold a public charity art auction followed by a discussion on how the disease was impacting the kingdom that included two Saudis living with HIV. The event was organized {{with the help of the}} Saudi National Program for Combating AIDS which is chaired by Dr. Sana Filimban.|$|E
25|$|The 45rpm discs {{also came}} in a variety known as {{extended}} play (EP), which achieved up to 10â€“15 minutes play {{at the expense of}} attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who had only 45rpm players. LP albums could be purchased one EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with three EPs or twelve items. The large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959. The EP lasted considerably longer in Europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as Serge Gainsbourg and the Beatles.|$|E

500|$|Wendy Davis of Online Media Daily {{commented on}} the {{potential}} impact of the case, and observed it was a victory for proponents of Internet rights.

[...] John Cook of Gawker called Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain name over to Beck an optimal end to the affair which emphasized the ridiculousness of Beck's actions.

In 1970, with about 100 patients, they approached the Rotary Club for funds. The Rotary Club agreed to finance the home on condition that the club take over the running of it. The sisters handed the deeds over to the Society for the Aged Sick, an association formed by the Rotary Club members. The society built three blocks to house the increasing number of residents and Hsu remained the home's matron until 1980, when she was asked to retire at 83. Hsu moved into a three-room apartment on the rooftop of the Home, built by the society. After her sister died, she left Hsu a sum of money which she was able to buy flats withâ€”five in Singapore and two in Malaysia <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who had no money and who were asked to move.
