While not malignant, the tumor exerts pressure on certain motor <b>functions,</b> <b>resulting</b> in temporary memory loss, loss of vision and slurring of speech. She decided against elective surgery because the surgery would alter her nasal cavity and permanently modify her voice. To facilitate her care, she announced in April 2011 {{that she had been}} prohibited from taking on new voice acting roles in anime since some time the previous year. She still continued voicing characters for anime that received additional seasons or extended runs. In May 2011, Hirano announced via Twitter that she was no longer performing music for Lantis and has discontinued her music career until further notice. On August 2, 2011, Japanese magazine Bubka confirmed that Hirano was dismissed by Lantis due to a sex scandal involving her sleeping with several band members. Citing a need for a new agency that was more ideal with her career wishes, Hirano announced on August 12, 2011 that she left Space Craft Entertainment. On August 21, Hirano moved to the voice acting agency Grick. Days later, on August 27, Hirano posted {{a message on}} her Twitter account, confirming that she has resumed new voice acting roles in anime.|$|E

He is a former prodigy that is the son-like protégé of Hank Pym, a sibling-like relationship with Hope van Dyne, and a nemesis of Scott Lang. Cross pushes Pym out of his mentor's namesake company and takes over as CEO, stemming from an obsession with duplicating Pym's original Ant-Man shrinking technology. Cross attempts this with his Yellowjacket suit despite his imperfect shrinking technology, which slowly drives him mad as it alters his brain's chemistry. While {{trying to sell the}} Yellowjacket suit to Mitchell Carson's HYDRA faction and the Ten Rings, Cross has a confrontation with Scott, resulting in Cross donning the Yellowjacket suit to stop the new Ant-Man. When Scott and Hank completely destroy Pym Technologies' work, Yellowjacket tries to exact revenge by threatening Scott's daughter. But Scott stops him by shrinking into the Yellowjacket suit and messing with its <b>functions,</b> <b>resulting</b> in Cross shrinking uncontrollably.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Lee Smolin {{suggested}} that the Kodama state is a ground state which has a good semiclassical limit which reproduces the dynamics of general relativity with a positive (de Sitter) cosmological constant, 4 dimensions, and gravitons. It is an exact solution to ordinary constraints on background independent quantum gravity, providing evidence that loop quantum gravity is indeed a quantum gravity with the correct semiclassical description. [...] In 2003, Edward Witten published a paper in response to Lee Smolin's, arguing that the Kodama state is unphysical, due to an analogy to a state in Chern-Simons theory wave <b>functions,</b> <b>resulting</b> in negative energies. In 2006, Andrew Randono published two papers which address these objections, by generalizing the Kodama state. Randono concluded that the Immirzi parameter, when generalized with a real value, fixed by matching with black hole entropy, describes parity violation in quantum gravity, and is CPT invariant, and is normalizable, and chiral, consistent with known observations of both gravity and quantum field theory. Randono claims that Witten's conclusions rest on the Immirzi parameter taking on an imaginary number, which simplifies the equation. The physical inner product may resemble the MacDowell-Mansouri action formulation of gravity.|$|E

5000|$|An exciton {{can form}} when a photon is absorbed by a semiconductor. [...] This excites an {{electron}} from the valence band into the conduction band. In turn, this leaves behind a positively charged electron hole (an abstraction for the location from which an electron was moved). The electron in the conduction band is then effectively attracted to this localized hole by the repulsive Coulomb forces from {{large numbers of}} electrons surrounding the hole and excited electron. This attraction provides a stabilizing energy balance. Consequently, the exciton has slightly less energy than the unbound electron and hole. The wavefunction of the bound state {{is said to be}} hydrogenic, an exotic atom state akin to that of a hydrogen atom. However, the binding energy is much smaller and the particle's size much larger than a hydrogen atom. This is because of both the screening of the Coulomb force by other electrons in the semiconductor (i.e., its dielectric constant), and the small effective masses of the excited electron and hole. The recombination of the electron and hole, i.e. the decay of the exciton, is limited by resonance stabilization due to the overlap of the electron and hole wave <b>functions,</b> <b>resulting</b> in an extended lifetime for the exciton.|$|E

50|$|In {{coordination}} with the molecules and pathways discussed, epigenetic mechanisms {{play a role}} in the development of alcoholism. These mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, and (microRNA miRNA) action. Methylation of the DNA typically occurs at CpG sites, or a cysteine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotide in the 5’ to 3’ direction. These sites are common promoter and regulatory elements in mammals and methylation of cysteine residues typically inhibits these <b>functions</b> <b>resulting</b> in the repression of gene expression. DNA methylation is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are recruited to CpG sites by methyl-DNA binding proteins, such as MeCP2. Next, histones can be modified in several ways to increase or decrease gene expression. Histones are protein complexes used to package DNA into structures known as nucleosomes. The level of coiling of the DNA around histones is variable and influences transcription levels. Tight coiling, or heterochromatin, is associated with low gene expression or even silencing. Loose coiling, or euchromatin, is associated with higher levels of gene expression. Typically, acetylation of histones is associated with euchromatin formation. Acetyl groups are added by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CBP. In opposition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups, typically leading to the formation of heterochromatin. HDACs are recruited by scaffolding proteins, such as RACK 1. HDAC inhibitors prevent HDAC functioning which promotes gene expression. Histone methylation, adding a methyl group to specific histone protein amino acids, can both increase or decrease gene expression depending on the histone protein, amino acid, and number of methyl groups used. Gene expression can also be inhibited post-transcriptionally by miRNA, double-stranded RNA, typically formed from hairpin structures, that is used to inhibit translation of proteins. After processing by the RNA interference (RNAi) molecules Drosha and Dicer, a single, guide-strand is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is used to bind mRNA. This binding suppresses protein synthesis and sometimes initiates mRNA degradation.|$|E
