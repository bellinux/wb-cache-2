Zorin's horse wins a race but proves <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, {{believes}} that Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes after being chased by Bond.|$|E

5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E

Though rare, {{multiple}} vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.|$|E

25|$|Paul Francis Gadd {{was born}} on 8 May 1944 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England. His mother, a cleaner, was unmarried, and {{initially}} brought him up {{with the help of}} her mother; he never knew his father. He was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and at the age of 10, along with his brother, he was taken into local authority care. Although nominally a Protestant, he was educated at a Roman Catholic school. He frequently ran away to London, to the clubs that were to be the launching ground of his career.|$|E
25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} {{are required to}} get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of the}} charge transporting layers but is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.|$|E
25|$|Eurocom ported a {{compressed}} and scaled down {{version for}} the Game Boy. It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What The Heck? is missing.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{excessive}} pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a release valve was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories switched off the machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and the supply of pressurized water was difficult {{to adapt to the}} real demand. The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated {{for the sole purpose of}} a tourist attraction without any other function.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} method {{follows the}} first steps of the traditional method in that after primary fermentation the cuvée is transferred to bottles to complete secondary fermentation, which allows for additional complexity. When the secondary fermentation is complete and the wine has spent the desired {{amount of time in}} bottle on yeast lees (six months is the requirement to label a wine 'bottle fermented') then the individual bottles are transferred (hence the name) into a larger tank. The wine is then filtered, liqueur de dosage added, and then filled back into new bottles for sale. This method allows for complexity to be built into the wine, but also gives scope for blending options after the wine has gone into bottle and reduces the bottle-to-bottle variations that can be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> in the traditional method.|$|E
25|$|These ants are not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> {{and most}} ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as}} the problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E

25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that made it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> In the mix of fog and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it and nowhere to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found {{an hour or two}} later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
25|$|The LaGG-3 rapidly {{replaced}} the LaGG-1, although the new fighter {{was too heavy}} for its engine. In fact, Lavochkin, Gorbunov and Gudkov had originally designed their prototype for the powerful Klimov M-106 engine, but {{it proved to be}} unreliable, so they were obliged to install the relatively weak Klimov M-105P. As a result, the LaGG was slow; its top speed was just 575km/h, while its rate of climb, at ground level, was as slow as 8.5 meters/second. The LaGG-3 proved to be somewhat <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> as it reacted sluggishly to stick forces. In particular, it was difficult to pull out of a dive, and if the stick was pulled too hard, it tended to fall into a spin. As a consequence, sharp turns were difficult to perform. A more powerful version of the engine was installed, but the improvement was small, so the only solution was to lighten the airframe. The LaGG team re-examined the design and pared down the structure as much as possible. Automatic slats were added to the wings to improve climb and maneuverability and further weight was saved by installing lighter armament (most versions used a 20mm ShVAK cannon and a single synchronized 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine gun). But the improvement was slight and, thus, without an alternative powerplant, when the LaGG-3 was first committed to combat in July 1941, it was completely outclassed by the Messerschmitt Bf 109.|$|E
50|$|Xpand Rally has {{approximately}} 60 tracks {{from different}} parts of the world. Races take place in the deserts, lakes, green forests and mountains.

25|$|High {{levels of}} {{population}} dispersion and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the presence of mountainous terrain, increased the chance of conflict. Both of these factors favor rebels, as a population dispersed outward toward the borders is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> than one concentrated in a central region, while mountains offer terrain where rebels can seek sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of deploying {{a group of}} robots to an area and engaging enemy forces. Both sides will typically {{have a number of}} robots and a base to protect. Damaged robots can return to the base for repairs. As robots take damage they will become <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and use as various systems fail.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to sexual reproduction, the tree cholla reproduces when stem joints {{fall to the}} ground and take root. Thus this species spreads and its spread is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> especially where animals defecate seeds and carry stem joints stuck to their hide some distance from the parent plant. [...] (Some cows, [...] "cholla eaters", learn to eat cholla fruits despite the pain.) [...] "Waves of invasion" [...] typically occur four or five years after drought combined with grazing, probably because this combination exposes soil on which the stem joints can take root.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki passed Dale Jarrett with 27laps {{left at the}} Food City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take {{a narrow}} victory. It was his fourthWinston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the topfive in season points. Andrews {{attributed}} Kulwicki's consistently strong finishes to the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, [...] "It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> them, and the driver's ability to work with that car during practice {{in order to get}} the car set up meant so much more than it ever did." [...] Kulwicki's second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention. He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th.|$|E
2500|$|Smalley criticized Drexler's work on {{nanotechnology}} as naive, {{arguing that}} chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> {{and that a}} universal assembler is science fiction. [...] Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" [...] and the [...] "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.|$|E
