40|$|Several local options {{exist for}} the reconstruc-tion of defects around the knee joint 1 â€“ 4; how-ever, the success and {{versatility}} of these flaps are limited by their relatively short pedicle lengths and small size of the skin flaps. For these reasons, the reverse anterolateral thigh (ALT) has become a popular choice in the reconstruction of knee and occasionally proximal tibial defects due to its long pedicle length, large skin flap size, 5 {{and the ability to}} harvest vascularized tensor fascia lata with the flap to reconstruct the extensor mechanism of the <b>knee</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). 6 When tackling defects that extend {{to the level of the}} middle third of the tibia, however, lo-cal fasciocutaneous, muscle, or free flaps tend to be used. Indeed, this area is perceived to be beyond the arc of rotation of a reverse ALT. However, we present a case recently encountered at our institution where a reverse ALT pedicled to the mid-tibial level was suc-cessfully performed to revise a below-knee amputa-tion (BKA) stump. CASE PRESENTATION A 30 -year-old patient presented with an intractable, unstable scar over the distal aspect of his long BKA stump that was hindering his ability to wear a pros-thesis (Fig. 1). He declined tibial shortening and pre-ferred to undergo a reconstructive procedure. Plans were therefore made to debride the area of unstable scar (Fig. 2) and reconstruct with a trapezius perfora-tor flap (TPF). This option was selected as the patient wanted to avoid further scarring to either leg, and as we were planning to perform the microvascular anas-tomosis to the popliteal vessels in the lateral decubitus position, the TPF represented a flap that could be con-veniently harvested while maintaining this patient po-sition. Unfortunately, however, the TPF failed due to venous congestion secondary to postoperative pedicle compression. Indeed, given the paucity of recipient vessels and our desire to avoid another microanasto...|$|E

"It's {{the sound}} of a man running towards us," [...] she answered, and then, {{suddenly}} dropping the last semblance of self-command, she tell upon her <b>knees</b> beside the <b>table</b> and began praying aloud with that frenzied earnestness which intense, overpowering fear can produce, breaking off now and again into half-hysterical whimperings.|$|R
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} September Westover {{spent the}} night before he went back to town with them.

60|$|On this {{occasion}} it {{was assigned to}} Brother Hawkyard to pray, and to Brother Gimblet to preach. The prayer was to open the ceremonies; the discourse was to come next. Brothers Hawkyard and Gimblet were both on the platform; Brother Hawkyard on his <b>knees</b> at the <b>table,</b> unmusically ready to pray; Brother Gimblet sitting against the wall, grinningly ready to preach.|$|R
60|$|The score {{advanced}} rapidly, {{both players}} standing precisely equal. At {{the end of}} the first half-hour it stood at ten all. Throgton, a grim look upon his face, had settled down to work, playing with one <b>knee</b> on the <b>table.</b> Kent, calm but alive with excitement, leaned well forward to his stroke, his eye held within an inch of the ball.|$|R
60|$|What {{was there}} in this (I wondered) to make her turn pale? And why, after what he had just said, did I see her eyes willingly rest on him, {{for the first time}} in my experience?

Surely there was {{something}} being taught her by this experience of great need; and she must be learning a secret of human tenderness and long-suffering, that the less erring could hardly know?

"I {{went into}} the study, and found him sitting close by the fire with {{his head down and}} his hands on his <b>knees.</b> On the <b>table</b> near him, beside Armadale's letter and my note, I saw, in the little circle of light thrown by the reading-lamp, an open railway guide. Was he meditating flight? It was {{impossible}} to tell from his face, when he looked up at me, what he was meditating, or how the shock had struck him when he first discovered that Armadale was a living man.|$|R

But you got to account in all these here heredity cases for counteractin' influences. The Durgins are as good as wheat, right along, all of 'em; and I guess Mis' Durgin's mother must have been a pretty good woman too. Mis' Durgin's all right, too, if she has got a will of her own."

6000|$|She {{clasped her}} hands together, dropped on her <b>knees</b> at the <b>table</b> that stood by her, and hid her face. So she {{continued}} till she was roused {{by the sound}} of Cicely's sobs. Frightened and oppressed, and new to all terror and sorrow, the girl had followed her example in kneeling, but the very attempt to pray brought on a fit of weeping, and the endeavour to restrain what might disturb the Queen only rendered the sobs more choking and strangling, till at last Mary heard, and coming towards her, sat down on the floor, gathered her into her arms, and kissing her forehead, said, [...] "Poor bairnie, and did she weep for her mother? Have the sorrows of her house come on her?" ...|$|R

Really one might have credited Vinrace with more sense. My dear," [...] Helen was on her <b>knees</b> under a <b>table,</b> [...] "you are only making yourself untidy, and we had much better recognise {{the fact that we}} are condemned to six weeks of unspeakable misery. To come at all was the height of folly, but now that we are here I suppose that I can face it like a man. My diseases of course will be increased--I feel already worse than I did yesterday, but we've only ourselves to thank, and the children happily--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{indicate}} the methods which Bottazzi and his assistants {{brought to bear}} on the medium. No more worship here, no awe, no hesitation, no superstition. Among other things, he put into the cabinet a small table weighing about fifteen pounds, and on top of it arranged a hair-brush, a hen's feather, a bottle full of water, and a very thick glass. These articles and the table were the only objects that could be moved. His aim was to limit the spirit hands to a few movables--to see whether they could not be taught to do what was required of them. Well, that little table came out of the cabinet of its own accord in a light that made it perfectly visible, at the precise time when three of the inexorable professors were rigidly clasping the psychic. But that is not the most remarkable thing. The psychic's feet were held by the engineer, and he observed that at the exact moment when Paladino pushed against his <b>knee</b> the <b>table</b> moved. 'Each advance of the table corresponded,' says Bottazzi, 'with the most perfect synchronism, to the push of Eusapia's legs against Jona's knees'; in other words, she really executed movements identical with those that she would have made had she been pushing the table out of the cabinet with her visible limbs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fulkerson {{took the}} reply upon himself. [...] "Well, you needn't make 'em so {{bad as the}} old-style cuts; but you can make them unobtrusive, {{modestly}} retiring. We've got hold of a process something like that those French fellows gave Daudet thirty-five thousand dollars {{to write a novel}} to use with; kind of thing that begins at one side; or one corner, and spreads in a sort of dim religious style over the print till you can't tell which is which. Then we've got a notion that where the pictures don't behave quite so sociably, they can be dropped into the text, like a little casual remark, don't you know, or a comment that has some connection, or maybe none at all, with what's going on in the story. Something like this." [...] Fulkerson took away one <b>knee</b> from the <b>table</b> long enough to open the drawer, and pull from it a book that he shoved toward Beacon. [...] "That's a Spanish book I happened to see at Brentano's, and I froze to it on account of the pictures. I guess they're pretty good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blake {{is as much}} to {{be trusted}} as I am. No, I am forced to a {{practical}} acceptance {{of the theory of}} the fluidic arm, and yet this is a most astounding admission. We must suppose that the psychic was able to read our minds and write down our mingled and confused musical conceptions by means of a supernumerary hand. It happens that I have since seen these etheric hands in action, which makes it easier for me to conceive of such a process. I have seen them dart forth from another medium precisely as described by Scarpa. I have seen them lift a glass of water, and I have had them touch my <b>knees</b> beneath a <b>table</b> while slate-writing was going on--so that, given the power to read my mind, there is nothing impossible (having regard to Bottazzi's definite experiments) in the idea of the etheric hand's setting down the music and reproducing the signature of 'E. A.' In fact, at a recent sitting in a private house with a young male psychic, we had this precise feat performed. Said the psychic to our host, Dr. Towne, 'Think hard of a signature that is very familiar to you,' and Dr. Towne fixed his mind upon the signature of his brother, and immediately, while the young man's material hands were controlled, his etheric hand seized a pencil {{in the middle of the}} table and reproduced the signature." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{laughter}} {{grew more}} and mere violent. I tried to quiet him in vain. His servant and the landlord {{of the inn}} entered the room, but they only added fuel to the fire, and I made them go out again. As I shut the door on them, I observed lying on a table near at hand the packet of letters from Miss Elmslie, which my unhappy friend preserved with such care, and read and re-read with such unfailing devotion. Looking toward me just when I passed by the table, the letters caught his eye. The new hope for the future, {{in connection with the}} writer of them, which my news was already awakening in his heart, seemed to overwhelm him in an instant at sight of the treasured memorials that reminded him of his betrothed wife. His laughter ceased, his face changed, he ran to the table, caught the letters up in his hand, looked from them to me for one moment with an altered expression which went to my heart, then sank down on his <b>knees</b> at the <b>table,</b> laid his face on the letters, and burst into tears. I let the new emotion have its way uninterruptedly, and quitted the room without saying a word. When I returned after a lapse of some little time, I found him sitting quietly in his chair, reading one of the letters from the pack et which rested on his knee.|$|R
