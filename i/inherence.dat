A resident is supposed to have its influences for people health related to their health behavior and availability of basic sanitation facilities. Problem in insufficiency clean water supply can cause skin health complaints at the dormitory. The type of this research was descriptive survey. This research aimed to describe the knowledge, attitude, and actions of <b>inherences</b> about personal hygiene and basic sanitations, physical components and basic sanitation facilities, and skin health complaints of <b>inherences</b> at USU female dormitory. This research used systematic random sampling technique. There were 15 persons at old USU female dormitory and 60 persons at new USU female dormitory which were participated as samples. The result of this study showed that 73, 3 % of respondents at old USU female dormitory had good knowledge; 93, 3 % of respondents had good attitude; 93, 3 % of respondents had good actions about personal hygiene and basic sanitation. There were 73, 3 % of respondents at new USU female dormitory had good knowledge; 93, 3 % of respondents had good attitude; 80, 0 % of respondents had good actions about personal hygiene and basic sanitation. Percentage of respondents whose skin health complaints were 60, 0 % at old USU female dormitory and 78, 3 % at new USU female dormitory. All physical components in USU female dormitory had already met the health requirements but the basic sanitation facilities had not. The manager of dormitory was expected to give more concern to serve basic sanitation facilities which meet the health requirements, especially in supplying clean water which wass sufficient in quantity, continuality, and quality. It was expected to the inhabitants to keep personal hygiene and to use basic sanitation facility well to avoid skin diseases and for those who had skin health complaints to have medical treatment...|$|R

It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to paramāṇu (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and <b>inherence.</b> According to Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience.|$|E

He therefore underlines {{the fact that there is}} an <b>inherence</b> of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account.

40|$|Pedestal {{looseness}} and rub-impact are {{two important}} faults in rotating machinery. Once the Pedestal looseness is {{developed in a}} rotor system, the rotor {{is more likely to}} make contact with stator under tight clearance conditions. Due to the presence of both Pedestal looseness and rub-impact, the whole system becomes highly nonlinear and instability. The present study is aimed to simulate a chaotic system of the nonlinear rotor system and the system can adaptively be converted to normal working state under the circumstance of the chaotic state occasioned by outside perturbation for the complicated chaotic system. The nonlinear dynamic equations of rotor-bearing system with coupling faults of pedestal looseness and rub-impact force are derived and a multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm is given. As a result, it is found that those systems possess various nonlinear dynamical <b>inherences.</b> The numerical results also show that the parametric adaptive control method is appropriate to those rotor-bearing systems, outside interference under the state of chaos arising from the situation can be adaptive to adjust to normal working condition. It has strongly control capability of stability. The theoretical and practical idea for controlling rotor–bearing systems and optimizing their operation can be more precise. </p...|$|R
40|$|From {{human to}} human(e) is an {{exploration}} of ways of coming {{to understand what it}} means to be(come) human and to belong (Vanier, 2003) while living and working as an educator in a disadvantaged community. In this sense, the purpose of this dissertation is the exploration of understanding what it might mean to be a ‘Foundation Phase’ (Primary/Elementary School) educator in a context of constructed poverty and disadvantage (Swanson 2004), thereby contributing to the field of education in this area, whilst embracing a practice of freedom and fostering apertures of hope and transcendence. This reflexive, rhizomatic narrative journeying (ibid) attempts to reach out to humanity via an interdisciplinary and arts-based approach that attempts to address concerns of inequity and pedagogical in-access and evokes the spiritual, emotive and philosophical in drawing attention to the ethical irresponsibility and socio-spiritual repercussions of ignoring social disadvantage in education. It includes <b>inherences</b> and impressions of humaneness in education. It seeks both introspection and insight into what ‘the human condition’ might mean to a just and robust education of children. In this sense, it is a personal inquiry as reflexive narrative journeying (ibid) based on twenty seven years of teaching in a primary school in a vulnerable and economically-impoverished community in the province of KwaZulu Natal in South Africa. As a writing-as-inquiry journeying, I engage with ‘critical rhizomatic narrative’ methodology (Swanson, 2004) as it resonates with the explorations of lived experiences that pertain to emotions, feelings, values and spirituality and because it enables a process of seeking what it might mean to be(come) human(e). This study is a philosophical rhizomatic narrative rendering which is an approach to(wards) understandings of personal growth and spirituality through understanding the various emergent journeys of life and the meanings that we can elicit from them to become more human and thus more humane...|$|R

2500|$|In his analysis, svabhāva is {{somewhat}} redefined from the Theravada interpretation to mean: inherent existence or self-characterization. Nagarjuna is notably departing from {{the interpretation of}} that term as merely meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If an object was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. <b>Inherence</b> would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty.|$|E

It is perfectly easy to conceive that states of consciousness are self-subsistent. And, if the substance of the soul is defined as that in which perceptions inhere, what is meant by the <b>inherence?</b> Is such <b>inherence</b> conceivable?

[...] Hence the appearance of separation or isolation in anything, and of self-dependence, is an appearance of imperfection: and all appearances of connection and brotherhood are pleasant and right, both as significative of perfection in the things united, and as typical of that Unity which we attribute to God, and of which our true conception is rightly explained and limited by Dr. Brown in his XCII. lecture; that Unity which consists not in his own singleness or separation, but in the necessity of his <b>inherence</b> in all things that be, without which no creature of any kind could hold existence for a moment. Which necessity of Divine essence I think it better to speak of as comprehensiveness, than as unity, because unity is often understood {{in the sense of}} oneness or singleness, instead of universality, whereas the only Unity which by any means can become grateful or an object of hope to men, and whose types therefore in material things can be beautiful, is that on which turned the last words and prayer of Christ before his crossing of the Kidron brook.

6000|$|The Cartesian Cogito ergo sum is objectionable, because {{either the}} Cogito is used extra gradum, {{and then it}} is {{involved}} to the sum and is tautological; or it is taken as a particular mode or dignity, and then it is subordinated to the sum as the species to the genus, or rather as a particular modification to the subject modified; and not pre- ordinated as the arguments seem to require. For Cogito is Sum Cogitans. This is clear by the inevidence of the converse. Cogitat, ergo est is true, {{because it is a}} mere application of the logical rule: Quicquid in genere est, est et in specie. Est (cogitans), ergo est. It is a cherry tree; therefore it is a tree. But, est ergo cogitat, is illogical: for quod est in specie, non NBCESSARIO in genere est. It may be true. I hold it to be true, that quicquid vere est, est per veram sui affirmationem; but it is a derivative, not an immediate truth. Here then we have, by anticipation, the distinction between the conditional finite!

50|$|Arguments refuting the <b>inherence</b> criticism, however, {{claim that}} a form of {{something}} spatial can lack a concrete (spatial) location and yet have in abstracto spatial qualities. An apple, then, can have the same shape as its form. Such arguments typically claim {{that the relationship between}} a particular and its form is very intelligible and easily grasped; that people unproblematically apply Platonic theory in everyday life; and that the <b>inherence</b> criticism is only created by the artificial demand to explain the normal understanding of <b>inherence</b> as if it were highly problematic. That is, the supporting argument claims that the criticism is with the mere illusion of a problem and thus could render suspect any philosophical concept.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{primitive}} {{concept in}} substance theory is the <b>inherence</b> of properties within a substance.

All relations, holds this school of Hinduism, is dyadic between anuyogin (referend) and pratiyogin (referent). <b>Inherence</b> (samavaya) is one of its seven categories of relations, as is quality (guna), being (bhava), genus (samanya), species (vishesha), substance (dravya) and motion/action (karman).
