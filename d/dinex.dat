50|$|Daniel Johnnes (born 1955 in Manhattan, New York) is an American sommelier {{and wine}} entrepreneur, and is {{currently}} the Wine Director for Daniel Boulud's <b>Dinex</b> restaurant group. He {{is also known as}} the founder and host of La Paulée de New York and La Paulée de San Francisco which are inspired by the traditional Burgundian harvest celebration La Paulée de Meursault.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Johnnes {{has been}} the Wine Director for Daniel Boulud's <b>Dinex</b> group since 2005. From 1985-2005, Johnnes worked as the Wine Director for Drew Nieporent's Myriad {{restaurant}} group including his flagship restaurant Montrachet, where he built the wine list around France's Burgundy region. In 1994, he brought the [...] "Grand Award" [...] from Wine Spectator to restaurant Montrachet, which was anointed one of New York's finest wine restaurants by the same publication.|$|E
50|$|While {{raised on}} a farm outside of Lyon and trained by renowned French chefs, Boulud made his {{reputation}} in New York, first as a chef and most recently a restaurateur. His management company, The <b>Dinex</b> Group, currently includes fifteen restaurants, three locations of a gourmet grocery (Epicerie Boulud) and Feast & Fêtes Catering. His restaurants include Daniel, DB Brasserie, Café Boulud, DB Bistro Moderne, Bar Boulud, DBGB Kitchen & Bar, and Boulud Sud in New York City. He has also launched numerous restaurant concepts in other American cities and across the globe.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} year, {{we have begun}} the {{development}} of a new restaurant guide domain, <b>DINEX,</b> which utilizes all of the same core technology as our other GALAXY systems [2]. The domain server has been adapted from our CityGuide domain within our GALAXY framework, using the same mechanisms to locate places on the map or to give directions. The system has information on several features for restaurants, such as hours, cuisine, parking availability, and an on-line menu. <b>DINEX</b> knows over 450 restaurants in the Boston area, and can also provide directions from subway stops or well-known landmarks. <b>DINEX</b> makes use of a relational database derived from several on-line sources, including a nationally known travel guide. This paper particularly emphasizes the language tools we have developed to construct the relational database semi-automatically and to derive from user queries the appropriate SQL queries for accessing the database. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} for {{the first}} time the scattering process of 7 Be nuclei from a 58 Ni target at 23. 2 MeV beam energy. The experiment was performed at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (LNL, Italy), where the 7 Be Radioactive Ion Beam was in-flight produced with the facility EXOTIC. Charged reaction products were detected by means of the detector array <b>DINEX,</b> arranged in a cylindrical configuration around the target to ensure a polar angle coverage in the ranges θcm = 40 °- 80 ° and 110 °- 150 °. The scattering differential cross section was analyzed within the optical model formalism with the coupled-channel code FRESCO to extract the total reaction cross section. The result was compared with those obtained at lower beam energies in an earlier experiment performed at the University of Notre Dame (USA). At the present stage of our analysis, the two data sets were found to be not fully consistent each other...|$|E
