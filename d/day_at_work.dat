Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him.

They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together.

[...] "As the {{daughter}} of the Medici," [...] suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, [...] "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."

500|$|In December 2003, The Times Libby Purves wrote a {{critical}} opinion piece, observing that Holby City medical staff are often depicted getting drunk in clubs, but afterwards {{are able to}} function properly at work, and that as a result, alcohol [...] "is made to look innocent". In October 2004, Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of Alcohol Focus Scotland, criticised an episode of Holby City which saw doctors downing tequila slammers, stating that it glamorised irresponsible drinking.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{treatment of}} group A beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis with amoxycillin once daily compared with phenoxymethylpenicillin {{three or four}} times a day. DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled study of consecutive patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of group A beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in whom culture of a throat swab yielded positive results. SETTING [...] Five family medicine practices. SUBJECTS [...] 157 patients aged over 3 years who required treatment with antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical response, bacteriological response, <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and school lost, and compliance. RESULTS [...] During the period of the study 393 patients presented with symptoms suggesting streptococcal pharyngitis; 157 of them had throat swabs that yielded positive results on culture. Eighty two were treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin and 75 with amoxycillin. No difference was observed in the clinical response, <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and school lost (139 days for 64 patients taking phenoxymethylpenicillin v 100 days for 57 patients taking amoxycillin; p > 0. 2), or residual positive cultures after two days (6 (7. 3 %) v 3 (4 %); p > 0. 5). A significant difference in the bacteriological response was found after 14 days (5 (6. 1 %) v 0; p < 0. 04) with no positive cultures observed in the amoxycillin group. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings support the hypothesis that amoxycillin once daily is as effective as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of group A beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis...|$|R
