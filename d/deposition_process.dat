25|$|The {{production}} of small molecule devices and displays usually involves thermal evaporation in a vacuum. This makes {{the production process}} more expensive and of limited use for large-area devices, than other processing techniques. However, contrary to polymer-based devices, the vacuum <b>deposition</b> <b>process</b> enables the formation of well controlled, homogeneous films, {{and the construction of}} very complex multi-layer structures. This high flexibility in layer design, enabling distinct charge transport and charge blocking layers to be formed, is the main reason for the high efficiencies of the small molecule OLEDs.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{application of}} tungsten fluoride is in semiconductor industry, {{where it is}} widely used for depositing tungsten metal in a chemical vapor <b>deposition</b> <b>process.</b> The expansion of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the increase of WF6 consumption, which remains at around 200 tonnes per year worldwide. Tungsten metal is attractive because of its relatively high thermal and chemical stability, as well as low resistivity (5.6 µΩ·cm) and electromigration. WF6 is favored over related compounds, such as WCl6 or WBr6, because of its higher vapor pressure resulting in higher deposition rates. Since 1967, two WF6 deposition routes have been developed and employed, thermal decomposition and hydrogen reduction. The required WF6 gas purity is rather high and varies between 99.98% and 99.9995% depending on the application.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} behaviors of species of Parischnogaster is the egg <b>deposition</b> <b>process.</b> The ovipositing female uses an abdominal substance produced by herself to handle the egg. In the first stage, the wasp collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance in her mouth. The patch is then placed into the cell. In the second stage, the wasp bends her abdomen towards her mouth. As the egg emerges from the abdomen the female will grasp it with its mouthparts. The final stage consists of collecting another patch of abdominal substance to place on top of the egg in the cell. This process may have evolved for defense purposes. Since P. alternata typically take on flight as an active defense, this method helps the female save the egg they are laying if disturbed by an attack.|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{techniques}} for the fabrication of compound semiconductors are mostly vacuum-based physical vapor or chemical vapor <b>deposition</b> <b>processes.</b> These vacuum-based techniques typically operate at high temperatures and normally require higher capital costs. Solution-based techniques offer opportunities to fabricate compound semiconductors at lower temperatures and lower capital costs. Among many solution-based <b>deposition</b> <b>processes,</b> chemical bath <b>deposition</b> {{is an attractive}} technique for depositing semiconductor films, owing to its low temperature, low cost and large area deposition capability. Chemical bath <b>deposition</b> <b>processes</b> are mainly performed using batch reactors, where all reactants are fed into the reactor simultaneously and products are removed after the processing is finished. Consequently, reaction selectivity is difficult, {{which can lead to}} unwanted secondary reactions. Microreactor-assisted solution <b>deposition</b> <b>processes</b> can overcome this limitation by producing short-life molecular intermediates used for heterogeneous thin film synthesis and quenching the reaction prior to homogeneous reactions. In this paper, we present progress in the synthesis and deposition of semiconductor thin films with a focus on CdS using microreactor-assisted solution deposition and provide an overview of its prospect for scale-up...|$|R

25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The <b>deposition</b> <b>process</b> can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of transferring silica {{absorbed by the}} diatom to the cell wall is unknown, though research is still being undertaken. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from {{the search for the}} {{mechanism of}} silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the frustule. The most success in this area has come from two species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and Cylindrotheca fusiformis, in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered. Silaffins, sets of polycationic peptides, were found in C. fusiformis cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns1. When T. pseudonana underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a urea cycle, including a higher number of polyamines than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes. In a phylogenetic study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species. This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (bilateral symmetry) and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica <b>deposition</b> <b>process.</b> Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.|$|E

2500|$|Debate {{over the}} corona's finish {{continued}} into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the scrim, as {{it created a}} [...] "shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions" [...] and [...] "conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty". Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting {{that it had a}} [...] "putty-like appearance under overcast conditions" [...] and visually fell [...] "far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design". A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration. Electroless plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A physical vapor <b>deposition</b> <b>process</b> involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF).
