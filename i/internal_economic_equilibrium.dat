In this period, which was {{considerably}} influenced by the global economic recession, a sharp deterioration in public finances and other macroeconomic indicators is apparent. The theoretical part of the thesis {{deals with the}} starting points and putting the issue of public finances. The practical part {{is dedicated to the}} development and comparison of basic indicators of internal economic balance across the member countries, especially to the depth and dynamics of the public debt. In the final part, attention is paid to the prospects of development in this field at European Union level and at the level of national states...|$|E

40|$|This paper makes four propositions. First, it {{argues that}} the euro’s {{institutional}} design makes it function like the interwar gold exchange standard during periods of stress. Just like the gold exchange standard during the 1930 s, the euro created a ‘core’ of surplus countries and a ‘periphery’ of deficit countries. The latter have to sacrifice their <b>internal</b> domestic <b>economic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in order to restore their external equilibrium, and therefore {{have no choice but}} to respond to balance of payments crises by a series of deflationary spending, price and wage cuts. The paper’s second claim is that the euro’s institutional design and the EU’s response to its ‘sovereign debt crisis’ during 2010 - 13 deepened the recession in the Eurozone periphery, as EMU leaders focused almost exclusively on austerity measures and structural reforms and paid only lip service to the need to rebalance growth between North and South. As Barry Eichengreen argued in Golden Fetters, the rigidity of the gold standard contributed to the length and depth of the Great Depression during the 1930 s, but also underscored the incompatibility of the system with legitimate national democratic government in places like Italy, Germany, and Spain, which is the basis for the paper’s third proposition: the euro crisis instigated a crisis of democratic government in Southern Europe underlining that democratic legitimacy still mainly resides within the borders of nation states. By adopting the euro, EMU member states gave up their ability to control major economic policy decisions, thereby damaging their domestic political legitimacy, which in turn dogged attempts to enact structural reforms. Evidence of the erosion of national democracy in the Eurozone periphery can be seen in the rise of anti-establishment parties, and the inability of traditional center-left and center-right parties to form stable governments and implement reforms. The paper’s fourth proposition is that the euro’s original design and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis further widened the existing democratic deficit in the European Union, as manifested in rising anti-EU and anti-euro sentiment, as well as openly Eurosceptic political movements, not just in the euro periphery, but also increasingly in the euro core...|$|R

This relation holds when we control for economic preferences and possible confounders such as financial literacy, overconfidence, optimism, trust, and other personality traits.

40|$|A {{model of}} the general <b>economic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of {{sequential}} structures includes the asset market, where assets are instruments of sequential income redistribution. The model should explain relative prices of commodities, on one hand, and establish the asset pricing {{as an instrument of}} income redistribution, on the other, enabling the analysis of sequential income transfers. This paper mainly researches Pareto’s optimum of a defined mathematical {{model of the}} general <b>economic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in both complete and incomplete asset markets. The existence of the latter partly disables an economic system to transfer income through time sequences properly, which results in equilibrium allocations not reaching Pareto’s optimum. ...|$|R
