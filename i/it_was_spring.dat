500|$|... "All Is Full of Love", {{the closing}} track of Homogenic, was the album's last song {{to be written}} and recorded. Produced by Björk, the {{original}} version of the song was replaced [...] "at the last minute" [...] by Howie B's version. It {{was inspired by the}} spring while producing the album in Málaga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Björk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realized <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the move}} to Ireland, {{production}} had started on the studio's second feature, The Land Before Time. [...] Again, Amblin and Spielberg backed the production, with additional input from friend of Spielberg and Star Wars creator George Lucas, {{who had worked with}} Spielberg on the initial story treatment. [...] The movie had been rushed into its early production stages even before the release of An American Tail to meet an Autumn 1987 release date, a very tight schedule for a feature-length animated film. However, between delays caused by the disruption of {{the move to}} Dublin, and the unwillingness of Amblin and Universal to fully commit to the project until An American Tails release, production fell behind by several months, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Spring</b> 1987 before it reached full stride.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun rose}} gloriously. With {{mountain}} fickleness {{the wind blew}} gently from the east, the air was precisely like late March, and the short and tender grass, the small flowers in the sheltered corners of the rocks, and the multitudinous bleatings of the lambs were all in keeping. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> {{in the world and}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> {{in the heart of the}} ranger, in spite of all his perplexities. The Basque would recover, the heroic ex-convict would not be stricken, and all would be well. Of such resiliency is the heart of youth.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> at Bellecour--the {{spring of}} 1789, a short {{three months before}} the fall of the Bastille came to give the nobles pause, and make them realise that these new philosophies, which so long they have derided, were by no means the idle vapours they had deemed them.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the young}} man gave her his promise to make her his wife, and the girl {{fulfilled}} her part of the bargain, and food was plentiful on the island all through the long winter months, though he never knew how it got there.

6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> {{the first}} time that I saw her, for her papa and mamma [...] moved in [...] Next door, just as skating was over, and marbles about to begin; [...] For the fence in our back yard was broken, and I saw, as I peeped [...] through the slat, [...] There were [...] "Johnny-jump-ups" [...] all around her, and I knew it was [...] spring just by that.|$|E
60|$|The Easter {{holidays}} began happily. Paul {{was his own}} frank self. Yet {{she felt}} it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood, in whose branches a twilight was tangled, below the bright sky of the afternoon. Grey-green rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window, some already, she fancied, showing bud. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> which she loved and dreaded.|$|E
6000|$|I wish <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>spring</b> cunningly blowing on {{the fallen}} sparks, odds and [...] {{ends of the}} old, {{scattered}} fire, and kindling shapely little conflagrations curious long-legged foals, and wide-eared calves, [...] and naked sparrow-bubs.|$|R

60|$|Pretty soon <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> {{and sunny}} and {{pleasant}} and lovely, {{and the sweet}} mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by, and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin, and the master wasn't any company for us, but we played together and had good times, and the servants were kind and friendly, so we got along quite happily and counted the days {{and waited for the}} family.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} one point on which Mary would let nobody have {{his or her own}} way; on which the way to be taken was very manifestly to be her own. This was {{touching}} the marriage settlements. It must not be supposed, that if Beatrice were married on a Tuesday, Mary could be married on the Tuesday week following. Ladies with twelve thousand a year cannot be disposed of in that way: and bridegrooms who do their duty by marrying money often have to be kept waiting. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> the early spring, before Frank was made altogether a happy man.|$|E
60|$|Sammy Jay's eyes sparkled as {{he watched}} that spot of green under the pile of brush in the swamp through which the Laughing Brook finds its way to join the Big River. All around was water, for you know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> and the melting snows on the hills way up where the Big River has its {{beginning}} were pouring more water into the Big River than its banks would hold as it hurried down to the Great Ocean. It just couldn't hurry fast enough to take all that water down {{as fast as it}} ran into the Big River, and so the water had crept over the banks in places. It had done this right here in the little swamp where Sammy was.|$|E

50|$|Without any {{promotion}} {{or in any}} way {{letting the}} listeners to The Shebang know, Friday 31 October 2008 brought about the final edition of The Shebang. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sprung</b> without warning, with Fifi Box and Paul Murray left to say goodbye without the presence of Marty Sheargold.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> I have said. The air {{was still}} except when {{broken by the}} hum of the large black bramra bee, as he plied his task amidst the red and orange flowers of the dak, and by the gushings of many waters that made music as they coursed down their stuccoed {{channels}} between borders of many coloured poppies and beds of various flowers. From time to time the dulcet note of the kokila bird, and the hoarse plaint of the turtle-dove deep hid in her leafy bower, attracted every ear and thrilled every heart. The south wind--"breeze of the south,[FN#145] the friend of love and spring" [...] blew with a voluptuous warmth, for rain clouds canopied the earth, and the breath of the narcissus, the rose, and the citron, teemed with a languid fragrance.|$|E
60|$|Reynolds {{has been}} very ill for some time, {{confined}} to the house, and had leeches applied to his chest; when I saw him on Wednesday he was much the same, and {{he is in the}} worst place for amendment, among the strife of women's tongues, in a hot and parch'd room: I wish he would move to Butler's for a short time. The Thrushes and Blackbirds have been singing me into an idea that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Spring,</b> and almost that leaves were on the trees. So that black clouds and boisterous winds seem to have mustered and collected in full Divan, for the purpose of convincing me to the contrary. Taylor says my poem shall be out in a month, I think he will be out before it....|$|E
6000|$|On {{an early}} June evening Rainbow Valley was an entirely {{delightful}} {{place and the}} children felt it to be so, as {{they sat in the}} open glade where the bells rang elfishly on the Tree Lovers, and the White Lady shook her green tresses. The wind was laughing and whistling about them like a leal, glad-hearted comrade. The young ferns were spicy in the hollow. [...] The wild cherry trees scattered over the valley, among the dark firs, were mistily white. The robins were whistling over in the maples behind Ingleside. Beyond, on the slopes of the Glen, were blossoming orchards, sweet and mystic and wonderful, veiled in dusk. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> and young things MUST be glad in spring. Everybody was glad in Rainbow Valley that evening--until Mary Vance froze their blood with the story of Henry Warren's ghost.|$|E

60|$|The {{marriage}} {{morning of}} Ralph and Suzanne broke brightly; never have I seen a fairer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring</b> time, and the veldt was clothed with the fresh green grass and starred everywhere with the lily blooms that sprang among it. The wind blew softly, shaking down the dewdrops from the growing corn, while from every bush and tree came the cooing of unnumbered doves. Beneath the eave of the stoep {{the pair of}} red-breasted swallows which had built there {{for so many years}} were finishing their nest, and I watched them idly, for to me they were old friends, and would wheel about my head, touching my cheek with their wings. Just then they paused from their task, or perhaps it was at length completed, and flying to a bough of the peach tree a few yards away, perched there together amidst the bright bloom, and nestling against each other, twittered forth their song of joy and love.|$|E
60|$|And it did. North {{dispatched}} a second letter to Maria {{saying that he}} had already made other arrangements for the baby. Pleased with her easy victory, Miss Bessy became more than usually gracious, and the next day bowed her shapely neck meekly to the yoke of her teacher, and became a docile pupil. James North could not have helped noticing her ready intelligence, even had he been less prejudiced in her favor than he was fast becoming now. If he had found it pleasant before to be admonished by her there was still more delicious flattery in her perfect trust in his omniscient skill as a pilot over this unknown sea. There was a certain enjoyment in guiding her hand over the writing-book, that I fear he could not have obtained from an intellect less graciously sustained by its physical nature. The weeks flew quickly by on gossamer wings, and when she placed a bunch of larkspurs and poppies in his hand one morning, he remembered for the first that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
60|$|PAUL was {{dissatisfied}} with himself and with everything. The deepest {{of his love}} belonged to his mother. When {{he felt he had}} hurt her, or wounded his love for her, he could not bear it. Now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>spring,</b> and there was battle between him and Miriam. This year he had a good deal against her. She was vaguely aware of it. The old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love, which she had had when she prayed, was mingled in all her emotions. She did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him. She did not believe in herself primarily: doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her. Certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him. She saw tragedy, sorrow, and sacrifice ahead. And in sacrifice she was proud, in renunciation she was strong, for she did not trust herself to support everyday life. She was prepared for the big things and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust.|$|E
