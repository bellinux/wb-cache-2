5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only {{known each other for}} a short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> made a mistake.|$|E

60|$|On the whole, Helen was not displeased. Mrs. Charnock's bold {{statements}} that <b>she</b> could <b>have</b> got Stephen <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wanted had jarred, {{but it looked}} as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made an empty boast.|$|R

5|$|The next day, Megan tells Don {{that her}} {{audition}} gained her a callback for Little Murders and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston. He voices his displeasure at her being gone for three months. She accuses him of expecting her acting career to fail. When the callback {{does not go}} well, she tells him that, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to choose {{between him and the}} play, she would choose him, but will hate him for it. He assures her that he does not want her to fail, and they kiss.|$|E
5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when {{he thought he was}} essential {{to the future of the}} firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{always been}} his kindest friend; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> treated him through all his {{servitude}} with such consideration as was never yet received by struggling man; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lightened {{every moment of}} those many years, and had ever spared and never wounded him; his honest heart could not have swelled before her with a deeper pity, or a purer freedom from all base remembrance than it did then.|$|R
60|$|She ran {{to meet me}} as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter; {{she kissed}} me as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter; she fondly {{looked up at me}} as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so patiently {{enduring}} sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant.|$|R
5000|$|I {{asked her}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any suggestions. <b>She</b> said, what about Tempest Storm? I asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any other suggestions. Well, she said, what about Sunny Day? Well, I said, I guess {{it might as}} well be Tempest Storm.|$|R
5|$|Leonard Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is the Fury 161 {{preacher and}} {{chaplain}} to the prisoners. An inmate {{with a history}} of murder and rape, he turned to God while incarcerated. Dillon {{is one of the few}} prisoners to whom Ripley speaks after her arrival; he asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> faith, and says that his men have faith enough to accept anyone. He delivers an eloquent eulogy during Newt and Hicks' funeral which touches Ripley. When prisoners try to rape her, Dillon bashes them with a crowbar. Ripley asks Dillon to kill her and the gestating Alien inside her, and he promises to do so when the Alien is dead. Shortly afterwards, Dillon organizes the remaining prisoners to lure the Alien into the foundry and drown it in molten lead. When the Alien attempts to follow Ripley out of the trap, Dillon baits it; when it attacks, Ripley submerges them both in the molten lead.|$|E
5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> gathered enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him in reproach so deep that the last vestige of the terror of death was gone from her eyes. It was as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said, and more than <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said: [...] "I have only you to live for." ...|$|R
60|$|Because <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{not known}} how to nurse him well, he would perhaps have never grown up alive and strong. And <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not {{known how to}} make him obey and speak the truth, he might have grown up a naughty boy.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{he went to}} her door, {{and stood}} there listening. He could hear no sound whatever. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been crying <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been laughing--it {{would have been better}} than this silence. He put his hands up to his ears and ran down-stairs.|$|R
5|$|Stacey {{explains}} to Dot that Bradley {{knew he was}} not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), who tells her he already knows. Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, he wonders <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her {{that she needs to}} keep the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that she}} killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him out as he is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is not good enough for Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) by Valmiki {{does not}} mention Maya Sita. Sita, the princess of Mithila, is married to Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. Rama is forced {{to go on a}} 14-year exile and is {{accompanied}} by Sita and his brother Lakshmana. Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, plots to abduct Sita, aided by Maricha, who transforms into a magical golden deer (Maya mriga, an illusional deer), that entices Sita. While in exile in Dandaka forest, Rama goes after the deer and slays it. The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama's voice. Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama, leaving her alone. Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her. He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. When Rama doubts Sita's chastity, she undergoes a trial by fire (Agni Pariksha). Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been faithful to Rama let the fire not harm her; she comes out unscathed with the fire-god Agni as proof of her purity. Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Wee-Bey tells De'londa Brice that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> thrown Namond {{out then}} he will stay out of her care. De'Londa claims that {{she is trying to}} harden Namond and Wee-Bey threatens that if she does not let their son go, he will use his {{reputation}} against her. She asks Wee-Bey if he is cutting her off, but he reassures her that their relationship is not over.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{baffling}} metaphor. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> used plain forecastle English, {{and said}} [...] "God wrote the Key and I {{put it in}} my book"; or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said [...] "God furnished me the solution of the mystery and I put it on paper"; or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said [...] "God did it all," [...] then we should understand; but her phrase is open to any and all of those translations, and is a Key which unlocks nothing--for us. However, it seems to at least mean [...] "God inspired me," [...] if nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|And yet she {{retained}} her dignity.

25|$|If {{the wife}} is widowed by her late husband, {{then it is}} the duty of the {{father-in-law}} to provide for her. This legal obligation only comes into effect if the widowed wife has no other means of providing for herself. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> land of her own, or means of an income and can maintain herself then the father-in-law is free from obligation to her. Additionally, if the widow remarries then her late husband's father-in-law does is not legally bound by this Act anymore as well.|$|E
25|$|The novel then {{tells of}} Persephone's {{abduction}} by Hades, and Demeter's search for her.

Zeus agrees to let Persephone return <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not tasted the food of the dead.

60|$|I went along. One has {{to rally}} round a pal in distress. Aunt Isabel was sitting bolt upright, as usual.
