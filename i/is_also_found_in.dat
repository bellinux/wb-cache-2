The Alpine chough <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two {{areas of the}} Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In {{the northern and southern}} parts of its range, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
5|$|Densities {{of giant}} clams reach {{up to four}} per square foot {{in parts of the}} lagoon. The most common species is the “small giant clam” Tridacna maxima and largest clam species, Tridacna gigas <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the lagoon.|$|E

5|$|Galerina marginata {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, continental Asia, and the Caucasus. In North America, it has been collected {{as far north as}} the boreal forest of Canada and subarctic and arctic habitats in Labrador, and south to Jalisco, Mexico. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Australia.|$|E
5|$|Gallium {{is found}} {{primarily}} in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> some compounds. For example, the very stable GaCl2 contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as GaIGaIIICl4; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0°C disproportionating into elemental gallium and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing gallium-gallium bonds are true gallium(II) compounds; for example, GaS can be formulated Ga24+(S2−)2, and the dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2 contains a Ga–Ga bond.|$|E

5|$|In PVC, cadmium {{was used}} as heat, light, and {{weathering}} stabilizers. Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, because a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance.

5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It {{has been much}} more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|Kaumodaki (IAST: Kaumodakī) is the gada (mace) of the Hindu god Vishnu.
