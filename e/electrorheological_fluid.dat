40|$|A {{tactile display}} device {{utilizes}} an <b>electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> to activate {{a plurality of}} tactile dots. A voltage is selectively produced uniformly across an <b>electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> flowing between a common ground electrode and a plurality of conductive dot electrodes, thereby producing {{an increase in the}} fluid's viscosity to the extent that fluid flow between the two electrodes is restricted. The flow restriction produces a build-up of <b>electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> in a corresponding dot actuator chamber. The resulting pressure increase in the chamber displaces an elastic diaphragm fixed to a display surface to form a lump which can be perceived by the reader as one dot in a Braille character cell.

40|$|This thesis explores {{two methods}} of calculating {{the flow of}} <b>Electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> in a {{microfluidic}} channel {{in response to a}} gradient in an electric field: MATLAB simulation and microscopy experiments. <b>Electrorheological</b> <b>fluid,</b> which is composed of particles suspended in a liquid, has the property of changing its viscosity under the application of an electric field. The particles become polarized in an electric field, aligning themselves with a force that is proportional to the gradient of the electric field. The drag force equally opposes the dipole force and can entrain fluid and force it to move along the length of a channel. The dipole force was estimated using a MATLAB simulation, and the drag force was calculated via experiments which used <b>Electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> in a channel lined with electrodes.

40|$|An <b>electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> (ERF) is {{typically}} a suspension of semi-conducting solid particles dispersed in an insulating carrier fluid, and shows {{a dramatic change}} in rheological properties when an external electric field is applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The dynamic {{behavior}} of the commercially used <b>electrorheological</b> <b>fluid</b> RheOil 3. 0 is measured under well-defined conditions. Measurements were carried out in shear mode {{as well as in}} flow mode using flow channels that provide similar flow conditions to many electrorheological applications. The response times of the change in flow behavior upon a changed electric field are measured. Measurements were carried out in time domain (single step response) as well as in frequency domain (sinusoidal frequency sweep). In most flow conditions, the observed dynamic behavior is characterized by two leading response times of which the fast one is in the millisecond range. Under stable flow or constant shear rate conditions, ionic conductivity is found to be a limiting factor for a quick step response.

The characteristics of this ER valve are modeled theoretically and its major design parameters are identified thereafter. In addition, by applying electric field upon the concentric electrodes of the ER valve, the controllability of the output displacement due to {{the change in the}} stiffness and damping properties of the ER fluid is investigated experimentally. It is found that the cross-talk between two output units is insignificant in this design setup and therefore, two units can be operated independently. Finally, the transient responses of the output fluid chamber under the pulse-type controlled electric field with different duty time and phase are measured. It is concluded that under the sinusoidal excitation of the displacement amplitude, the output chamber can have minimal response as the controlled electric field is at its highest permissible magnitude and zero phase lag.
