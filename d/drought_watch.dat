40|$|Now you {{can make}} your own {{monitoring}} system. Only one hitch: you need a computer. Are you looking for physical details about your area? GIS may have an answer. Geographical Information Systems bring together all sorts of geographic data maps, satellite images, aerial photos, statistics and texts. With integrated and up-to-date GIS information, natural resource management (NRM) can be improved, with better analysis, forecasting and planning. GIS have many very useful applications in NRM, rural development and risk prevention, but there is a but. You have to be able to obtain the data. Here are some leads. In the field of NRM, increasing numbers of livestock are causing numerous problems: overgrazing, deforestation and water shortages and pollution. By using GIS data, it is possible to combine these multiple factors and to analyse their inter-relationships. Some Websites provide examples: www. fao. org/ giews/english/Basedocs/ lacbase. htm provides satellite images of each country with the state of vegetation from year to year. The site of the US Geological Survey - edcwww. cr. usgs. gov/earthshots/ slow/ tableofcontentsmap provides satellite images of year-by-year trends in land use in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Watch it grow, erode, burn: Santo Domingo's changing vegetation Mauritania and Senegal. The University of Maryland has set up a GIS which pulls together the key elements of information available on vegetation, climate, population and infrastructure in all the countries of central Africa, on a regional scale (1 : 1, 000, 000). Its analysis of changes in vegetation cover is aimed at improving NRM in the countries concerned (carpe. gecp. virginia. edu/ french/gisthemes. html). Hydrological data (locations, rainfall data, ground reservoirs) are available on-line on the HAPEX - Sahel Hydrology GIS at gaya. mpl. orstom. fr/grasslinks/. On a more modest scale, the site www. nhm. ac. uk/botany/projects_ research/project 3 /index. html shows the results of a survey of the ecosystem of the 'Maya Mountains' in Belize, drawing on satellite images and land-based observations. Harvests can be predicted through monitoring crop growth. This can be clearly seen on the FAO site geoweb. fao. org/, which gives access to the data used in the Global Information and Early Warning System on food and agriculture (GIEWS) for each country in the world. Several early warning systems are of immediate value for ACP countries, providing maps which are regularly updated for weather <b>watches</b> (<b>drought,</b> heavy rainfall, cyclones) and monitoring of crop pests. On the site of the World Meteorological Organisation (www. wmo. ch) there is live weather information drawn from nine satellites and 17, 000 monitoring stations. It includes details about El Niño and La Niña, meteorological and marine information and links to national meteorological offices. Similarly, the site www. intellicast. com/LocalWeather/World/ contents. html will give weather forecasts for the next days in thousands of towns and cities, from Timbuktu to Johannesburg. And FAO provides weekly updates on locust infestations (see Spore 84) on [URL] If these examples have whetted your appetite and you want to know more about how a GIS works, you can go online and even download free software to make a start. The GIEWS mentioned above allows you to make personalised maps of a country (geoweb. fao. org/GeoWEB. exe$ChooseCtry) providing information from the FAO database and satellite images from its ARTEMIS: basis maps, indications of crops and topics by zone using statistics of population, agricultural production, cloud cover, and vegetation, along with detailed instructions on compiling your map. FAO also has a free software called WinDisp (www. fao. org/giews/ english/windisp/windisp. htm.) for displaying and analysing satellite images, maps and databases, with an emphasis on early warning systems for food security. Another software programme Arcview can be downloaded from www. ce. utexas. edu/prof/ maidment/gishydro/africa/ ex 1 af/ex 1 af. htm, and used in analysing meteorological data, on the Niger basin for example. If you want to go further than these sites and get a real training in GIS, several universities provide short (1 to 3 year) post-graduate courses, and there are specialised bodies such as the ITC (International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, PO Box 6, 7500 AA Enschede, Netherlands Fax : + 31 53 487 44 00 Email : pr@itc. nl). Luckily for many, GIS are not just accessible on the Internet. True, the Net is a good place to play host to data of this kind, but it is almost as easy to obtain maps, software and all sorts of data from research institutes, national geographic bodies and map publishers. However, there is still a long way to go before all the data gathered by GIS is widely available, and even further to go before people at the grassroots can use the data, although encouraging steps are being made (see News in Brief). No wonder that the issue of data appropriation by people in the field was the focus of lively debate at the international seminar on GIS held by ITC and CTA in September 1997.

40|$|Abstract Drought is {{a natural}} hazard with varying {{patterns}} in space, time, and intensity. Because of the spatial and temporal variability and multiple impacts of drought, {{it is necessary to}} improve tools and data available for mapping and monitoring this phenomenon on all scales. Starting from some initiatives promoted by the European Community, an integrated <b>drought</b> <b>watch</b> system aimed at analysing and forecasting the effects produced by prolonged water deficit periods has been developed in southern Italy. Using GIS technologies integrated with tele-metering network, hydrological databases and distributed water balance models, it allows the analysis of different aspects of the wider drought phenomenon. Specifically, meteorological, agricultural and hydrological aspects have been together considered in a common framework according to the features required by Web-GIS applications with the aim of using Internet as a diffusion tool of the spatially distributed information managed by the system. In this paper, after {{a brief description of the}} <b>drought</b> <b>watch</b> system functionalities, the capability of detecting severe and prolonged water deficit periods have been verified in two regions in southern Italy during the last decade, considering meteorological and satellite indices together with the principal water balance components. The analysis carried out on the study area pointed out an extremely intense drought phenomenon during the period 1996 – 2002, characterised by a reduction in precipitation together with higher evapotranspiration values and, as a consequence, by a broad decrease in surface and groundwater runoff...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} indices for characterising {{hydrological}} drought {{have been devised}} which, in general, are data demanding and computationally intensive. On the contrary, for meteorological droughts very simple and effective indices such as the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) have been used. A methodology for characterising the severity of hydrological droughts is proposed which uses an index analogous to SPI, the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). Cumulative streamflow is used for overlapping periods of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months within each hydrological year. Drought states are defined which form a non-stationary Markov chain. Prediction of hydrological drought based on precipitation is also investigated. The methodology is validated using reliable data from the Evinos river basin (Greece). It can be easily applied within a <b>Drought</b> <b>Watch</b> System in river basins with significant storage works and can cope {{with the lack of}} streamflow data. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

From the existing simple and popular indices used for the estimation of drought, the Standardised Precipitation Index, known as SPI, seems to win universal applicability. A method based on the estimation of SPI over a geographical area and its use for characterising drought, is presented in this paper. Applications of the method are presented using a digital terrain model and a simple computer calculating routine. It is shown that the proposed procedure can be easily applied and can support a <b>Drought</b> <b>Watch</b> System for an area of mesoscale dimensions. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{conducted}} since the late 1970 s have evaluated state and federal responses to drought in the United States. Each of these studies {{identified a number of}} key issues and impedi-ments that needed to be addressed to improve the nation’s ability to cope with and prepare for future episodes of drought. A content analysis of these studies was performed to identify common threads in their recommendations. The premise of this analysis was that the series of drought years that oc-curred between 1986 and 1992 and recurred between 1994 and 1996 increased awareness of our na-tion’s continuing and apparent growing vulnerability to drought. This awareness has led to greater consensus among principal constituents and stakeholders, and also a greater sense of urgency to implement actions now to lessen vulnerability. The results of this analysis revealed that several themes recur: create an integrated national drought policy and plan; develop an integrated national climate monitoring (<b>drought</b> <b>watch)</b> system; incorporate drought in FEMA’s National Mitigation Strategy; conduct post-drought audits of response efforts; establish regional drought forums; and encourage development of state drought mitigation plans...|$|E
40|$|Droughts are {{difficult}} to detect and monitor. Drought indices, most commonly the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), have been used with limited success as operational drought monitoring tools and triggers for policy responses. Recently, a new index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), was developed to improve drought detection and monitoring capabilities. The SPI has several characteristics that are an improvement over previous indices, including its simplicity and temporal flexibility, that allow its application for water resources on all timescales. In this article, the 1996 drought in the southern plains and southwestern United States is examined using the SPI. A series of maps are used to illustrate how the SPI would have assisted {{in being able to}} detect the onset of the drought and monitor its progression. A case study investigating the drought in greater detail for Texas is also given. The SPI demonstrated that it is a tool that should be used operationally as part of a state, regional, or national <b>drought</b> <b>watch</b> system in the United States. During the 1996 drought, the SPI detected the onset of the drought at least 1 month in advance of the PDSI. This timeliness will be invaluable for improving mitigation and response actions of state and federal government to drought-affected regions in the future...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} climatological {{characteristics}} of the region of Murcia (11, 300 km 2), located almost entirely in the Segura Basin (in southeast Spain), is the great temporal and spatial irregularity of its precipitation. Average annual precipitation values range between 200 and 500 mm, and coefficients of variation (CV) are high, with some values about 50 %. It is a semiarid region (including a small arid area), and agriculture {{plays a major role}} in its economy. Because of this, drought is one characteristic of the region’s climate that has far-reaching consequences, from unemployment to social conflicts. It is important to define drought and identify appropriate indicators for the region of Murcia as part of a <b>drought</b> <b>watch</b> system. This system will define the temporal and spatial limits of drought conditions. It would help policy makers and government officials establish policies for the provision of aid to farmers and cattlemen, as in Australia (White and O’Meagher, 1995). Because of the wide range of drought impacts, there are many definitions of this phenomenon. However, one characteristic seems common to all of them: drought is caused by a deficiency in precipitation for a fairly long period of time. For simplicity, and keeping in mind that precipitation is, without doubt, the most important variable in the process, the watch system developed for the region of Murcia uses only this variable at the moment, establishing a comparison with a climatological reference (1961 – 90) that we consider “normal. ...|$|E
