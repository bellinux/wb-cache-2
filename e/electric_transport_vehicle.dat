40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a methodology for analytically comparing approaches to modular assembly of large space platforms. The methodology combines a physical {{model of the}} modules, a life-cycle cost model, and a risk model to capture influential trade-offs. The physical model includes alternative module design characteristics, assembly time scenarios, alternative work systems (human, robotic), and infrastructures. A life-cycle cost framework is defined to capture the benefits and costs of modular alternatives for single or multi-mission (programmatic) applications. A probabilistic risk model to address launch and assembly risks is employed to capture uncertainties in launch, {{as well as in}} the assembly approaches and their complexity (number of assembly steps, module connections). An illustration of the tradeoffs between these models for a single mission is described using a 448 kW Solar <b>Electric</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (SETV) supporting a human lunar mission. The illustration was limited to the launch and assembly phase from beginning of first element launch to completion of assembly. Results and observations are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The work {{is aimed}} {{to design a}} system for {{automatic}} selection of the optimal traffic modes and automatic monitoring of the electric energy consumption by electric transport. This automatic system should provide for the minimum energy expenses. Methodology. Current methodologies: 1) mathematical modeling of traffic modes of ground electric vehicles; 2) comparison of modelling results with the statistical monitoring; 3) system development for automatic choice of traffic modes of electric transport with minimal electrical energy consumptions {{taking into account the}} given route schedules and the limitations imposed by the general traffic rules. Findings. The authors obtained a mathematical dependency of the energy consumption by electric transport enterprises on the monthly averaged environment temperature was obtained. A system which allows for an automatic selection of the speed limit and provides automatic monitoring of the electrical energy consumption by electric vehicles was proposed in the form of local network, which works together with existing GPS system. Originality. A mathematical model for calculating the motion curves and energy consumption of electric vehicles has been developed. This model takes into account the characteristic values of the motor engine and the steering system, the change of the mass when loading or unloading passengers, the slopes and radii of the roads, the limitations given by the general traffic rules, and other factors. The dependency of the energy consumption on the averaged monthly environment temperature for public electric transport companies has been calculated. Practical value. The developed mathematical model simplifies the calculations of the traffic dynamics and energy consumption. It can be used for calculating the routing maps, for design and upgrade of the power networks, for development of the electricity saving measures. The system simplifies the work of the vehicle driver and allows reducing the energy consumption, also provides for an automatic energy cost monitoring. The calculated dependency of the energy consumption on the environment temperature may be used for an improvement of methods which regulate the work of the public electric transport companies. It has been proved that there is a possibility for reducing electrical energy consumption by 10 % to 45 % using the efficient motion regimes.

30|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, {{automatic}} <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{began to be}} used in warehouse automation and factory operations, and Japan began to introduce automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology from then on. In the mid- 1970 s, due to the application of integrated circuit technology and electronic technology in automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> were significantly improved in terms of automation and control performance. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> entered the production system as a production component and has also been rapidly developed [1]. During this period, European companies standardized the size and structure of pallets for containers, which accelerated the development of automated transport technology in Europe [2]. The first International Conference on Unmanned Pallets was held in June 1981 in London, England, which has shown a breakthrough in the technology of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> [3]. In 1984, General Motors first tried an automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> on their flexible assembly system. Two years later, the number of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> increased to 1407, making it the world’s largest automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> user [4]. In 1985, due to the development of computer microprocessors and the rise of control technology, computer communication and identification technology entered the field of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> developed toward intelligence [5]. In 1987, it was reported that Sweden first used automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the field of logistics systems in 1969 [6]. In 1974, the Swedish Volvo Car Company applied automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> to their car assembly lines. This improvement has been a huge success, not only reducing labor, assembly time, and assembly failures, but also speeding up capital flow by 43 % [7]. Many Western European countries have followed suit because of the practical economic benefits of this application. In the 1980 s, the wave of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Europe flooded into the US market. Many US companies transferred advanced automatic guided trolley technology to Metron through technology introduction and joint ventures ([8]. In 1978, a direct computer-controlled automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> system introduced from Europe was successfully applied at the Keebler Distribution Center in Chicago, USA [9]. In 1981, John Corporation of the USA applied automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> to automated warehouses to increase the efficiency of material handling during manufacturing, and the entire process was monitored in real time [10]. The French outdoor guide automatic transporter runs at speeds of up to 97 [*]km/h [11]. In the following 10 [*]years, various intelligent automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> have emerged in an endless stream. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on visual navigation have also been greatly developed. At this time, the typical visual navigation system mainly includes ARCADE system of the University of Michigan; LANA system [12]; NAVLAB system of Carnegie Mellon University, USA; EMS, Vision system of German Federal University of Defense; ROMA system of IITB of Germany; and PVS system of MITI of Japan. According to statistics, by 2004, there were more than 16, 000 automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> systems in use worldwide and more than 100, 000 automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> [13].|$|R

In the late 1980 s, the Beijing Machinery Industry Automation Research Institute developed the first automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{that can be used}} in the three-dimensional warehouse and successfully applied in the Second Automobile Group. During the same period, the Beijing Postal Research Institute also successfully developed the Automated Guided Car IV [15] using two-way wireless communication technology. In the 1990 s, China’s research on automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> entered a period of rapid development. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> imported from abroad was successfully applied to the CIMS experimental research at the National CIMS Engineering Center of Tsinghua University. Shenyang Institute of Automation developed an automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> for automobile engine assembly for Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd., which is a successful application in China’s automobile industry [16]. Kunming Marine Equipment Research Institute successfully developed an automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on laser/infrared guidance for the first time. The Intelligent Vehicles Group of Jilin University is mainly engaged in the research of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on visual navigation.

50|$|According to a {{study by}} Drs. Van Dyne and Raymer for the Tennessee Valley Authority, the average US farm consumes fuel at the rate of 82 litres per hectare (8.75 US gal/acre) of land to produce one crop. However, average crops of {{rapeseed}} produce oil at an average rate of 1,029 L/ha (110 US gal/acre), and high-yield rapeseed fields produce about 1,356 L/ha (145 US gal/acre). The ratio of input to output in these cases is roughly 1:12.5 and 1:16.5. Photosynthesis is known to have an efficiency rate of about 3-6% of total solar radiationand if the entire mass of a crop is utilized for energy production, the overall efficiency of this chain is currently about 1% While this may compare unfavorably to solar cells combined with an electric drive train, biodiesel is less costly to deploy (solar cells cost approximately US$250 per square meter) and <b>transport</b> (<b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> require batteries which currently have a much lower energy density than liquid fuels).
