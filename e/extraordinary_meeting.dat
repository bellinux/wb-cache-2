5|$|Cisneros called Saavedra and Martín Rodríguez, and {{requested}} their military {{support in the}} case of a popular rebellion. They refused to give such support, and Saavedra argued that Cisneros should resign because the Junta of Seville that had appointed him did not exist anymore. As a result, Cisneros gave in to the request of Juan José Castelli: to celebrate an open cabildo, an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the noteworthy peoples of the city, and discuss the situation. The next day an armed mob, led by Antonio Beruti and Domingo French, occupied the Plaza to demand the making of the open cabildo, doubting that Cisneros would actually allow it. Saavedra addressed the crowd and assured them that the Regiment of Patricians supported their claims.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Álzaga began a mutiny {{to remove}} Liniers. On January1, 1809, an open cabildo (an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of vecinos, {{prominent}} {{people of the}} city) chaired by Álzaga demanded the resignation of Liniers and {{the appointment of a}} local junta. The Spanish militia and a group of people summoned by the meeting gathered to support the rebellion. A small number of criollos, notably Mariano Moreno, supported the mutiny, but most of them did not. They felt that Álzaga wanted to remove the Viceroy to avoid his political authority while keeping the social differences between criollos and peninsulars unchanged. The riot was quickly routed when criollo militias led by Cornelio Saavedra surrounded the plaza and dispersed the insurgents. As a result of the failed mutiny, the rebel militias were disarmed. This included all peninsular militias, {{and the power of the}} criollos increased as a result. The leaders of the plot, with the exception of Moreno, were exiled to Carmen de Patagones. Javier de Elío freed them and gave them political asylum at Montevideo.|$|E

Existing investors now took this up.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of its President Manuel Zelaya, Honduras' membership of the Organization was suspended unanimously at midnight on 5 July 2009. The de facto government had already announced it was leaving the OAS hours earlier; this was not, however, taken into account by the OAS, which does not recognize that government as legitimate. An <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> had been conducted by the OAS in Washington, D.C., with Zelaya in attendance. The suspension of Honduras was approved unanimously with 33 votes (Honduras did not vote). This was the first suspension {{carried out by the}} OAS since that of Cuba in 1962.|$|E

25|$|Unnerved by {{the poor}} results, the {{directors}} called an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> to gauge the players' feelings about the new manager and his methods. Some players, such as Allan Clarke and Johnny Giles, recognised the need to rebuild Revie's ageing side, and thought Clough should be given more time. Others – notably Paul Madeley – felt differently, and said so during the meeting. Shortly after, an emergency board meeting was held, and in September 1974 Clough was sacked after only 44 days in charge. Clough went on to greater things with Nottingham Forest; of his signings for Leeds, only Duncan McKenzie flourished at the club.|$|E

25|$|On 21 August 1679, {{the king}} fell ill, leading Essex and Halifax (who feared Monmouth {{was about to}} launch a coup) to ask the Duke of York, whom Charles had sent to Brussels in late 1678, to return to England. Charles soon {{recovered}} and then ordered both York and Monmouth into exile. When Charles agreed to allow his brother to move from Flanders to Scotland in October 1679, Shaftesbury summoned an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the privy council to discuss the Duke's move, acting on his own authority as Lord President of the Council because the king was at Newmarket at the time. Angered by this insubordination, Charles removed Shaftesbury from the privy council on 14 October 1679.|$|E

25|$|Following his arrest, the United States {{pressured}} the Yugoslav government to extradite Milošević to the ICTY or lose financial {{aid from the}} IMF and World Bank.

Milošević's lawyers appealed the extradition process to the Yugoslav Constitutional Court. The court requested 2 weeks to deliberate the appeal. Ignoring objections from the president and the constitutional court, Đinđić ordered the extradition of Milošević to the ICTY. On 28 June, Milošević was flown by helicopter from Belgrade to the U.S. air base in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina from where he was then flown to The Hague, Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|For the 1997 Formula One season, the {{increased}} {{reliability of the}} F310B enabled Ferrari to challenge for its first Drivers' Championship since Jody Scheckter had won Ferrari's last Drivers' title 18 years earlier, in 1979. Michael Schumacher finished on the podium eight times {{during the course of}} the season, including five wins, and went into the final round leading Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve by one point. On Lap 48 of the final round of the 1997 season, the 1997 European Grand Prix at Jerez, Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve collided as the latter attempted to overtake for the race lead down the inside of the Dry Sac corner. Schumacher retired from the race, and Villeneuve clinched the 1997 Drivers' Championship with a third-place finish. The stewards of the event had initially deemed the collision a racing incident. However, Schumacher was then summoned and disqualified from the 1997 World Drivers' Championship for unsportsmanlike conduct in an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the FIA World Motor Sport Council on 11 November 1997. Ferrari's Constructors' Championship points, however, remained intact, and the team finished second overall. Eddie Irvine, having scored five podiums throughout the season, was classified seventh in the Drivers' standings.|$|E

500|$|Reading {{supporters}} marched {{from the}} town centre to Elm Park in protest against the merger before the team's match against Millwall on 30 April. Two days later, Oxford and Reading met at Manor Road in what the Glasgow Herald commented might be [...] "the last Thames Valley derby". Oxford fans held another protest march before the game, which Reading won 2–1. At the High Court on 3 May, Mr Justice Harman sided with Tranter and Smee, and handed down a new injunction forbidding trading in Reading stock until 13 June 1983. Following a Reading board meeting on 12 May, Waller, Davies and Briggs resigned their positions, and returned the disputed unissued shares to the club. The Reading Evening Post saw this {{as the end of}} the episode, and jubilantly bannered the news across its front page on 13 May: [...] "We've won! Merger off". The next day, Reading played Wrexham at home on the last day of the League season, needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division; they won 1–0, but still went down because of results elsewhere. The club held an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of shareholders in July 1983, at which a vote was taken to decide between Maxwell's takeover bid and a rival offer from Smee, supported by Tranter. The latter proposition narrowly won, and Smee took over as chairman of Reading, putting an end to the planned merger.|$|E
