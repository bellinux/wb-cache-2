60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> letter. As soon as I had {{recovered}} myself, I looked at it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{second of}} the two books which he had by him on the table.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{went to the}} telephone. Mechanically <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{additional}} receiver. He {{asked for}} a number and presently received a reply.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] he says, [...] "I am {{a priest}} in spite of myself, but they call me Bishop now. Take this for my episcopal blessing," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
6000|$|He {{picked up}} his book from the table, and took his pencil out of Cristel's hand, while we were speaking. [...] "I want my answer," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> book and the pencil. I gave him his answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is even a}} rougher {{place than}} my gallery to receive a lady in," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "but I know Miss Summerson will {{make the best of}} it." [...] As <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> to <b>the</b> bench on which he had been sitting, I sat down, which seemed to give him great satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> slip {{of paper}} which had marked the place in the book. It {{contained}} a few lines of writing, as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> paper. I must {{own that}} the figures startled me. I laid {{it down with}} a fine show of indifference.|$|E
60|$|Umbopa {{rose to the}} occasion, {{and with}} {{something}} as nearly resembling a grin as I have ever seen on his dignified face <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> gun.|$|E
60|$|Now, if <b>he</b> had <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> rod, {{and then}} taken another boat and gone home, perhaps I {{might have known}} {{what to do with}} the thing after a while, but I must say that at that minute I didn't. I held the rod out over the water and let the flies dangle down into it, but do what I would, they wouldn't sink; there wasn't weight enough on them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we got there, and I breezed up to {{the desk}} and said to the clerk, 'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?' Saaaay! You'd 'a' thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! <b>He</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and he ducks behind the rigamajig they {{keep track of the}} rooms on. Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was all right--he {{certainly}} took long enough--or maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him, and croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.' 'Well, that's awful nice of you--sorry to trouble you--how much 'll it set me back?' I says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,' he says.|$|R
60|$|He {{made some}} excuse, but I saw {{through it and}} insisted, and at last <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> one of <b>the</b> discs of {{polished}} silver set in a wooden frame like a hand-screen, which serve as looking-glasses in Zu-Vendis. I looked and put it down.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> circular. My heart {{gave one}} violent throb the instant I looked at it. I felt myself turn pale; I felt my knees {{trembling}} under me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} {{moderate}} in your demands," [...] {{he said as}} <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> cheque which I put in my pocket, reflecting that it would just pay for my son's operation.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> open book. I {{started as}} I {{looked at the}} picture. In this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was {{certainly}} a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist.|$|E
60|$|I {{left him}} {{full of the}} image of this {{magnificent}} intellect babbling like a foolish child. <b>He</b> had <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> key, and with a happy thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in <b>the</b> passage. Behind <b>me</b> as I passed from the flat I heard Holmes's high, thin voice in some delirious chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on <b>me</b> through <b>the</b> fog.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{what he told}} me," [...] his vis-a-vis continued, handing again his cigarette-case, {{and looking}} {{steadily}} into the fire, [...] "he seems to have left England with the secret determination never to return. But why I do not know. One thing is certain. His mental state was not altogether healthy. His desire for solitude was almost a passion. Towards the end, however, his mind was clear enough. He told me about your mother and you, and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> all <b>the</b> papers, which I subsequently sent to London. He spoke of no trouble, and his transition was quite peaceful." ...|$|R
60|$|Why, I {{recollect}} {{the early}} days of my writing career, when the small sums of money I earned from the magazines came with tragic irregularity, {{while at the same time}} I was staggering along with a growing family--a wife, children, a mother, a nephew, and my Mammy Jennie and her old husband fallen on evil days. There were two places at which I could borrow money; a barber shop and a saloon. <b>The</b> barber charged <b>me</b> five per cent. per month in advance. That is to say, when I borrowed one hundred dollars, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> ninety-five. <b>The</b> other five dollars he retained as advance interest for the first month. And on the second month I paid him five dollars more, and continued so to do each month until I made a ten strike with the editors and lifted the loan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Davy," [...] said Colonel Clark, [...] "we {{have had}} enough of {{predictions}} for the present. Fetch this letter to Captain Bowman at the garrison up the street." [...] <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> letter. [...] "Are you afraid of the Indians?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{letter and}} walked to the fireplace, where he took snuff copiously, while Alain eyed him like a mastiff about to spring. I broke open my letter and stooped to pick up a small {{enclosure}} which fell from it.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{maps and}} was gone. I have them today, and if ever {{this book is}} published, they will appear with it, {{that those who are}} {{qualified}} may judge of them and of the truth or otherwise of Oro's words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if Providence {{comes forward}} and insists on {{taking charge of}} a man, it is hardly good manners to flout her. Besides, his wife's {{portrait}} is worth {{twice as much as}} he is paying for it. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> over <b>the</b> money in notes. 'Things not going quite smoothly with you just at the moment?' he asked <b>me.</b> 'Oh, about <b>the</b> same as usual,' I told him. 'You won't be offended at my taking it away with me this evening?' he asked. 'Not in the least,' I answered; 'you'll get it {{on the top of a}} four-wheeled cab.' We called in a couple of men, and I helped them down with it, and confoundedly heavy it was. 'I shall send round to Jong's for the other half on Monday morning,' he said, speaking with his head through the cab window, 'and explain it to him.' 'Do,' I answered; 'he'll understand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> back <b>the</b> empty cup. [...] "I believe, sir, {{you have}} saved my life," [...] he said. [...] "Under Providence," [...] I put in--adding, [...] "But I would remark, {{looking to the}} state of your clothes, that I have yet another service to offer you, before you tell us how you came into this pitiable state." [...] With that reply, I led him upstairs, and set before him the poor {{resources}} of my wardrobe, and left him to do the best he could with them. He was rather a small man, and I am in stature nigh on six feet. When he came down to us in my clothes, we had the merriest evening that I can remember for years past. I thought Felicia would have had a hysteric fit; and even sister Judith laughed--he did look such a comical figure in the minister's garments.|$|R
6000|$|Mr Meagles bestirred {{himself with}} such prompt {{activity}} {{in the matter of}} the negotiation with Daniel Doyce which Clennam had entrusted to him, that he soon brought it into business train, and called on Clennam at nine o'clock one morning to make his report. 'Doyce is highly gratified by your good opinion,' he opened the business by saying, 'and desires nothing so much as that you should examine the affairs of the Works for yourself, and entirely understand them. <b>He</b> has <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> keys of all his books and papers--here they are jingling in this pocket--and the only charge he has given me is [...] "Let Mr Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me as to knowing whatever I know. If it should come to nothing after all, he will respect my confidence. Unless I was sure of that to begin with, I should {{have nothing to do with}} him." [...] And there, you see,' said Mr Meagles, 'you have Daniel Doyce all over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that'll {{make it all}} right," [...] he said, and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{letter to}} read. It was a {{strictly}} business letter. No nonsense about the folks at home. He said that {{was the kind of}} business letter his father liked. It ran like this: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess they'll turn up presently. I couldn't {{tell your}} father {{that because there}} were other folks in the store when <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> notice. What I {{want to say is}} that he's not wise in bluffing the boys. You had better tell him that's my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> open pocket-book. The {{address on}} the letter {{was the first thing}} copied. It was all written in one paragraph, without any attempt at punctuation, thus: [...] "To the three Indian men living with the lady called Macann at Frizinghall in Yorkshire." [...] The Hindoo {{characters}} followed; and the English translation appeared at the end, expressed in these mysterious words: ...|$|E
6000|$|At length I heard {{footsteps}} and shut my eyes, for I could bear {{the sight of}} that dreadful knife no longer. But behold! no knife fell. Suddenly my hands were loosed and I was lifted to my feet, on which I never hoped to stand again. Then I was borne {{to the edge of}} the teocalli, for I could not walk, and here my would-be murderer, the priest, having first shouted some words to the spectators below, that caused them to murmur like a forest when the wind stirs it, clasped me in his blood-stained arms and kissed <b>me</b> on <b>the</b> forehead. Now it was for the first time that I noticed my captor, the cacique, standing at my side, grave, courteous, and smiling. As he had smiled when <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> to <b>the</b> pabas, so he smiled when he took me back from them. Then having been cleansed and clothed, I was led into the sanctuary of the god Quetzal and stood face to face with the hideous image there, staring at the golden censer that was to have received my heart while the priests uttered prayers. Thence I was supported down the winding road of the pyramid till I came to its foot, where my captor <b>the</b> cacique took <b>me</b> by <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> and led <b>me</b> through <b>the</b> people who, it seemed, now regarded me with some strange veneration. The first person that I saw when we reached the house was Marina, who looked at me and murmured some soft words that I could not understand. Then I was suffered to go to my chamber, and there I passed the rest of the day prostrated by all that I had undergone. Truly I had come to a land of devils! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sent by the}} Vladika, who {{pressed on}} me that I was not to lose a single instant in seeing you; that time is of golden price--nay, beyond price. This letter, amongst other things, vouches for me. A terrible misfortune has occurred. The {{daughter}} of our leader has disappeared during last night--the same, he commanded me to remind you, that he spoke of at the meeting when he would not let the mountaineers fire their guns. No sign of her can be found, and {{it is believed that}} she has been carried off by the emissaries of the Sultan of Turkey, who once before brought our nations to the verge of war by demanding her as a wife. I was also to say that the Vladika Plamenac would have come himself, but that it was necessary that he should at once consult with the Archbishop, Stevan Palealogue, as to what step is best to take in this dire calamity. He has sent out a search-party under the Archimandrite of Spazac, Petrof Vlastimir, who is to come on here with any news he can get, as you have command of the signalling, and can best spread the news. He knows that you, Gospodar, are in your great heart one of our compatriots, and that you have already proved your friendship by many efforts to strengthen our hands for war. And as a great compatriot, he calls on you to aid us in our need." [...] <b>He</b> then <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> letter, and stood by respectfully whilst I broke the seal and read it. It was written in great haste, and signed by the Vladika.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{a letter}} {{addressed}} {{to me in}} Oscar's handwriting.|$|R
6000|$|He put on {{the coffin}} lid again, {{gathered}} up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us {{he closed the door}} and locked it. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> key, saying, [...] "Will you keep it? You had better be assured." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the stove}} was lighted we drank green tea and ate more flapjacks which Harry had badly burned. I {{remember}} that when <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> first cup he said, [...] "We haven't got champagne, and we don't want whiskey, {{but this is a}} great day for both of us. Well, here's luck to the plowing and increase to the seed, and, whether it's success or failure, what we have started we'll see through together!" ...|$|E
60|$|During {{carnival}} {{a company}} is playing in the theatre. On Christmas Day the padrone came in with the key of his box, and would we care to see the drama? The theatre was small, a mere nothing, in fact; a mere affair of peasants, you understand; and the Signor Di Paoli spread his hands and put his head on one side, parrot-wise; but we might find a little diversion--un peu de divertiment. With this <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> key.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> some {{drops and}} salve {{and told me}} to treat myself.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, Mr. Bruff {{surprised}} <b>me</b> at <b>the</b> breakfast-table. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a large key, {{and announced}} that he felt ashamed of himself {{for the first time}} in his life.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a small sketch-book, and, while I {{turned over}} the leaves, busied himself in filling a short meerschaum.|$|R
