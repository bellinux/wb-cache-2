40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel {{bio-inspired}} static image compression scheme. Our {{model is a}} combination of a simplified spiking retina model and well known data compression techniques. The fundamental hypothesis behind this work is that the mammalian retina generates an efficient neural code associated to the visual flux. The main novelty of this work is to show how this neural code can be exploited in the context of still image compression. Our model has three main stages. The first stage is the bio-inspired retina model proposed by Thorpe et al [1, 2], which transforms an image into a wave of spikes. This transform is based on the so-called rank order coding. In the second stage, we show how this wave of spikes can be expressed using a 4 -ary dictionary alphabet, through a stack run coder. The third stage consists of applying a first order arithmetic coder to the stack run coded signal. We compare our results to JPEG standards and we show that our model has comparable performance for lower computational cost under strong bit rate restrictions when data is highly contaminated with noise. In addition, our model offers scalability for monitoring <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>flow.</b> The subject matter presented highlights a variety of important issues in the conception of novel bio-inspired compression schemes and additionally presents many potential avenues for future research efforts...|$|R
40|$|The western {{extension}} of the World Health Organization (WHO) project to combat onchocerciasis (river blindness), mainly in Guinea, calls for realtime access to flow level data concerning the rivers to be treated. The correct amount of larvicide to be applied, {{as a function of}} flow, can thus be calculated. The Argos system was chosen for <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> The transmitter is connected to water depth measurement hardware produced by Elsyde and CEIS-Espace and designed around a relative piezoelectric sensor and an EPROM-based data storage unit. This unit stores the hydrometric data and transmits messages containing the last 15 water depth measurements made on the hour and half-hour. The direct readout station contains a microcomputer which inputs data to the hydrometric data bank in realtime and is itself connected to a second microcomputer. This converts water depths into flow terms and makes a prediction, either by correlation or by inter-station analysis, of the flow at each relevant position over the coming five or ten hours. It also calculates the concentration of insecticide to apply to each stretch of the river.

40|$|Embedding data-aggregation {{capabilities}} into sensor nodes {{of wireless}} networks could save energy by reducing redundant <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Existing research describes {{the construction of}} data aggregation trees to maximize data aggregation times {{in order to reduce}} <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> of redundant <b>data.</b> However, aggregation of more nodes on the same node will incur significant collisions. These MAC (Media Access Control) layer collisions introduce additional data retransmissions that could jeopardize the advantages of data aggregation. This paper is the first to consider the energy consumption tradeoffs between data aggregation and retransmissions in a wireless sensor network. By using the existing CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) MAC protocol, the retransmission energy consumption function is well formulated. This paper proposes a novel non-linear mathematical formulation, whose function is to minimize the total energy consumption of <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> subject to <b>data</b> aggregation trees and data retransmissions.

By assuming a turbulence driven by an external forcing with both helical and non-helical spectra, we investigate the combined effect of these two shears on turbulence intensity and turbulent transport represented by turbulent diffusivities (turbulent viscosity, α and β effect) in analogy with Reynolds. We show that turbulence viscosity and diffusivity are quenched for strong <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> and magnetic field in the limits of weak and strong magnetic field, respectively. For a weak <b>flow</b> <b>shear,</b> we further show that the magnetic shear increases the turbulence intensity while decreasing the turbulent transport.

The {{relative importance of}} equilibrium <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> and magnetic shear in their formation and evolution is investigated using data from high-resolution kinetic- and q-profile diagnostics. In L-mode plasmas, with co-current directed NBI heating, ITBs in the momentum and ion thermal channels form in the negative shear region just inside qmin. In the ITB region the anomalous ion thermal transport is suppressed, with ion thermal transport close to the neo-classical level, although the electron transport remains anomalous. Linear stability analysis with the gyro-kinetic code GS 2 shows that all electrostatic micro-instabilities are stable in the negative magnetic shear region in the core, both with and without <b>flow</b> <b>shear.</b> Outside the ITB, {{in the region of}} positive magnetic shear and relatively weak <b>flow</b> <b>shear,</b> electrostatic micro-instabilities become unstable over a wide range of wave numbers. <b>Flow</b> <b>shear</b> reduces the linear growth rates of low-k modes but suppression of ITG modes is incomplete, which is consistent with the observed anomalous ion transport in this region; however, <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> has little impact on growth rates of high-k, electron-scale modes.

Perpendicular <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> convects perturbations along the field at the speed we denote as Mc_s (where c_s is the sound speed).

40|$|Roughness {{elements}} at {{the soil}} surface (e. g. crop residues, rock fragments, vegetation, geotextiles) strongly reduce the erosivity of overland flow (both interrill and concentrated overland flow) and hence soil detachment rates. Common methods for shear stress partitioning that allow the calculation of effective <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> stress {{in the presence of}} roughness elements originate from river hydraulics but seem invalid for overland flow. An alternative method to estimate the effective <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> stress {{in the presence of a}} soil surface cover has been presented and tested for soil detachment by concentrated runoff on soil surfaces covered by crop residues by Knapen et al., (2008). In this method, the estimation of effective <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> stress is based on the recalculation of the hydraulic radius for covered soil surfaces using flow hydraulics on uncovered surfaces. However, the applicability of this method for roughness elements different from crop residues and under field conditions needs to be tested to confirm its validity. Therefore, runoff data from three experimental studies (conducted on geotextile and grassed-covered soil surfaces) are analysed in this study. The results show that effective <b>flow</b> <b>shear</b> stress, calculated using this method, is not only a good soil detachment predictor for soil surfaces covered with crop residues but also for the tested soil surfaces with a vegetation or geotextile cover. However, the geotextile experiments point to one of the shortcomings of the method.
