25|$|The {{methods of}} {{manufacturing}} polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, high-volume bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, {{wait until it}} cures, then demold the <b>finished</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
25|$|When done in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the <b>finished</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the four-slide machine {{is its ability to}} complete all of the operations required to form the workpiece from start to finish. Moreover, it can handle certain parts that transfer or progressive dies cannot, because it can manipulate from four axes. Due to this flexibility it reduces the cost of the <b>finished</b> <b>part</b> because it requires less machines, setups, and handling. Also, because only one machine is required, less space is required for any given workpiece. As compared to standard stamping presses the tooling is usually inexpensive, due to the simplicity of the tools. A four-slide can usually produce 20,000 to 70,000 finished parts per 16-hour shift, depending on the number of operations per part; this speed usually results in a lower cost per part.|$|E
25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a <b>finished</b> <b>part.</b> Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
2500|$|Cutting is a {{collection}} of processes wherein material is brought to a specified geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a <b>finished</b> <b>part</b> that meets specifications.

2500|$|Upset forging {{is usually}} done in special {{high-speed}} machines called crank presses. The machines are usually {{set up to}} work in the horizontal plane, to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next, but upsetting can also be done in a vertical crank press or a hydraulic press. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to [...] in diameter and a capacity of over 1000 tons. The standard upsetting machine employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilized on every cycle, then a <b>finished</b> <b>part</b> will be produced with every cycle, which makes this process advantageous for mass production.|$|E
2500|$|To raise money, Southey and Coleridge {{began to}} work {{together}} in August 1794. According to Southey the project began in [...] "sportive conversation" [...] at the house of their friend Robert Lovell. The three intended to collaborate on a play that would deal with the beheading of Robespierre in July 1794. Their source was news articles that described the final moments of a dispute within the National Assembly. During composition, they were able to write 800 lines in just two days. The play was divided between the three collaborators, with Coleridge composing the first act, Southey composing the second act and Lovell the third. Southey and Lovell completed their acts but Coleridge had only <b>finished</b> <b>part</b> of his the following evening. Southey felt that Lowell's contribution was not [...] "in keeping" [...] and so rewrote the third act himself. Coleridge completed his act. When they turned to Joseph Cottle to publish the work, he refused and Coleridge had to search for another publisher. He took the manuscript to Cambridge, revising and improving his own contribution. Eventually, the work was published in October 1794 by Benjamin Flower. Five hundred copies were printed and circulated in Bath, Cambridge, and London, which brought the writers fame while their personal relationship grew tense.|$|E

Extrusion dies use extremely high pressure from the punch to squeeze the metal out into the desired form. The difference between cold forming and extrusion is extruded parts do not take shape of the punch.|$|R
50|$|A common {{method of}} working {{is to start}} with a {{prototype}} model and produce smooth mathematical Class A surfaces to describe the product's outer body.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new {{mechanism for the}} coordination of multi-stage manufacturing systems. This mechanism is called the Extended Kanban Control System (EKCS) and depends on two parameters per stage, the number of kanbans and the base stock of <b>finished</b> <b>parts.</b> The EKCS {{is a combination of}} the classical Kanban and Base Stock control systems and includes each system as a special case. The dynamics of the EKCS are described, in particular, in relation to the dynamics of the Generalized Kanban Control System (GKCS), a known control mechanism that also includes the Kanban and Base Stock control systems as special cases. Advantages of the EKCS over the GKCS are discussed. Finally, properties of the dynamics of the EKCS are presented. One important property is that the capacity of the EKCS depends only on the number of kanbans but not on the base stock of <b>finished</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|R

50|$|Benchtop {{injectors}} {{are smaller}} and simpler than their larger commercial counterparts because {{they rely on}} the operator to manually inject melted polymer into the mold and remove the <b>finished</b> <b>part</b> from the mold. Production injectors automatically inject melted polymer at a prescribed rate into the mold, cool the mold to rapidly solidify the polymer, then eject the part from the mold once it's cool. The two halves of the mold must be pressed together with great force to prevent a defect in the part where the two halves meet, and the nozzle of the injector must be pressed tightly against the inlet port of the mold to prevent the escape of melted polymer and again a defect in the <b>finished</b> <b>part.</b> In a benchtop injector this is done manually by clamping or bolting the mold together and clamping the complete mold into the injector. In a production injector this is accomplished with hydraulic or pneumatic actuators, which increase {{the cost of the}} machine but dramatically reduce the labor required to produce a <b>finished</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
