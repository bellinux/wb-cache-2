This model assumes that higher excited manifolds in an activator <b>de-excite</b> primarily by phonon-mediated sequential relaxation to lower energy manifolds in the same activator ion. In addition to sequential relaxation, there appears to be strong coupling between activators, which results in energy transfer interactions. Some of these interactions negatively impact phosphor efficiency by nonradiatively <b>de-exciting</b> activators. Increasing activator concentration enhances these interactions.

Reactions of ^(64) Ni+^(64) Ni, ^(64) Zn+^(64) Zn, and ^(70) Zn+^(70) Zn were investigated at the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute using the NIMROD-ISiS array to collect the data. The same reactions were simulated using anti-symmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD), constrained molecular dynamics (CoMD), and GEMINI, a statistical decay model, used as an afterburner for the dynamical models. The dynamical models were studied at time-steps, or maximum times, of 300 fm/c and 3000 fm/c. In the AMD simulations, GEMINI was applied at 300 fm/c to <b>de-excite</b> the system. The fragment distributions and isoscaling exhibit a dependence on the time-step of the simulation, due to the differences in de-excitation of the system, {{as well as the}} E_(sym) of the interactions in AMD and CoMD.

The fragment distributions showed a dependence on the time-step of the simulation as well as the E_(sym) of the simulations. The isoscaling also exhibited both time and Esym dependence in the simulations. The dependence on isoscaling with time is not affected by the use of GEMINI as an afterburner, as compared to allowing the system to <b>de-excite</b> dynamically.
