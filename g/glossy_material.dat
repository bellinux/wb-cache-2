40|$|Computation {{of global}} {{illumination}} {{is an important}} means {{in the pursuit of}} photorealism of computer-generated images. It is of particular importance in scenes with glossy surfaces, since it conditions correct perception of <b>glossy</b> <b>material</b> characteristics. This dissertation focuses on efficient computation of global illumination in presence of glossy surfaces with low-frequency reflectance functions. Computing global illumination on those surfaces is difficult with pure Monte Carlo sampling because of the sheer number of rays required to get a good estimate of indirect illumination. We propose radiance caching, a ray tracing-based algorithm for computing indirect illumination on glossy surfaces with low-frequency reflectance functions. The algorithm takes advantage of the shading smoothness on these surfaces by interpolating indirect illumination from a set of sparsely distributed, cached values. We discuss all the components necessary for an implementation of radiance caching: (1) an automatic choice of surfaces on which radiance caching is used; (2) compact representation for the cached illumination by spherical harmonics; (3) efficient spherical harmonics rotation that makes interpolation possible; (4...|$|E

The approach {{is based on}} new results derived for non-linear phase shifting in the Haar wavelet domain. Although image-based methods for real-time rendering of dynamic glossy objects have been proposed, they do not truly scale to all possible frequencies and high sampling rates without trading storage, glossiness, or computational time, while varying both lighting and viewpoint. This {{is due to the}} fact that current approaches are limited to precomputed radiance transfer (PRT), which is prohibitively expensive in terms of memory requirements and real-time rendering when both varying light and viewpoint changes are required together with high sampling rates for high frequency lighting of <b>glossy</b> <b>material.</b> On the other hand, current methods cannot handle object rotation, which is one of the paramount issues for all PRT methods using wavelets. This latter problem arises because the precomputed data are defined in a global coordinate system and encoded in the wavelet domain, while the object is rotated in a local coordinate system. At the root of all the above problems is the lack of efficient run-time solution to the nontrivial problem of rotating wavelets (a non-linear phase-shift), which we solve in this paper...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{work on the}} {{perception}} of glossy materials has mostly focused on two dimensions: gloss strength and microscale roughness. However, more advanced reflectance models often include additional parameters for controlling the distribution of reflected light. It remains unknown whether these additional dimensions have a perceptually significant influence on appearance. In particular, among the six types of gloss suggested by Hunter in his seminal book (Hunter, 1975), “haze” remains among the less studied of potentially pertinent material cues. From a physical point of view, hazy reflections are associated with heavy-tailed, or leptokurtic, reflectance functions, as often occurs in semi-polished metals or coated materials. We have investigated gloss haze by rendering movies of irregularly shaped objects made of metallic materials exhibiting more or lessleptokurtic reflectance functions. We modeled hazy metals using a two-layered <b>glossy</b> <b>material</b> model with two centered Gaussian-like lobes (Ward, 1992) of different spread. Varying both the (1) relative spread and (2) relative magnitude of the two lobes yielded a 5 x 5 array of different materials. Subjects rated the following qualities for each material: glossiness, blurriness, haziness, coatedness, polish, and friction. Principal component analysis of the results reveals that haziness is a distinct visual dimension orthogonal to the commonly studied glossiness and blurriness. Coatedness appears to be nearly synonymous with haziness, as {{this is one of}} the main physical causes of haze in real world materials. Polish seems to be a combination of glossiness and haziness, as materials go from dull to hazy to highly glossy during the physical polishing process. The inferred tactile quality of friction is apparently uncorrelated with haziness. Our results demonstrate that haze is indeed a distinct perceptual dimension of gloss, which is systematically related to the kurtosis of the specular lobe...|$|E

This paper proposes a new method for rendering screen-space glossy to glossy reflections in realtime. We use spherical von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions to model glossy BRDFs at surfaces, and employ screen space directional occlusion (SSDO) rendering framework to trace indirect light transports bounced in the screen space. As our main contributions, we derive a new parameterization of vMF distribution so as to convert the non-linear fit of multiple vMF distributions into a linear sum in the new space. Then, we present a new linear filtering technique to build MIP-maps on glossy BRDFs, which allows us to create filtered radiance transfer functions at runtime, and efficiently estimate indirect glossy to glossy reflections. We demonstrate our method in a realtime application for rendering scenes with dynamic glossy objects.

In computer graphics research the focus has shifted to applying these well-known techniques on the graphics processing unit (GPU), which has evolved recently into a massively parallel general-purpose computing unit. This allows to generate realistic images interactively (multiple frames per second). This dissertation describes methods for creating photorealistic images interactively for scenes which contain <b>glossy</b> <b>materials,</b> such as shiny metals or plastics. The blurry reflections -typical for glossy materials- pose a significant challenge to known methods. The techniques proposed in this work provide solutions to this challenge and differ in terms of rendering speed, memory cost, preprocessing time {{and the quality of the}} resulting images. First of all we present a method for visualizing indirect highlights, which are formed by at least two glossy reflections between the camera and the light source. We show the difficulties from which known techniques suffer when computing such highlights and propose to compute a filtered response function to alleviate them. As a result we obtain faithful glossy reflections at near-interactive frame rates. Our method requires no preprocessing. We compare our results with ground-truth references and discuss possible sources of error. The remainder of this work discusses Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods, which require preprocessing. PRT methods compute a transfer function on the surface of the scene. We demonstrate how to perform this computation adaptively, in order to focus calculations in regions where glossy reflections are to be expected. Our results run at interactive frame rates, at the expense of memory cost and preprocessing time. Finally we present a method to decrease both this preprocessing time and memory cost. The former by computing the transfer function iteratively, the latter by exploiting the sparsity of our transfer function representation.
