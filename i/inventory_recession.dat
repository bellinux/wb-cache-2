40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to present and examine the 1940 {{contemporary}} explanations of the downturn or the “recession” of 1937. Primarily {{the purpose was to}} isolate factors that this downturn had in common with other downturns, to determine factors that are peculiar to it alone, to find where it fits and where it does not fit business cycle theories, and to add to the general store of information about business cycles. It is also hoped that the study may help in “doing something about depressions” and to offer a method of possible control to possibly ensure that the next depression could be partly ironed out, the boom prevented, and a sharp decline avoided. Government spending is discussed in the first chapter. Chapter II, which treats of money and credit conditions, is organized around Federal Reserve policy—of special interest because the Board of Governors at the time raised reserve requirements for the first since the inauguration of the system. The movement of prices is discussed in the next chapter, which emphasizes the boom and collapse of stock prices and the rather unusual boom and collapse in commodity prices. In the chapter on investment the writer discusses the “capital strike”—a term heard often during the period. Chapter V is devoted to consumption in light of frequent references made to a “consumption recovery. ” Chapter VI discusses the course of production and the inventory situation—“the <b>inventory</b> <b>recession.</b> ” In the conclusion, the various explanations are evaluated and the summary of the thesis is related to some aspects of business cycle theories, forecasting and control.

40|$|The 1950 s {{have often}} been {{characterized}} as a period outstanding only for its banality, when {{the head of state}} 2 ̆ 2 preferred golf to government 2 ̆ 2 (p. I). Historians have reconstructed Dwight Eisenhower 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style but have given scant attention to the evolution of economic policy during the 1950 s and to his role in fiscal policy formation. Iwan Morgan 2 ̆ 7 s Eisenhon,er Versus ‘The Spenders’ goes far in filling this void and provides an insightful, interesting discussion of fiscal policy formation during the Eisenhower years. For many economic historians, the 1950 s {{seems to have been a}} nonevent sandwiched between the New Deal-Fair Deal and the New Frontier-a period of general prosperity punctuated by a few <b>inventory</b> <b>recessions,</b> or in current vernacular, slowdowns. Neither depression, war, nor rapid inflation occupied center stage. For Morgan, however, the 1950 s represents a compelling decade when the contours of the debate over the proper scope of fiscal policy in the postwar years emerged. Shaping this debate were external factors such as the return of the presidency to Republican leadership, the advent of the cold war, and the continued development of the corporate welfare state. Internally, the debate over fiscal policy took shape in a highly partisan environment when such irascible characters as Arthur Burns, George Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon all, in varying degrees, influenced policy...|$|R
40|$|We study whether {{differences}} in {{access to credit}} cause focused firms to perform differently from diversified firms in the product market. Prior work has identified binding credit constraints for bank-dependent firms during recessions. We assess whether corporate diversification alleviates these constraints. We find that during recessions sales growth rates drop more for bank-dependent focused firms than for rival segments of bank-dependent diversified firms. We also find that during <b>recessions</b> <b>inventory</b> growth rates drop more for bank-dependent focused firms than for bank-dependent diversified firms even after we control for contemporaneous sales growth. Consistent with a credit constraint explanation, we find {{no difference in the}} sensitivities to recessions of bank-independent focused and bank-independent diversified firms.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} of top executives is to maintain proper inventory levels. Excessive inventories {{at the time of}} a drop in business activity are likely to-lead to severe losses [...] occasionally bankruptcy [...] when management has to liquidate them on a falling market. On the other hand, insufficient <b>inventories</b> after a <b>recession</b> and at the start of an upsurge in business usually lead to delays in fulfilling orders and to losses in sales. In addition, the management of inventories affects company efforts to maintain more stable production and steadier jobs for employees. Of course, these are all things which most executives know. Keeping inventories at optimum profitable levels is, however, a perplexing problem. The questions businessmen raise in connection with management and control of inventories are basically aimed at action, not at arriving at answers. However, action questions are not enough by themselves. In order to get at the answers to the questions as a basis for taking action, it is necessary to back off and ask some rather different kinds of questions: "Why do we have inventories?" "What affects the inventory balances we maintain?" From these questions, a picture of the inventory problem can be built up which shows the influence on inventories and costs of the various alternative decisions which the management may ultimately want to consider. This type of analytic or functional question has been answered intuitively with considerable success in the past. As business has grown and as business executives have become more and more specialized in their jobs or farther removed from direct operations, however, the task of achieving an ecomical balance intuitively has become increasingly difficult. One of the principal difficulties in the intuitive approach is that the types and definitions of cost which influence appropriate inventory policy are not those characteristically found on the books of a company. Many costs such as setup or purchasing costs are hidden in the accounting records. Others such as inventory capital costs may never appear at all. Each cost may be clear to the operating head primarily responsible for its control; since it is a "hidden" cost, however, its importance may not be clear to other operating executives concerned. The resulting confusion may make it difficult to arrive at anything like a consistent policy. This is the reason why we have to take an analytic approach. In this paper major attention will be devoted to the conceptual framework of the analytic approach, including the definition on inventory function and the measurement of operational costs...|$|R
