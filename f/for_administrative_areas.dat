CORINE Land Cover data is used to spatialise agricultural nitrogen estimates calculated <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> of river basins. Results reported at the river basin level show a EU mean surplus of 60 kg N/ha. The distribution of the balances shows high surplus amounts in regions of intensive livestock farming (Flanders (B), the Netherlands, Brittany (FR) and low or deficit values in the central areas of Spain, France and Italy, The effect of using the CORINE Land Cover to spatialise agricultural nitrogen balance estimates was also examined through scenario analysis. These simulations indicated a slight improvement in estimation when the CORINE Land Cover was used to spatialise N estimates from an administrative unit level to a finer one (e:g: NUTS 2 to NUTS 3). A sensitivity of the coefficients of N content for harvested crops, manure and fertiliser showed a higher sensitivity of the model to crop related coefficients than manure coefficients.

40|$|Background: The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to objectively measure ‘obesogenic’ food {{environment}} (foodscape) exposure has become common-place. This increase in usage has {{coincided with the}} development of a methodologically heterogeneous evidence-base, with subsequent perceived difficulties for inter-study comparability. However, when used together in previous work, different types of {{food environment}} metric have often demonstrated some degree of covariance. Differences and similarities between density and proximity metrics, and within methodologically different conceptions of density and proximity metrics need to be better understood. Methods: Frequently used measures of food access were calculated for North East England, UK. Using food outlet data from local councils, densities of food outlets per 1000 population and per km 2 were calculated <b>for</b> small <b>administrative</b> <b>areas.</b> Densities (counts) were also calculated based on population-weighted centroids of <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> buffered at 400 / 800 / 1000 m street network and Euclidean distances. Proximity (street network and Euclidean distances) from these centroids to the nearest food outlet were also calculated. Metrics were compared using Spearman’s rank correlations. Results: Measures of foodscape density and proximity were highly correlated. Densities per km 2 and per 1000 population were highly correlated (rs[*]=[*] 0. 831). Euclidean and street network based measures of proximity (rs[*]=[*] 0. 865) and density (rs[*]=[*] 0. 667 - 0. 764, depending on neighbourhood size) were also highly correlated. Density metrics based on <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> and buffered centroids of <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> were less strongly correlated (rs[*]=[*] 0. 299 - 0. 658). Conclusions: Density and proximity metrics were largely comparable, with some exceptions. Whilst results suggested a substantial degree of comparability across existing studies, future comparability could be ensured by moving towards a more standardised set of environmental metrics, where appropriate, lessening the potential pitfalls of methodological variation between studies. The researchers’ role in creating their own obesogenic ‘reality’ should be better understood and acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure the balance of water demand versus water resource availability in an interfluve of West Bengal, India to support water resource planning, particularly of inter-basin transfers. Surface water availability was modelled using the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model, whilst groundwater availability was modelled based on water level fluctuations and the rainfall infiltration method. Water use was modelled separately for the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors using a predominantly normative approach and water use to availability ratios calculated <b>for</b> different <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> within the interfluve. Overall, the approach suggested that the interfluve receives 327 × 106 m 3 year? 1 of excess water after satisfying these sectoral demands, but that the eastern part of the study area is in deficit. However, a sensitivity analysis carried on the approach to several assumptions in the model suggested changed circumstances would produce surplus/deficit ranging from - 215 × 106 m 3 year? 1 to 435 × 106 m 3 year? 1.

40|$|Analysing spatial {{variations}} in regional economic performance {{is a common}} focus for research by regional scientists. Typically such investigations suffer from using de jure regions (such as Local Government Aras) as the spatial base as data tend to be readily available <b>for</b> such <b>administrative</b> <b>areas</b> to derive the variables that researchers use in econometric modelling.

This paper outlines how, in Australia, we have undertaken research to derive functional economic regions (FERs) to provide an improved spatial data base that is functional and not de jure-based to address the autocorrelation issue.

40|$|Abstract Background 'Traffic light' (red-yellow-green) {{maps are}} {{potentially}} powerful tools for 'at a glance' problem detection, for optimising resource allocation/reallocation, setting priorities, and targeting interventions to areas most in need. The maps can be also used <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>area</b> comparisons and performance monitoring over time. Interactive Web {{versions of the}} maps can be generated with many handy features to further empower organisations and decision makers. Methodological issues to consider when creating 'traffic light' maps include hue thresholding, data timeliness and stability of administrative boundaries. Results We used 'traffic light' maps to study the distribution of dentists per 1, 000 population in all 304 English Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and 22 Welsh Local Health Boards (LHBs) using datasets of dentist numbers per PCT (as at 31 December 2002) and LHB (as at 26 February 2004) from the Dental Practice Board, and 2001 Census population figures for PCTs and LHBs from the Office for National Statistics. The overall NHS dentists per 1, 000 population figures for England (0. 374) and Wales (0. 359) are low compared to many other countries, with less than 0. 3 dentist per 1, 000 people available to 24. 1 % {{of the total population}} of England (81 PCTs or 26. 6 % of all PCTs) and 26. 1 % of the total population of Wales (6 LHBs or 27. 3 % of all LHBs). A general shortage of NHS dentists can be observed at a glance across England and Wales on all the 'traffic light' maps in our study, even on those using a more "tolerant" classification and an additional orange-yellow class. The distribution of NHS dentists in England and Wales was also found to be not uniform, with some PCTs/LHBs, especially those located in some of the deprived or less populated urban and rural communities, suffering significantly more shortage of dentists than others (see [URL]). These results confirm recent media reports of a shortage of NHS dentists in various parts of England and Wales. Conclusion Suitable programmes are urgently needed to increase the numbers of NHS dentists across England and Wales.
