It can be fired from {{enclosures}} since {{it does not have}} a significant backblast; the rear of the tube, filled with plastic <b>granulate,</b> minimises the blast effect by the so-called recoilless countermass principle. The booster propellant for the projectile in its tube is ignited by a bolt via a spring mechanism. Once ejected from the launcher, the projectile coasts a safe distance and then the rocket motor is ignited, boosting it to its maximum speed, after which it coasts until impact. The gunner carries at least two rounds while the assistant grenadier carries an additional three rounds.|$|E
25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to <b>granulate</b> urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E

40|$|From {{empirical}} {{observations in}} the industrial practice {{it is known that}} compaction behavior and quality of uniaxial pressed ceramic compacts may be significantly influenced by climatic conditions at storage and processing of <b>granulates.</b> At the same time, the kind of basic material, added binders and lubricants can {{play a major role in}} most cases. In the present study, an attempt was made to reach a better understanding of the interactions between climatic conditions and compaction behavior of silicon nitride <b>granulates</b> with different binder/lubricant systems by using instrumented compaction experiments. In addition to the continuous measurement of the pressure-density development and the strength of the compacts, parameters are measured which characterize the friction conditions, the total compaction energy and their single parts, the elastic redeformation in axial and radial directions. From the calculation of shear and compressive stresses, statements on acting failure mechanisms as well as predictions on the expected density distribution can be given. For the examined silicon nitride <b>granulates</b> a deleterious influence of moisture on the whole pressing process and the defect rate of the compacts after storage of <b>granulates</b> at a humidity of more than 50 % before compaction, was verified. For this material the changes in compaction behavior are not reversible after storage at lower humidities. The achieved results show that the compaction behavior and the quality of uniaxial pressed compacts are significantly influenced by climatic conditions at storage and processing of <b>granulates.</b> Furthermore, it was demonstrated that not every fact known about the role of moisture during compaction of <b>granulates</b> from silicate ceramics can be applied to the group of advanced ceramics. For the examined silicon nitride <b>granulates</b> with the described binder/lubricant combinations, after their storage at a humidity of more than 50 %, a deleterious influence of moistures was verified. The experiments have shown that the absorption and desorption are indeed reversible processes for that case, but not the compaction behavior. The influence of cyclic changing climatic conditions must be avoided under all circumstances. Generally speaking, a greater effort is needed for the most important base materials of advanced ceramics to get a better understanding of the complicated correlations and interactions between the binder and lubricant properties of different types under varying humidity, temperatures and pressures. The determination of a system of specific pressing parameters with an instrumented compacting tool is a suitable way to achieve such progresses and to overcome the widespread empiricism...|$|R
