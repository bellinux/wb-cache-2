5|$|Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus. Because of this decision the name Brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered Apatosaurus, and the museum's popularity meant that Brontosaurus {{became one of the}} best known dinosaurs, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, {{the church at}} Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, {{with the construction of}} a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with a carved image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft may still be seen to {{the north side of the}} chancel.|$|E

5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E

And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India.

The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> contrary to Islamic injunctions.

While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them.

This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
