40|$|Synthetic {{graphite}} is {{an important}} industrial material, used in nuclear reactors, electrodes and many other applications. <b>Graphitisation</b> of coke is the solid-state transformation of the disordered carbon atoms into a well-ordered hexagonal graphite structure, requiring temperatures as high as 2 600 ºC. Catalytic <b>graphitisation</b> using metals or metal compounds allows the rearrangement of atoms to occur at lower temperatures. The extent of catalytic <b>graphitisation</b> is markedly dependent on the structural ordering of the parent coke, the catalyst concentration and the reaction conditions. Solvent extraction of coal using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent yields a refined coal solution referred to as Refcoal solution. Cokes of solvent-refined Tshikondeni coal derivatives {{have been found to}} be graphitisable. The activity of acetylacetonate and hydroxyquinolinate complexes of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe and Zr for catalysing the <b>graphitisation</b> of Refcoal cokes at 1 600 and 2 000 ºC was investigated. The effect of residence time on the catalytic <b>graphitisation</b> of Refcoal cokes was investigated by heat-treating cokes for two and six hours at 1 600 °C. For iron(III) acetylacetonate, the effect of metal concentrations was studied. Samples were analysed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and optical microscope techniques. The results show that calcium(II) acetylacetonate catalyses the <b>graphitisation</b> of Refcoal cokes. The degree of <b>graphitisation</b> increases with an increase in the iron concentration.

The arc was a low current (< 16 A) atmospheric electric discharge between a carbon rod cathode, and a moving carbon felt anode. The carbon arc was a low current(< 16 A) electric discharge between a cathode constructed of a carbon rod, and a moving carbon felt anode. The thermal profile within the anode material was predicted by a system of differential algebraic equations, adapted from the model developed by (Stark and Fricke, 1993). This set of equations was run using the software MATLAB R 2011 b, using a numerical integrator with consideration taken for sparsity. The change in degree of <b>graphitisation</b> was then predicted using the thermal profiles developed. This indicated that while the <b>graphitisation</b> of {{the surface of the}} felt exposed to the arc increased (from about 10 % to about 99 %) this effect did not penetrate far into the felt. At a depth of 0. 3 mm there was very little increase in <b>graphitisation</b> (about 7 % increase at slow movement rates, negligible at standard rates), indicating that this gaphitisation degree was unlikely to explain the improvement of battery cells produced using this material compared to non–arc treated material.

The effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and microstrength of metallurgical cokes was characterized using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and ultra-microindentation. In {{the process of}} heat treatment, the microstructure of the metallurgical cokes transformed toward the graphite structure.

The microstrength of cokes was significantly degraded in the process of heat treatment. The microstrength of the RMDC was lower, and of its deterioration caused by heat treatment was more severe than IMDC.

An increase in the catalyst content of the coke shows a substantial detrimental affect on the overall anisotropy of the carbon microstructure. The catalyst (with a particle size distribution between 0. 5 µm and 78 µm) was found to present a physical barrier around which the anisotropic flow domains formed. At higher catalyst concentrations the catalyst dominates the carbon microstructure; however, there is still evidence of flow patterns albeit with a shorter range.

40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} properties of coke samples excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at MEFOS in Lulea, Sweden were characterized. A thermal annealing study the raw coke {{used in the}} EBF was also conducted in a horizontal furnace in a neutral environment at a range of temperatures up to 1650 DGC. Carbon crystallite height of the EBF coke and of the cokes treated in the laboratory furnace were measured by XRD while mineral phases were characterized by using SEM/EDS. The CO 2 reactivity of the EBF cokes was measured by thermo-gravimetric analyser (TGA). The study demonstrated the strong effect of temperature on the modification of coke properties with special focus on carbon structure both under laboratory and experimental blast furnace conditions. The coke reactivity in the EBF was accelerated due to presence of recirculating alkalis in the coke, which increased as the coke descended in the EBF. The growth of carbon crystallite height of coke in the horizontal furnace {{was found to be}} of similar order as observed in the EBF under a similar range of temperatures. Comparison of carbon structure of laboratory treated cokes and the EBF excavated cokes indicated that carbon ordering of cokes is predominantly enhanced by the temperature rather than reacting gases or recirculating alkalis. The deterioration of coke quality such as coke strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity were related to coke <b>graphitisation,</b> alkalization and reactivity such that coke <b>graphitisation</b> was shown to have a strong impact on coke degradation behaviour. The study further implied that alkalis have a potential to influence the coke reactivity without affecting their <b>graphitisation</b> behaviour. The study also highlights the limitations of the CSR test for assessing the coke behaviour in an operating blast furnaces as it cannot simulate impact of <b>graphitisation</b> of cokes which is significant only at much higher temperatures.

Key to the efficient <b>graphitisation</b> of ultra-small samples {{is the type of}} iron catalyst and the effective trapping of water vapour in a ‘cold finger’ during the reaction. We have developed a simple liquid nitrogen cooling system that enables us to rapidly adjust the cold finger temperature in our laser-heated ‘microfurnace’, optimised for the <b>graphitisation</b> of microgram-sized carbon samples. This system is used to firstly transfer the CO 2 into the microfurnace, to maintain the cold finger at - 80 °C for ~ 5 minutes while the CO 2 is converted to CO and then at - 160 °C for ~ 25 minutes {{for the remainder of the}} reaction as the CO is converted to graphite. It comprises a machined aluminium cylinder mounted in the insulated cap of a 600 ml Dewar. The lower end is submerged in liquid nitrogen (LN 2). The upper end has a smaller diameter which is wound with an electric heating element and is provided with a thermocouple and a central hole into which the cold finger is inserted. Electrical power to the heater is adjusted by PID control, permitting the cold finger temperature to be adjusted over the range - 50 °C to - 160 °C at rates of up to 40 °C/min.

40|$|Experiments {{and theory}} are {{employed}} {{to investigate the}} laser ablation of boron doped diamond and tetrahedral amorphous carbon using nanosecond pulses. For a single pulse at low values of fluence, the laser induces a swelling of the surface due to <b>graphitisation,</b> whilst {{a high level of}} fluence leads to recession of the surface due to vaporization. To understand and investigate the underlying phenomena during the diamond-laser interaction, a model has been developed to reliably and quickly predict the behaviour of the surface and the thickness of the heat affected zone. The model is based on conservation of heat and mass during the laser-workpiece interaction. It consists of a one-dimensional system of non-linear equations that models the material heating, evaporation, <b>graphitisation</b> and plasma shielding. There is excellent agreement between numerical and experimental results for the position of the interfaces up to a high laser fluence. This model is the first to investigate the ablation of diamond that is able to capture surface swelling due to the <b>graphitisation</b> of the diamond layer, the graphite thickness and the amount of ablated material within a single framework.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of cast iron}} used for trunk mains in the water industry have been studied. Specimens have been sourced from nine different pipes, which had been in service for up to 150 years before failure. The bulk microstructures of each cast iron have been analysed {{with regard to the}} graphite flake morphology and size. The stress strain behaviours in tension and compression have been derived from specimens loaded in flexure. Flexural strength data have been obtained for 30 specimens from each pipe (three batches of 10 from different locations along the length and around the circumference of the pipe) and these data have been analysed using Weibull methods. The depth of <b>graphitisation</b> visible on the fracture surface of each sample has been measured. It is shown that the strength of the cast iron samples decreases with increasing depth of <b>graphitisation.</b> When the layer of graphitised material is of reasonably uniform thickness, the strength reduction is modest, but where the section loss is more local, the strength reduction is more significant for some samples there is a reduction in strength of more than 50 % when the depth of <b>graphitisation</b> exceeds 4 mm. Simple strength-of-materials and fracture mechanics approaches are shown to provide reasonable bounds for the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Graphite {{is widely}} used in modern industry, {{particularly}} in nuclear power generation in the UK. Understanding its formation is important for economical and safety reasons. The process to turn carbon materials into graphite by heat treatment is called the <b>graphitisation</b> process. It is the transformation of amorphous carbon, through a 2 D turbostratic carbon intermediate, into 3 D ordered layers of graphite. While many manufacturing processes have been established and many authors have contributed to understanding the important stages of <b>graphitisation,</b> the chemistry involved is not fully understood. It appears that impurities found in precursors can have {{a direct impact on}} the final graphite obtained. The following work is an investigation of the role played by these heteroatoms during the <b>graphitisation</b> process. Using density functional theory (DFT), calculations on possible mechanisms involved in the <b>graphitisation</b> process are investigated. However, the initial stages contain complex and poorly defined chemistry, so we have chosen to avoid this area, even though factors such as the C:H:O ratios are clearly important. Instead, this work is focussed on the latter stages of <b>graphitisation</b> in order to better understand the ordering processes to obtain graphite (and their inverse disordering, insofar as it is relevant to radiation damage). In this way it is still possible to invoke standard concepts in the physics and chemistry of defects in crystals. If there is too much disorder, and the system is close to amorphous in nature, complexity would overwhelm the project. The descriptions of an amorphous material with a little extra order would be much more difficult than the descriptions of a crystal with some disorder. For this reason, we have focussed on the heteroatoms which endure until the later stages of <b>graphitisation,</b> boron and sulphur, and also on turbostratic graphite, where calculations of interlayer separation as a function of relative rotation of a layer and of its neighbours are described. We find for sulphur that it can open up folds in graphite, forming very stable sulphur decorated edges. In dislocation terms, this could be the beginning of the dissociation of a perfect prismatic edge dislocation. An edge dislocation is described as an added half plane. If the plane is a bilayer graphene terminating in a fold, the dislocation is perfect. If the plane is a single graphene the dislocation is ‘partial’. Importantly two partial dislocations have lower elastic energy than the perfect, so dissociation is important in stabilising the structure. For boron, we show how it can pin twist boundaries, preventing slip and suggest that radiation damage can achieve the same effect through vacancies. The mechanism does not appear to involve cross-linking bonds and provides a good explanation for the variations in C 44 between different graphites and different methods of measurement. Furthermore, we show that B can aid in the removal of twist boundaries by pushing up their formation energy with respect to AB graphite...|$|E

Additionally, the degree of <b>graphitisation</b> of the carbon support has a detrimental effect on the activity of the cobalt (0) active sites, likely due to their potential as an electron donator. Consequently, the addition of electron donating promoters such as cesium substantially decreases the activity of the cobalt catalysts.

40|$|A high CSR coke {{was tested}} in the LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at Luleå. The {{evolution}} of {{physical and chemical properties}} of the centre-line coke samples were analysed by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), BET N 2 absorption and SEM/XRF/XRD. Alkali distribution in the EBF cokes was examined by XRF/SEM and EDS. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to measure isothermal and non-isothermal CO 2 reactivity of the cokes. The crystalline order of carbon and the concentration of alkalis were found to increase as the coke descended through thermal reserve zone to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The crystallite height (Lc) of EBF coke carbon displayed a linear correlation with the measured EBF temperatures demonstrating the strong effect of temperature on carbon structure of coke in the EBF. Alkali concentration of the coke was increased as it descended into the EBF, and was uniformly distributed throughout the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of lower zone cokes was found to increase when compared to the reactivity of the upper zones cokes, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkalis concentration. The deterioration of coke quality particularly coke strength and abrasion propensity were related to coke <b>graphitisation,</b> alkalization and reactivity. Coke <b>graphitisation</b> is shown to have a strong influence on the coke degradation behaviour in the EBF. Validerad; 2005; 20061210 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} {{conditions under which}} chemical reactions between diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings and oil additives occur and the main driving forces, i. e., the activation criteria for these chemical reactions, {{have not yet been}} defined. In order to clarify the difference between the test temperature and real contact temperature, and to determine the effect of the real contact temperature for these reactions, we have calculated the contact temperatures using two well-known models and compare them with results of tribological experiments and some state-of-the-art analyses of wornsurfaces. The results suggest that the actual surface temperatures are 100 - 130 °C higher than the test temperatures. A contact temperature of about 250 - 260 °C was found to be the required key activation criterion for chemical reactions between the dialkyl dithiophosphate extreme-pressure (EP) additive and the DLC coating. Gradual formation of a tribochemical protective film from phosphates and organic sulphur/sulphates suggests a lower chemical reactivity and slower formation of the optimal tribochemical protective layer on DLC coatings than on steels. No tribological effect of anti-wear (AW) or EP additives could be found on the DLC coatings when the surface temperatures were below 120 - 140 °C. The temperature-induced <b>graphitisation</b> of the DLC that occurred in the contacts with the base oils, however, require about 250 °C of contact temperature. Lower surface temperatures or the use of additives suppressed this <b>graphitisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fusion power off�ers a {{promising}} source of clean {{energy for the}} future, however, {{one of the greatest}} challenges in tokamak reactor design is developing materials suitable to withstand the intense plasma-material interactions. Carbon, mostly in its graphitic form, is currently a favorite plasma facing material in many reactors. Diamond, however, o�ffers many advantages over other materials but is not widely accepted. Although diamond exhibits excellent structural and thermal properties, tritium retention is a major concern for carbon. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that diamond might fare better than other carbon structures as a plasma facing material. This thesis investigates the the cumulative eff�ect of exposing diamond to high thermal shock and tritium bombardment using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Of interest is diamond's resistance to <b>graphitisation</b> and the mechanisms behind tritium retention. Surfaces of di�fferent lattice orientation and level of hydrogen termination were incrementally heated to temperatures in excess of 2000 K. Generally, these diamond structures appeared to be stable up to temperatures of about 1000 K. Orientation did play a large part in determining the temperature of phase change, as did the level of hydrogen termination. Greater hydrogen coverages mimicked bulk continuation and increased resistance to <b>graphitisation.</b> These diamond surfaces, as well as a graphite and a diamond grain-boundary surface, were bombarded at a range of temperatures (300 - 2100 K) with high fluxes (1029 m- 2 s- 1) of 15 eV tritium atoms in studying relative tritium retention at and below the surface as well as sputtered hydrocarbon yields. Below temperatures of <b>graphitisation</b> the diamond structure con�fined tritium, and thus further structural damage, to the upper surface. The graphitic surface allowed for deeper tritium penetration and retention. The presence of a grain boundary in the diamond slab allowed small amounts of tritium to penetrate deep into the bulk. Diamond surfaces were also bombarded at 300 K whilst independently varying incident ion energy (7. 5 - 30 eV) and incident interval time (0. 3 - 1. 2 ps). Greater ion energies caused proportionally greater damage as well as reducing the ability of the structure to disperse incident thermal energy. At these extremely high fluxes sputter yield appeared to not vary with flux but was found to be proportional to fluence...|$|E
40|$|The energy demands by the {{industrial}} world are continuing to rise, while the rate of new oil discoveries is falling. Within the next 30 years, available petroleum supplies are likely to fail to meet the demand, and oil {{will no longer be}} able to serve as the world’s major energy source. Coal, being relatively abundant worldwide and potentially adaptable for use in existing plants that have been engineered for petroleum use, can serve as an inexpensive substitute for, or successor to, the more expensive oil fuels in use today. Graphitisable carbon is one of the high-value products from petroleum as its value lies partly in the nuclear industry. Making graphitisable isotropic carbon from well-purified coal is therefore a primary motivation for this study. However, its purity is far too low. Substantial purification is obtained by dissolving the organic part of coal in dimethylformamide with the addition of a little alkali. Results indicated that more than 90 % of the organic part of a 10 % ash flotation product dissolved in N, N dimethylformamide on addition of 10 % NaOH. The bulk of the impurities are removed by centrifugation and the dissolved organic material is recovered by water precipitation. Subsequently, the ash level is lowered from 10 % in the coal to high S- 2 coal extracts derived at high temperature (GSF- 25 HT) and no S- 2 coal extracts derived at room temperature (GSF- 0 RT) > no S- 2 coal extracts derived at high temperature (GSF- 0 HT), corresponding to 79 > 75 % and 67 > 25 % respectively. The interlayer spacing (d 002 -value) of the graphites follows the order GSF- 25 RT (3. 37 Å) 61 > 62 %, corresponding to 0. 44 > 0. 88 > 1. 60 acetylene black. With the addition of carbon black, the decreasing order of <b>graphitisation</b> was 57. 7 > 56. 5 > 51. 5 %, corresponding to 0. 44 > 0. 88 > 1. 60 wt % respectively. The interlayer spacing d 002, increased in the same order, suggesting a shift towards a turbostratic and formation of a poorly graphitised, and turbostratic carbon. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the intensity ratio R of the g to the d peak decreased with increasing dosage of the carbon additive. Cokes produced from the coal extracts prepared at 25 oC but without S- 2 showed also a remarkable degree of flow texture. Its crystalline domain units were relatively small. The resin-mounted coke samples observed under an optical microscope (objective x 25) showed reduced flow texture with the addition of carbon black. The graphitisability of the resultant cokes also decreased on addition of carbon black. The optimum dosage observed for reducing the flow texture without reducing the crystallinity was found to be < 0. 22 %. Improved degree of <b>graphitisation</b> of the carbon was studied on addition of iron (lll) compounds. Iron (lll) compounds showed a promising improvement in the graphitisability of the carbon when added in small amounts. The intracellular hard carbon is converted to soft carbon, thereby improving the degree of <b>graphitisation.</b> The overall effect was a more isotropic graphitic carbon but the degree of <b>graphitisation</b> obtained was far too low: on addition of 1 % and 3 % (by wt) of iron (lll), the compounds were 21 % and 27 % respectively. Oxygen intrusion into the precursor’s coal material prior to heat treatment is thought to have inhibited the degree of <b>graphitisation.</b> Increasing the amounts of the iron (lll) compound and prohibiting the intrusion of oxygen during mixing could improve the graphitisability of carbon. However, the optimum amount to be used remains an important subject to be explored in future. Thesis (PhD (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|E
