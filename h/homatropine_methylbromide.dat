5000|$|Homatropine (Equipin, Isopto Homatropine) is an {{anticholinergic}} {{medication that}} is an antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and thus the parasympathetic nervous system. It is used in eye drops as a cycloplegic (to temporarily paralyze accommodation), and as a mydriatic (to dilate the pupil).For <b>Homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> see Methylhomatropine, {{this is a different}} medication.Homatropine is less potent than atropine and has a shorter duration of action. It is available as the hydrobromide salt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> or Methylhomatropine bromide is a {{quaternary}} ammonium salt of methylhomatropine. It is a peripherally acting anticholinergic medication that inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptors {{and thus the}} parasympathetic nervous system. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It is used to effectively relieve intestinal spasms and abdominal cramps, without producing the adverse effects of less specific anticholinergics.It is used, in addition to papaverine, {{as a component of}} mild drugs that help [...] "flush" [...] the bile.|$|E

40|$|A flow {{injection}} turbidimetric procedure exploiting merging zones {{is proposed}} for determining <b>homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> (HMB) in pharmaceutical preparations. The determination {{is based on}} the precipitation reaction of <b>homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> with AgNO 3 solution to form a precipitate, which was measured at 410 nm. The analytical curve was linear in the HMB concentration range from 8. 0 x 10 - 4 to 1. 7 x 10 - 3 mol L- 1, with a detection limit of 9. 5 x 10 - 5 mol L- 1. The recoveries ranged from 94. 9 to 104 %, the sampling frequency was 75 h- 1 and relative standard deviations were smaller than 2. 0 % for solutions containing 1. 2 x 10 - 3 and 1. 5 x 10 - 3 mol L- 1 HMB (n= 10). The results obtained for commercial formulations using the FIA procedure were in good agreement with those obtained by using a comparative method (r= 0. 9983) ...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} is a neoplasm of melanocytic origin. Rarely melanomas {{may present}} itself without clinically evident pigmentation termed as amelanotic melanoma. Though Oral malignant melanomas represent only 0. 2 to 8 % of melanomas occurring in body, {{they have been}} extensively reviewed but with rare mention of non-pigmented melanomas (Amelanotic oral malignant melanoma) in literature. Amelanotic oral melanomas are difficult to diagnose clinically and histopathologically leading to delay in treatment with poor prognosis. We report a case of Amelanotic oral malignant melanoma in 55 year old Indian male with review of cases reported to contribute with data of such rare lesion. The final diagnosis was established on basis of histopathology and immunohistochemistry using vimentin, S- 100, <b>Homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> and melan-A...|$|E
40|$|An open-tubular {{capillary}} electrochromatography column was prepared by chemically immobilized β-cyclodextrin modified gold nanoparticles onto new surface with the prederivatization of (3 -mercaptopropyl) -trimethoxysilane. The synthesized nanoparticles and the prepared column {{were characterized by}} transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. When the column was employed as the chiral stationary phase, no enantioselectivity was observed for ten model basic drugs. So β-cyclodextrin {{was added to the}} background electrolyte as chiral additive to expect a possible synergistic effect occurring and resulting in a better separation. Fortunately, significant improvement in enantioselectivity was obtained for ten pairs of drug enantiomers. Then, the effects of β-cyclodextrin concentration and background electrolyte pH on the chiral separation were investigated. With the developed separation mode, all the enantiomers (except for venlafaxine) were baseline separated in resolutions of 4. 49, 1. 68, 1. 88, 1. 57, 2. 52, 2. 33, 3. 24, 1. 63 and 3. 90 for zopiclone, chlorphenamine maleate, brompheniramine maleate, dioxopromethazine hydrochloride, carvedilol, homatropine hydrobromide, <b>homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide,</b> venlafaxine, sibutramine hydrochloride and terbutaline sulfate, respectively. Further, the possible separation mechanism involved was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML), a rare benign mesenchymal tumour, is characterised by the {{presence}} of mature adipose tissue, smooth‐muscle cells and thick‐walled blood vessels. Increasing attention to hepatic AMLs has led to the discovery that sufficient proportions of fat often allow for definite diagnoses preoperatively. However, the proportion of fatty tissue in these tumours is highly variable. One case of hepatic AML is reported, where the amount of fat was < 1 %. In this case, the viral hepatitis markers, including hepatitis B antigen and anti‐hepatitis C virus antibody, were negative. The serum α‐fetoprotein level was 3. 4  ng/ml and in the normal range. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass measuring 5  cm in diameter and without an obvious capsule in the left lobe of the liver. A dynamic computed tomography scan showed a well‐defined and slightly enhanced mass in the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver. Angiography showed that the mass was hypervascular in character. As hepatocellular carcinoma was highly suspected from these preoperative image studies, a left lobectomy was carried out. Microscopically, the amount of fat was too low to establish a diagnosis of hepatic AML. However, positive <b>homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> 45 immunoreactivity of the smooth‐muscle cells seemed to assist in arriving at the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Reflex vagal {{hypertonia}} (RVH) {{has been}} identified as a possible cause of sudden unexpected death in infants {{during the first year of}} life. <b>Homatropine</b> <b>methylbromide</b> (HM) is an anticholinergic drug known to inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, thus affecting the parasympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of HM on 24 -h Holter electrocardiographic signs of RVH (pre-HM treatment vs post-HM treatment; post-HM treatment vs a control group of healthy infants). A total of 50 patients (mean age, 6. 1 +/- 2. 7 months; 28 males, 22 females; 12 born pre-term) affected by RVH were enrolled in the study. Pre-HM treatment vs post-HM treatment: statistically significant differences were detected for higher heart rate, lower heart rate, mean heart rate, longer sinusal pause, presence of advanced atrio-ventricular blocks, and systolic blood pressure (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 00001, p< 0. 02, p< 0. 00001, p< 0. 05, and p< 0. 04, respectively). A statistically significant correlation was revealed between HM-administered dose and both average heart rate and systolic blood pressure (r= 0. 93, p< 0. 0001; r= 0. 94, p< 0. 0001, respectively). No significant differences were detected between post-HM treatment electrocardiographic data and those of the control group. By antagonizing action of the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic system on the heart, thus increasing cardiac frequency, HM treatment appears to feature a good safety profile and be highly effective in preventing transient infantile hypervagotonia, the potential cause of several cases of sudden unexpected death during the first year of life...|$|E
