5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion <b>domes</b> rather than helmet <b>domes.</b> Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion <b>domes</b> existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion <b>domes</b> could not be imported from the Orient, where onion <b>domes</b> did not replace spherical <b>domes</b> until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava <b>domes.</b> Growing lava <b>domes</b> are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags <b>domes</b> between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous <b>domes.</b> The largest onion <b>domes</b> were erected in the seventeenth century in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped <b>domes,</b> whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped <b>domes</b> are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped <b>domes</b> are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E

5|$|Roman <b>domes</b> {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer <b>domes,</b> segmental <b>domes,</b> and ribbed <b>domes</b> were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. <b>Domes</b> were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of <b>domes</b> declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Russian icons painted {{before the}} Mongol {{invasion}} of Rus do not feature churches with onion <b>domes.</b> Two highly venerated pre-Mongol churches {{that have been}} rebuilt—the Assumption Cathedral and the Cathedral of Saint Demetrius in Vladimir—display golden helmet <b>domes.</b> Restoration work on several other ancient churches revealed some fragments of former helmet-like <b>domes</b> below newer onion cupolas.|$|E
5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion <b>domes.</b> First onion <b>domes</b> displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet <b>domes</b> discovered by restorators beneath modern onion <b>domes</b> as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion <b>domes,</b> prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet <b>domes.</b> He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion <b>domes</b> in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems logical that elongated, or onion, <b>domes</b> {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion <b>domes</b> were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} <b>domes</b> featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these <b>domes</b> are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion <b>domes</b> first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion <b>domes</b> were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|The History of Roman and Byzantine <b>domes</b> {{traces the}} {{architecture}} of <b>domes</b> throughout the ancient Roman Empire and its medieval continuation, today called the Byzantine Empire. <b>Domes</b> were important architectural elements in both periods and had widespread influence on contemporary and later styles, from Russian and Ottoman architecture to the Italian Renaissance and modern revivals. The <b>domes</b> were customarily hemispherical, although octagonal and segmented shapes are also known, and they developed in form, use, and structure over the centuries. Early examples rested directly on the rotunda walls of round rooms and featured a central oculus for ventilation and light. Pendentives became common in the Byzantine period, provided support for <b>domes</b> over square spaces.|$|E
5|$|The <b>domes</b> {{are often}} brightly painted: their colors may informally symbolise {{different}} aspects of religion. Green, blue, and gold <b>domes</b> are sometimes held to represent the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus, respectively.

5|$|Onion <b>domes</b> {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. <b>Domes</b> standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral <b>domes</b> with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E
5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs.

5|$|Prior to {{the eighteenth}} century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any {{particular}} symbolism to the exterior {{shape of a}} church. Nevertheless, onion <b>domes</b> are popularly believed to symbolise burning candles. In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that the onion shape of Russian church <b>domes</b> may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering <b>domes</b> were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude. Another explanation {{has it that the}} onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|The {{midrange}} <b>dome</b> is 8.8cm (3.5") {{in diameter}} and made from beryllium metal, a very low-density (1.8 g/cm3) but strong metal, fabricated by vapor depositing the metal onto a <b>dome</b> mold. The {{result is that the}} midrange <b>dome</b> is very responsive. The <b>dome</b> surround is made from a cloth that is coated with two types of resins and is folded to create creases that are tangent to the <b>dome.</b> This design holds the <b>dome</b> firmly, yet allows the <b>dome</b> to move accurately.|$|R
5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental <b>domes</b> in particular. Modest <b>domes</b> in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These <b>domes</b> are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. <b>Domes</b> were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of <b>domes</b> did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and <b>domes</b> {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete <b>domes.</b> But concrete <b>domes</b> also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick <b>domes</b> need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|The <b>domes</b> {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of <b>domes</b> helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the <b>domes</b> themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed <b>domes</b> could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin <b>domes</b> could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E
50|$|Arc <b>Dome</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with Toiyabe <b>Dome,</b> {{but these are}} separate peaks. Toiyabe <b>Dome</b> at 11361 ft is about 5 mi southeast of Arc <b>Dome,</b> above the small community of Carvers, Nevada.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Jurassic-Cenozoic {{structural}} {{evolution of}} the eastern North Sea Basin {{is influenced by the}} central North Sea <b>Dome,</b> the Danish Megablock, the Tornquist Zone and the South Swedish <b>Dome.</b> The central North Sea <b>Dome</b> isa composite <b>dome</b> comprising the Triple Junction <b>Dome,</b> the Central Graben <b>Dome</b> and the Friesland <b>Dome.</b> The Danish Megablock, newly recognized here, is a first-order tectonic element between the Central Graben and the Tornquist Zone. In Jurassic-Cretaceous time it was tilted towards the east during uplift of the Central Graben <b>Dome,</b> whereas the movement was reversed uring the Cenozoic post-rift subsidence. Contemporaneous with the westward tilting of the Danish Megablock, the South Swedish <b>Dome</b> was uplifted to the east. The uplift-subsidence reversal across the eastern North Sea Basin links the collapse of the Central Graben <b>Dome</b> and the tilt reversal of the Danish Megablock with the uplift of the South Swedish <b>Dome.</b> The uplift followed by subsidence probably involved mass flow in the asthenosphere to account for the observed balance between post-rift subsidence and marginal uplift. The model explains the uplift of both the South Swedish <b>Dome</b> and southern England as the result of Cenozoic post-rift subsidence of the Mesozoic Central Graben <b>Dome...</b>|$|R
