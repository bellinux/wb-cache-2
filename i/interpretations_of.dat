5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force {{in the creation of a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> his reign.|$|E
