40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} the DFT methods and basis sets on harmine {{molecule}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> 26 DFT methods with 6 basis sets were used. Two main comparison chosen DFT methods in this work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> It <b>is</b> concluded that this contribution is very important and cannot be neglected. In the following analysis, changes in energy levels <b>were</b> <b>investigated</b> by two different methods. Considering a specific basis set, changes in energy levels were obtained using different DFT methods. A specific DFT method is chosen and changes in energy levels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> by means of various basis sets.

25|$|More growers {{entered the}} industry. The {{labour-intensive}} raft method {{was replaced with}} a modified Japanese longline system. Biodegradable stockings were packed with spat and tied to parallel rows of looped ropes, supported by buoys. Young mussels grow through the stockings, anchoring themselves to the ropes with their strong byssal threads (beards). The farms are usually located in sheltered or semi-sheltered areas where there is sufficient depth of water at low tide to keep the longline droppers off the bottom. Recent research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigating</b> offshore mussel farming in exposed areas several kilometres from shore, such as farms offshore from Napier and Opotiki.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} view of Islam {{has also}} been criticised {{for the lack of}} supporting evidence consistent with that view, such as the lack of archaeological evidence, and discrepancies with non-Muslim literary sources. In the 1970s, what {{has been described as a}} [...] "wave of sceptical scholars" [...] challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies. They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources. The oldest of this group was John Wansbrough (1928–2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, but perhaps not widely read. In 1972 a cache of ancient Qur'ans in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen was discovered – commonly known as the Sana'a manuscripts. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>investigating</b> these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.|$|E

The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|E
