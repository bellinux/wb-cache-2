The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the {{performance}} of the basic Local Linear Wavelet Neural Network model (LLWNN) can be improved with hybridizing it with fuzzy model. The new improved LLWNN based Neurofuzzy hybrid model is used to predict two currency exchange rates i. e. <b>the</b> U. S. <b>Dollar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indian Rupee and <b>the</b> U. S. <b>Dollar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Yen. The forecasting of foreign exchange rates is done on different time horizons for 1 day, 1 week and 1 month ahead. The LLWNN and Neurofuzzy hybrid models are trained with the backpropagation training algorithm. The two performance measurers i. e. the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) show the superiority of the Neurofuzzy hybrid model over the LLWNN model...|$|R
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E

There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foundation.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator Frank Greene {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative coins {{to mark the}} 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the Battle of Bennington the same year. His bill passed the Senate without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E
