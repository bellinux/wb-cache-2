5|$|The {{scale of}} {{ecological}} dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating {{on a single}} tree, {{while at the same}} time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, landscape, and chronological scales.|$|E
5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. <b>Data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. <b>Data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Vera can be ascertained {{back to a}} diffuse area of low {{pressure}} first incorporated into surface weather analysis early on September20. At the time, the disturbance was situated between Guam and Chuuk State. Though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) did not classify the incipient system as a tropical cyclone, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) analyzed the disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000UTC that day. Initially, the depression tracked westward, but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on September21. Late that day, a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by the JTWC to analyze the disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure. However, the <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the storm's periphery was sufficient enough for the warning center to classify the depression as a tropical storm at 1800UTC that day. Despite the flight data, the JMA had already determined the system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier. As a result of the reclassification, the tropical storm was designated the name Vera by the JTWC. At this point the tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course.|$|E

Gut feelings go beyond first impressions: Physicians expressed feeling doubtful about their initial impressions as they gathered more data from their patients. More experienced physicians reported more instances of gut feelings than those less experienced, but {{the quality of the}} intuition was related to the quality of feedback received during the data collection process in general. Emotional engagement enhanced learning just as it does in first impressions.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} widely used {{taxonomies}} now used are the Tholen classification and SMASS classification. The former was proposed in 1984 by David J. Tholen, and was based on <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories. In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in {{a modified version of}} the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the M-type. There are also several smaller classes.|$|E

25|$|An archaeological {{investigation}} {{usually involves}} several distinct phases, {{each of which}} employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective {{as to what the}} archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon.

And, third, the <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that Dolichovespula queens including D. sylvestris queens mate only once or have most sperm fertilizing eggs {{come from a}} single mate. The characteristics in this species of the queens having one mate, only 1-2 queens producing eggs in a nest, and {{a high level of}} worker policing indicates individuals in the nest will be very closely related. One study estimated that the relatedness among workers was 0.68 with <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> 10 nests of twenty workers and the queen from each. This value was calculated by analysis at 3 DNA microsatellite loci which allowed the researchers to determine if males were queens’ or workers’ sons. Then using a computer program, relatedness among individuals in the nest was able to be estimated. This high level of relatedness between wasps in the nest is likely what explains the eusocial behavior in this species.|$|E
