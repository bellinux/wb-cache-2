40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our {{research}} directions {{on the issue}} of precise manipulation and modeling interactions for outdoor augmented reality. We also discuss the related issues of action at a distance techniques and the relationship between virtual and physical objects. Techniques for action at a distance are limited by the accuracy of the sensors, as well as the efficiency of tracking solution. We examine possible solutions for precise interactions including symbolic entry of data, <b>grid</b> <b>snapping,</b> and alignment operations. <b>Grid</b> <b>snapping</b> and relative snapping are also discussed as ways to improve precision...|$|R

Transformation parameters can be also specified numerically in the Transform dialog. Transformations can <b>snap</b> <b>to</b> angles, <b>grids,</b> guidelines and nodes of other objects. <b>Grids,</b> guides and <b>snapping</b> properties are defined on a per-document basis. As an alternative <b>to</b> <b>snapping,</b> an Align and Distribute dialog is provided, which can perform common alignment tasks on selected objects: e.g. line them up in a specified direction, space them equally, scatter them at random and remove overlaps between objects.|$|R

He moves his cursor to a point in 3D space where there are no geometric attributes <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>to.</b> Although there may be 3D surfaces underneath the cursor, Drafting Assistant intuits the designer's intent and offers an intersection point comprising the Y- and Z-axis coordinates of the first edge and the X-axis coordinate of the nearest edge. At this location, the designer adds a circle freehand and then specifies a diameter of 200 millimeters by typing it into the box at bottom right. Last, the designer uses the [...] "Remove profile from solid" [...] tool to cut through the block.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} several selection aids to improve pointing input on tabletop displays. Our previous research explored the TractorBeam–a hybrid point-touch interaction technique for tabletop displays. We found that while pointing input was preferred (over touch) by users of tabletop displays, it was slower for small distant targets. Drawing from previous work on improving target acquisition for desktop displays, we developed and tested three selection aids to improve pointing selection of small distant targets on tabletop displays: expanding the cursor, expanding the target, and <b>snapping</b> <b>to</b> the target. Our experiments revealed that all three aids resulted in faster selection times than no selection aid at all, with <b>snapping</b> <b>to</b> the target being the fastest. Additionally, participants liked <b>snapping</b> <b>to</b> the target {{better than the other}} selection aids and found it to be the most effective for selecting targets. ...|$|R
