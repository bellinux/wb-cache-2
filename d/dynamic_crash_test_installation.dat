The research herein was originated {{from the earlier}} work of Prof. Shirvani, patented and further investigated by Cellbond Composites Ltd. who has invested in further research, for developing an analytical tool for geometric optimisation as an enhanced resolution to various shapes and materials. Energy absorption in egg-box occurs through plastic deformation of cell walls, examined through non–linear finite element simulations using ANSYS® and ANSYS/LS–DYNA® FE packages. Experimental <b>dynamic</b> <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been designed to}} verify the validity of the FE simulations. Geometrical models are defined as 3 D graphical representations, outlined in detail. Further, the impact behaviour of commercially pure aluminium egg-box energy absorbers is studied to identify the optimum design parameters describing the geometry of the structure. A simulation-based multi-objective optimisation strategy is employed to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions where each solution represents a trade-off point with respect to the two conflicting objectives: the maximum impact force and the energy absorption capacity of the structure. The aim is to simultaneously minimise the former and maximise the latter, in the attempt to find purpose–specific optimal egg–box geometries. In light of the associated outcomes, it is shown that egg–box geometries with < ω), thin walls (t < 1 mm), short inter–peak distances and small peak diameters. M – < ω), thin walls (t < 1 mm), lengthy inter–peak distances and smaller peak diameters. It is concluded that, egg–box structures combined in the form of sandwich panels can be designed per application to act as optimised energy absorbers. Results of the proposed optimised sandwich structure are verified using analytical techniques...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} models of connections {{are essential for}} the design of aluminium parts in cars. Today, there exist a few models customized for self-piercing rivets (SPR), but none for self-piercing screws (SPS). This thesis presents an experimental and numerical study on the behaviour of SPR and SPS connections for different loading situations. For the rolled base material, AA 6016 in the T 4 condition, uniaxial tension, plane strain tension and in-plane single shear tests were performed. The Voce isotropic hardening rule and the YLD- 2004 - 18 P anisotropic yield function were calibrated using MatPrePost. The calibration was validated by simulations of the material tests. Cross tests in three directions, single lap-joint tests and peeling tests were performed for SPR and SPS, and a point-connector model developed for self-piercing rivets was calibrated by a reverse engineering approach based on the cross tests. Single lap-joint and peeling tests were used for validation. Forming process simulations were performed to account for initial plastic deformations in bent specimens. In all tests except for pure normal loading, failure of SPR was initiated from the top sheet, while failure of SPS was caused by pull-out from the bottom sheet in all cases. For SPR, good predictions were found, except for over-prediction of the peeling resistance. The model was not able to describe mixed tension and shear loading accurately for SPS, but other tests were well reproduced. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>crash</b> box <b>tests</b> were performed and deformation and failure modes of SPR and SPS were characterized. The same progressive buckling mode was found in all tests. Higher force was observed for riveted crash boxes compared to the screwed. Relative movement between the sheets was observed for SPS. During dynamic testing, 7 % of the SPR and 19 % of the SPS connections failed. Simulations of <b>dynamic</b> <b>crash</b> box <b>tests</b> investigated effects of forming history, yield surface and mesh size. The deformation mode was well reproduced, but the force was under-predicted with 5 % to 20 %. The simulations predicted some connection failure for SPS, but not for SPR. A more fundamental understanding of the behaviour of SPS connections is required to develop a new point-connector model. Further studies could include investigation of the effects of screw diameter, sheet thickness, sheet material, screw material and dynamic effects of the connection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{thin-walled}} {{components in}} CFRP composite materials are considered {{in order to}} progressively replace metals for crashworthy applications in the automotive industry, thanks to their undoubted advantages such as high strength to weight ratio. The present chapter {{is dealing with the}} lightweight design and the crashworthiness analysis of a composite nose cone as the Formula SAE racing car front impact attenuator. The analysis of the crash behaviour was conducted both numerically, using explicit FE codes as LS-DYNA and Radioss, and experimentally, by means of a drop weight test machine. In order to assess the quality of the simulation results, initially a complete comparative analysis with material characterization was developed on simple CFRP composite tubes subjected to dynamic axial impact loading. After quasi-static and <b>dynamic</b> experimental <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> on the composite nose cone were performed. These experimental results are reported together with numerical simulation ones. The main idea of the research was to demonstrate energy absorbing capabilities of a thin-walled crash box during the frontal impact, with the lowest initial deceleration. In order to initialize the collapse in a stable way, the design of the composite impact attenuator has been completed with a trigger which consists of a very simple smoothing (progressive reduction) of the wall thickness.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn <b>dynamic</b> {{aircraft}} <b>crash</b> <b>testing,</b> {{the head}} trajectory of an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) is typically recorded by photometric analysis from the high-speed video. While photometric analysis can provide useful data results, {{it does have}} a number of short comings including the need to correct for lens distortion, perspective, parallax, and scale factor. Additionally, photometric analysis can be operator dependent which can result in variability of the output head trajectory. This dissertation describes a method of evaluating the ATD head trajectory from accelerometer and angular rate sensor data by use of an algorithm utilizing Euler parameters and spatial kinematics. Local angular velocity data is utilized in conjunction with Euler parameters and numerically integrated, solved with the Runge-Kutta 4 th order method, to generate a transformation matrix at each time step. The local acceleration data is then converted to global acceleration using the transformation matrix data, accounting for gravitation influence and global coordinate system movement through the event. The methodology developed to calculate the ATD head trajectory and leg flail from the local instrumentation data is validated through experimental testing. These tests are conducted at the component level and then, incrementing complexity, with a head component tester and finally with a complete ATD in multiple test cases. The output displacement data is compared to a known trajectory path and 2 D and 3 D photometric analysis data. Overall, this dissertation combines the use of classical mechanics and experimental test procedures in a unique, viable, and efficient method to evaluate ATD head and leg flail kinematics...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for Airbus preparing a new freighter development process was {{the design of a}} solid freighter barrier, which separates the courier area from the cargo compartment. The major task of such a barrier is to protect the passengers against all risks caused due to cargo impact by a justifiable design. These risks may result from all kind of survivable incident and accident scenarios. Real aircraft crashes were analyzed to get away from a static book-case and come to a more realistic <b>dynamic</b> <b>crash</b> scenario. A reduced-order simulation model was built up to investigate and simulate the <b>dynamic</b> effects during <b>crash.</b> The simulation model considers the highly nonlinear stiffness and damping characteristics of all critical cargo types and also includes their energy absorption potentials. A series of full scale container <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed at accredited car <b>crash</b> facilities.
