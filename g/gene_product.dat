5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a <b>gene</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.|$|E

Furthermore, when the expression of ST 2 <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> was silenced by RNA-interference technique, Ras (G 12 V) -induced cellular transformation was drastically suppressed.

40|$|The mature T cell {{repertoire}} {{is thought}} to be shaped by two events that occur during maturation of the immune system: negative selection, which functions to eliminate high affinity self-reactive immune-competent cells, and positive selection, which results in selection of T cells with affinity for foreign antigens in association with self MHC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> (1, 2). The identification of the molecules that play a critical role as ligands for the TCR in these events has been an important issue in the further characterization of these processes. <b>Gene</b> <b>products</b> encoded by the MHC have been widely accepted as relevant ligands for both positive and negative selection.

25|$|The {{molecular}} correlate of the filament formation was described. The {{exposure to}} β-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in Escherichia coli. During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both β-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in E.coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system {{leading to the}} inactivation of the ftsl <b>gene</b> <b>product,</b> penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene {{is a group of}} filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of β-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large volume}} of data and {{information}} about <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> has been stored in various molecular biology databases. A major challenge for knowledge discovery using these databases is to identify related <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> in disparate databases. The development of Gene Ontology (GO) as a common vocabulary for annotation allows integrated queries across multiple databases and identification of semantically related <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> (i. e., <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> that have similar GO annotations). Meanwhile, dozens of tools {{have been developed for}} browsing, mining or editing GO terms, their hierarchical relationships, or their "associated" <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> (i. e., <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> annotated with GO terms). Tools that allow users to directly search and inspect relations among all GO terms and their associated <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> from multiple databases are needed. Results We present a standalone package called DynGO, which provides several advanced functionalities in addition to the standard browsing capability of the official GO browsing tool (AmiGO). DynGO allows users to conduct batch retrieval of GO annotations for a list of <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products,</b> and semantic retrieval of <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> sharing similar GO annotations. The result are shown in an association tree organized according to GO hierarchies and supported with many dynamic display options such as sorting tree nodes or changing orientation of the tree. For GO curators and frequent GO users, DynGO provides fast and convenient access to GO annotation data. DynGO is generally applicable to any data set where the records are annotated with GO terms, as illustrated by two examples. Conclusion We have presented a standalone package DynGO that provides functionalities to search and browse GO and its association databases as well as several additional functions such as batch retrieval and semantic retrieval.

40|$|The umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products,</b> whose {{expression}} is induced by DNA-damaging treatments, have been extensively characterized for {{their role in}} SOS mutagenesis. We have recently presented evidence that supports a role for the umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> in the regulation of growth after DNA damage in exponentially growing cells, analogous to a prokaryotic DNA damage checkpoint. Our further characterization of the growth inhibition at 30 °C associated with constitutive expression of the umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> from a multicopy plasmid {{has shown that the}} umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> specifically inhibit the transition from stationary phase to exponential growth at the restrictive temperature of 30 °C and that this is correlated with a rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis. These observations led to the finding that physiologically relevant levels of the umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products,</b> expressed from a single, SOS-regulated chromosomal copy of the operon, modulate the transition to rapid growth in E. coli cells that have experienced DNA damage while in stationary phase. This activity of the umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> is correlated with an increase in survival after UV irradiation. In a distinction from SOS mutagenesis, uncleaved UmuD together with UmuC is responsible for this activity. The umuDC-dependent increase in resistance in UV-irradiated stationary-phase cells appears to involve, at least in part, counteracting a Fis-dependent activity and thereby regulating the transition to rapid growth in cells that have experienced DNA damage. Thus, the umuDC <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> appear to increase DNA damage tolerance at least partially by regulating growth after DNA damage in both exponentially growing and stationary-phase cells...|$|R
