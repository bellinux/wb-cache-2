50|$|Some {{circuit designs}} {{naturally}} output antimetric networks. For instance, a low-pass Butterworth filter implemented as a ladder network with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> elements will be antimetric. Similarly, a bandpass Butterworth with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> resonators will be antimetric, as will a Butterworth mechanical filter with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mechanical resonators.|$|R
50|$|We {{may assume}} that only finitely many lamps are lit at any time, since {{the action of}} any element of L changes at most finitely many <b>lamps.</b> The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> lit is, however, unbounded. The group action is thus similar to the action of a Turing machine.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatly reduced}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> may simplify {{maintenance}} and reduce installation costs {{but may also}} require a backup system for areas where lighting is critical. The light pipes allow the lamp {{to be placed in}} an easily accessible area for maintenance and away from places where the heat <b>of</b> the <b>lamp</b> may be a problem.|$|R

40|$|Residential {{lighting}} {{is one of}} important appliances that, in total, consume large amount of electricity. Establishment of residential lighting load curve is therefore prominent as the curve will be useful for any further analysis. Nevertheless, {{it is difficult to}} develop residential lighting load curve when the residential energy consumption is measured using conventional metering or other power monitoring device. This paper presents estimation of residential lighting load curve using Baseline Energy Use method. A survey has been conducted to collect relevant data of lighting utilization in Surabaya. Important findings from the survey include determination <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> each <b>lamp</b> type, average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> per household, total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> in households, and average daily operating hours. Considering a 96. 2 share of ownership which consist of incandescent, fluorescent, and compact fluorescent lamp, it is found from the analysis that the lighting peak load is occured at 7 PM with average wattage per household of 100. 1 W. Meanwhile, residential sectorâ€™s lighting peak load is reached 76. 3 MW. In addition, no coincidence found when the lighting load curve compared to the adjusted system loading curve...|$|R
50|$|In a sum of integers, the parity of the sum is not {{affected}} by the even terms in the sum; the overall sum is even {{when there is an}} <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> odd terms, and odd when there is an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> odd terms. Since one side of the degree sum formula is the <b>even</b> <b>number</b> 2|E|, the sum on the other side must have an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> odd terms; that is, there must be an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> odd-degree vertices.|$|R
50|$|The state S1 {{represents}} {{that there}} has been an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 0s in the input so far, while S2 signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 0s or not. If the input did contain an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 0s, M will finish in state S1, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.|$|R
50|$|Taking the odd {{permutations}} of {{the above}} coordinates with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one. Though {{it may not be}} immediately obvious, the figure obtained by taking the even permutations with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs is the same as that obtained by taking the odd permutations with an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs. Similarly, the mirror image has either an odd permutation with an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs or an even permutation with an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plus signs.|$|R

40|$|Almost Perfect Nonlinear(APN) S-boxes {{are used}} in block ciphers to prevent {{differential}} attacks. The non-evidence of permutation APN S-box on <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables and the efficiency of power functions bring the importance of power APN S-boxes to use in block ciphers. We present a special class of 3 -to- 1 S-box on <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables. The power APN S-boxes on <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables fall in this class. We study some other known APN S-boxes on <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables whether they fall in this class. Then we present {{a necessary condition for}} power functions to be APN. Using this necessary condition we can filter out some non-APN power functions. Specifically, if the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables is multiple of small primes, then one can filter many non-APN functions...|$|R
50|$|The {{examples}} below describes {{one approach}} for applying the Luhn algorithm {{on two different}} ISINs. The difference in the two examples {{has to do with}} if there are an odd or <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters will result in an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits and an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters will result in an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits. For an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> digits, the approach in the second example is used. The Luhn algorithm can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting {{from the end of the}} string), being more generic.|$|R
50|$|In an {{exceptionally}} difficult puzzle, one {{may use the}} Jordan curve theorem, which states that any open curve that starts and ends outside of a closed curve must intersect the closed curve an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times. In particular, this means that any row of the grid must have an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vertical lines and any column must have an <b>even</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horizontal lines. When only one potential line segment {{in one of these}} groups is unknown, you can determine whether {{it is part of the}} loop or not with this theorem.|$|R
