40|$|Abstract: One of the {{effective}} {{ways to improve the}} properties of special bitumens are their chemical and physical modification. When considering a chemical approach, we assumed that a process of oxidative polymerization is connected with radical-chain reactions. That is why when carrying out an oxidizing process of residual oil stock, it is necessary to use the modifiers, which are able to take part in this process, subjecting the segments of paraffin chains to chemical structuring with further formation of polycyclic naphthene-aromatic fragments, promoting the intense resin formation and preventing from the formation of the asphaltene crystalline phase. The analysis of physical-mechanical properties of bituminous insulating materials (BIM), based on acidified <b>flux</b> <b>oil,</b> showed the ambiguity of their assessment, i. e. at identical speeds of fuel-oil residues oxidation processes, there are differences in strength properties of coverings (C). The properties of air-blown asphaltic bitumen are regulated by resizing of the core and solvation shell of the complex structural unit (CSU) by injection of multicomponent bifunctional modifier (MBM), promoting the reduction of oxidation duration and the improvement of physical-mechanical and insulation properties of BIM.

The membrane performances were characterized in terms of pure water flux, permeate <b>flux,</b> and <b>oil</b> rejection, while the membrane morphologies were analyzed using scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The experimental results showed that when 2 wt. % TiO 2 was incorporated into PVDF membranes, optimized permeate <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> rejection of 70. 48 L/m(2) h (+/- 1. 41) and 99. 7 % (+/- 0. 3), respectively, could be obtained when tested using 250 ppm synthesized oily solution under vacuum condition.

40|$|In vapor {{compression}} {{cycles of}} {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration systems, {{a small amount of}} the compressor lubricating oil is carried with the refrigerant and it circulates in the system components. In the heat exchangers, oil is a contaminant and it decreases the heat transfer rate and increases the pressure losses: both are unavoidable challenges. Nanolubricants, that is, nanoparticles dispersed in the non-volatile component of a refrigerant and oil mixture and working as thermal energy transport vectors within the mixture, have the potential to overcome these challenges in a cost-neutral manner for both new and retrofitting applications. This papers documents the effects of the nanoparticles thermal conductivity and aspect ratio on the two-phase flow heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop of nanolubricants by experimentally studying two types of nanolubricants. The first type used spherical Alumina (Î³-Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles with 40 nm nominal particle diameter. The second type used ZnO nanoparticles with 20 to 40 nm nominal particle diameter and with an elongated hexagonal wurtzite shape. The experimental results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants increased linearly with the added amount of nanoparticles in POE oil, and Î³-Al 2 O 3 and ZnO based nanolubricants had similar thermal conductivity if the nanoparticle concentration was 10 wt. % and 20 wt. %. However, even when diluted in the liquid phase of the refrigerant R 410 A and POE oil mixture, these two types of nanoparticles provided heat transfer performance that were measurably different from each other during two phase flow boiling inside an horizontal 9. 5 mm micro-fin evaporator tube. Depending on the mass <b>flux,</b> <b>oil</b> concentration, and heat flux, nanolubricants provided either an enhancement or a degradation of the heat transfer coefficients. These results supported the hypothesis that thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants was not the main property responsible for the heat transfer coefficient intensification during flow boiling. The experimental results also suggested that the magnitude of the enhancements of the two phase flow boiling heat transfer coefficient due to the nanoparticles dispersed in the POE oil were depended on the mass flux and shear rates within the liquid phase of the mixture. Interesting, even when high heat transfer coefficients were observed for the nanolubricants, the effect of the nanoparticles on the two phase flow pressure drop of the mixture was negligible. ...|$|E

In the oil extraction process, solvent recovery is one point of major concern, due to its high energy consumption and oil quality losses. Those drawbacks can be partially overcome by integration of membrane technology to the usual solvent distillation step. The present work tested four ultrafiltration (UF) and one nanofiltration (NF) membrane (Microdyn-Nadir) on the solvent recovery of synthetic mixtures of macauba oil and n-hexane. Membranes were pre-treated before use with different solvents in specific time lengths, according to preliminary studies. The membrane performance was evaluated by permeate <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> retention. Macauba (pulp and kernel) oil was evaluated by determinations of acidity, peroxide value and fatty acid profile. Membranes showed usual flux behaviour, compatible with other studies concerning oil/solvent mixtures permeation, although its values were quite above the expected. Best results for retention (> 30 %) are related to the membranes with lower molar mass cut-off (MMCO), and the best balance between permeate <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> retention was found for the NF membrane (12. 4 gm− 2 h− 1, 34. 7 %) ...|$|R

The membrane performances were characterized in terms of pure water flux, permeate <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> rejection while the membrane morphological properties were studied using SEM and AFM. PVDF-TiO 2 composite membrane prepared from PVP 40 k was found as the optimum membrane due to its high flux and high rejection during filtration process, recording 45 L/m 2. h and 80 % respectively, when tested using 250 ppm oily solution under submerged condition. The experimental results demonstrated that with increasing Mw of PVP, PVDF-TiO 2 membrane had higher protein rejection, smaller porosity and smoother surface layer. With increasing oil concentration from 250 to 1000 ppm, the permeate flux of the PVDF-PVP 40 k was obviously decreased while the oil rejection was gradually increased due to the additional selective layer formed on the membrane surface.

40|$|Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) {{and rubber}} (Hevea brasiliensis) {{plantations}} cover {{large areas of}} former rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia, supplying the global demand for these crops. Although forest conversion is known to influence soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitric oxide (NO) <b>fluxes,</b> measurements from <b>oil</b> palm and rubber plantations are scarce (for N 2 O) or nonexistent (for NO). Our study aimed to (1)  quantify changes in soil–atmosphere fluxes of N oxides with forest conversion to rubber and oil palm plantations and (2)  determine their controlling factors. In Jambi, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes that mainly differed in texture but were both on heavily weathered soils: loam and clay Acrisol soils. Within each landscape, we investigated lowland forests, rubber trees interspersed in secondary forest (termed as jungle rubber), both as reference land uses and smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations as converted land uses. In the loam Acrisol landscape, we conducted a follow-on study in a large-scale oil palm plantation (called PTPN VI) for comparison of soil N 2 O <b>fluxes</b> with smallholder <b>oil</b> palm plantations. Land-use conversion to smallholder plantations {{had no effect on}} soil N-oxide fluxes (P [*]=[*] 0. [*] 58 to 0. 76) due to the generally low soil N availability in the reference land uses that further decreased with land-use conversion. Soil N 2 O fluxes from the large-scale oil palm plantation did not differ with those from smallholder plantations (P [*]=[*] 0. [*] 15). Over 1 -year measurements, the temporal patterns of soil N-oxide fluxes were influenced by soil mineral N and water contents. Across landscapes, annual soil N 2 O emissions were controlled by gross nitrification and sand content, which also suggest the influence of soil N and water availability. Soil N 2 O fluxes (µg N m − 2  h − 1) were 7  ±  2 to 14  ±  7 (reference land uses), 6  ±  3 to 9  ±  2 (rubber), 12  ±  3 to 12  ±  6 (smallholder oil palm) and 42  ±  24 (large-scale oil palm). Soil NO fluxes (µg N m − 2  h − 1) were − 0. 6  ±  0. 7 to 5. 7  ±  5. 8 (reference land uses), − 1. 2  ±  0. 5 to − 1. 0  ±  0. 2 (rubber) and − 0. 2  ±  1. 2 to 0. 7  ±  0. 7 (smallholder oil palm).

Tests were conducted using both refined oils and crude oil. During low salinity waterflooding, a salinity gradient was set up between low salinity water injected through a fracture and a porous network partially saturated with high salinity brine. Primary drained oil acted as a semi-permeable membrane between the two aqueous phases. As part of a recently started CO 2 project, experiments involved injection of liquid and supercritical CO 2 through tight shale cores to produce oil primarily by molecular diffusion. Osmotic diffusion in presence of a salinity gradient resulted in increased water <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> mobilization, visualized within separate pores and in networks of interconnected pores.

The influence of transmembrane pressure (TMP), disk rotating speed, and disk geometry on permeate <b>flux</b> and <b>oil</b> recovery has been studied. Hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes with average pore size 0. 15 mu m and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes with 50 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) were used. The results showed that the rotating disk module can produce high permeate fluxes. The highest permeate fluxes were obtained when using a rotating disk equipped with vanes, which generated the largest shear rates at the membrane. This study demonstrated that hydrophilic membranes were suitable for demulsification of linseed oil-in-water emulsion. The linseed oil droplets in the emulsions could be separated by concentration tests due to the coalescence of oil droplets in the concentration polarization layer. For an initial oil mass of 46. 5 g, 35. 2 g supernatant oil was obtained owing to oil droplets coalescence. This supernatant oil represented a recovery of 76 %. The rotating disk with vanes consumed less specific energy than smooth disk in the concentration tests. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The conventional method of providing bituminous surfacing on flexible pavements require significant amount of energy for production of bituminous binder from crude petroleum, drying aggregates and subsequently production of bituminous mix at hot mix plant (HMP). Hot mix recycling is the process in which reclaimed asphalt pavement materials are combined with new materials, sometimes along with a recycling agent, to produce hot mix asphalt mixtures. When properly designed, recycled mixtures can have better or similar performance to those of new conventional hot mix asphalt mixtures. Recycling or Rejuvenating agents have been defined as organic materials with chemical and physical characteristics selected to restore properties of aged asphalt to desired specifications. In selecting the recycling agent, the viscosity characteristics of the combined aged asphalt binder and the recycling agent are the determining factors. These agents are also known as softening agents, reclaiming agents, modifiers, <b>fluxing</b> <b>oils,</b> extender oils, and aromatic oils. The choice of Recycling Agent (RA) grade will depend on the amount and hardness of the asphalt in the aged pavement. In general, the lower viscosity RA types can be used to restore aged asphalts of high viscosity and vice versa. Laboratory studies have been carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP material and rejuvenating agent and their performance has been compared with virgin asphalt mixes. Various performance tests such as Retained Stability, Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), Creep test, beam fatigue test, resilient modulus and wheel tracking test has been carried out to compare the performance properties. This paper presents the results of all such performance tests carried out on asphalt mixes with RAP and virgin mixes.

N loss has a major environmental impact during cultivation. For instance, 48. 7 % of the greenhouse gases emitted to produce 1 t of palm oil fruit are due to N fertilization. Actually, there is little comprehensive knowledge on how to calculate N budgets in oil palm plantation in order to optimize fertilization, taking into account N leaching and N gases emissions. Here we modeled knowledge about all N <b>fluxes</b> in an <b>oil</b> palm field following standard management practices of industrial plantations, on a mineral soil, from planting to felling after a 25 -year-growth cycle. The largest fluxes are internal <b>fluxes,</b> such as <b>oil</b> palm uptake, with 40 – 380 kg N ha− 1 year− 1, and the decomposition of felled palms {{at the end of the}} cycle, with 465 – 642 kg N ha− 1. The largest losses are emissions of NH 3 and leaching of NO 3 −, corresponding to 0. 1 – 42 % and 1 – 34 % of mineral N applied, respectively. The most uncertain and least documented fluxes are N losses such as N 2 O, NO x, N 2 emissions, leaching, NH 3 volatilization, and runoff. The most critical conditions for N losses occur during the immature phase when young palms uptake is low and during the mature phase in areas with sparse soil cover or receiving high amounts of fertilizers.

In periods of high rainfall, plants in valleys and at riparian sites {{are more prone}} to flooding than plants at elevated topographic positions. We asked to what extent topographic position and flooding affect oil palm and rubber tree water use patterns and thereby influence spatial and temporal heterogeneity of transpiration. In an undulating terrain in the lowlands of Jambi, Indonesia, plantations of the two species were studied in plot pairs consisting of upland and adjacent valley plots. All upland plots were non-flooded, whereas the corresponding valley plots included non-flooded, long-term flooded, and short-term flooded conditions. Within each plot pair, sap flux densities in palms or trees were monitored simultaneously with thermal dissipation probes. In plot pairs with non-flooded valleys, sap <b>flux</b> densities of <b>oil</b> palms were only slightly different between the topographic positions, whereas sap flux densities of rubber trees were higher in the valley than at the according upland site. In pairs with long-term flooded valleys, sap flux densities in valleys were lower than at upland plots for both species, but the reduction was far less pronounced in oil palms than in rubber trees (- 22 and - 45 % in maximum sap flux density, respectively). At these long-term flooded valley plots palm and tree water use also responded less sensitively to fluctuations in micrometeorological variables than at upland plots. In short-term flooded valley plots, sap <b>flux</b> densities of <b>oil</b> palm were hardly affected by flooding, but sap flux densities of rubber trees were reduced considerably. Topographic position and flooding thus affected water use patterns in both oil palms and rubber trees, but the changes in rubber trees were much more pronounced: compared to non-flooded upland sites, the different flooding conditions at valley sites amplified the observed heterogeneity of plot mean water use by a factor of 2. 4 in oil palm and by a factor of 4. 2 in rubber plantations. Such strong differences between species as well as the pronounced heterogeneity of water use across space and time may be of relevance for eco-hydrological assessments of tropical plantation landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Expansion of {{palm oil}} and rubber production, for which global demand is increasing, causes rapid {{deforestation}} in Sumatra, Indonesia, {{and is expected}} to continue in the next decades. Our study aimed to (1) quantify changes in soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes with land-use change and (2) determine their controlling factors. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes on heavily weathered soils that differ mainly in texture: loam and clay Acrisol soils. In each landscape, we investigated the reference land-use types (forest and secondary forest with regenerating rubber) and the converted land-use types (rubber, 7 – 17 years old, and oil palm plantations, 9 – 16 years old). We measured soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes monthly from December 2012 to December 2013. Annual soil CO 2 fluxes from the reference land-use types were correlated with soil fertility: low extractable phosphorus (P) coincided with high annual CO 2 fluxes from the loam Acrisol soil that had lower fertility than the clay Acrisol soil (P < 0. 05). Soil CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> from the <b>oil</b> palm (107. 2 to 115. 7 mg C m − 2 h − 1) decreased compared to the other land-use types (between 178. 7 and 195. 9 mg C m − 2 h − 1; P < 0. 01). Across land-use types, annual CO 2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (C) and negatively correlated with 15 N signatures, extractable P and base saturation. This suggests that the reduced soil CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> from <b>oil</b> palm were the result of strongly decomposed soil organic matter and reduced soil C stocks due to reduced litter input as well as being due to a possible reduction in C allocation to roots due to improved soil fertility from liming and P fertilization in these plantations. Soil CH 4 uptake in the reference land-use types was negatively correlated with net nitrogen (N) mineralization and soil mineral N, suggesting N limitation of CH 4 uptake, and positively correlated with exchangeable aluminum (Al), indicating a decrease in methanotrophic activity at high Al saturation. Reduction in soil CH 4 uptake in the converted land-use types (ranging from − 3. 0 to − 14. 9 μg C m − 2 h − 1) compared to the reference land-use types (ranging from − 20. 8 to − 40. 3 μg C m − 2 h − 1; P < 0. 01) was due to a decrease in soil N availability in the converted land-use types. Our study shows {{for the first time that}} differences in soil fertility control the soil–atmosphere exchange of CO 2 and CH 4 in a tropical landscape, a mechanism that we were able to detect by conducting this study on the landscape scale...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first direct eddy {{covariance}} fluxes of reactive biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs) from oil palms to the atmosphere using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), measured at a plantation in Malaysian Borneo. At midday, net isoprene flux constituted the largest fraction (84 %) of all emitted BVOCs measured, at up to 30 mg m − 2 h − 1 over 12 days. By contrast, {{the sum of its}} oxidation products methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) exhibited clear deposition of 1 mg m − 2 h − 1, with a small average canopy resistance of 230 s m − 1. Approximately 15 % of the resolved BVOC <b>flux</b> from <b>oil</b> palm trees could be attributed to floral emissions, which are thought to be the largest reported biogenic source of estragole and possibly also toluene. Although on average the midday volume mixing ratio of estragole exceeded that of toluene by almost a factor of two, the corresponding fluxes of these two compounds were nearly the same, amounting to 0. 81 and 0. 76 mg m − 2 h − 1, respectively. By fitting the canopy temperature and PAR response of the MEGAN emissions algorithm for isoprene and other emitted BVOCs a basal emission rate of isoprene of 7. 8 mg m − 2 h − 1 was derived. We parameterise fluxes of depositing compounds using a resistance approach using direct canopy measurements of deposition. Consistent with Karl et al. (2010), we also propose {{that it is important to}} include deposition in flux models, especially for secondary oxidation products, in order to improve flux predictions...|$|R
40|$|A small (1 L) batch stirred {{cell system}} has been {{developed}} to study crude oil fouling at surface temperatures up to 400 degrees C and pressures up to 30 bar. Fouling resistance-time data are obtained from experiments in which the principal operating variables are surface shear stress, surface temperature, heat <b>flux,</b> and crude <b>oil</b> type. The oils and deposits are characterized and correlated with the experimental heat transfer fouling data to understand better the effects of process conditions such as surface temperature and surface shear stress on the fouling process. Deposits are subjected {{to a range of}} qualitative and quantitative analyses in order to gain a better insight into the crude oil fouling phenomenon. Thermal data that can be obtained relatively quickly from the batch cell provide fouling rates, Arrhenius plots, and apparent activation energies as a function of process variables. The experimental system, supported by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies, allows fouling threshold conditions of surface temperature and shear stress to be identified relatively quickly in the laboratory. The data also contribute to existing knowledge about the compensation plot...|$|R
40|$|Multi-phase flow {{modeling}} has {{the potential}} to illuminate the processes by which hydrocarbons are emplaced during secondary migration. An analytical and numerical model of multi-phase flow is presented to describe the relationship between secondary migration through fault zones and the concurrent charging of reservoirs in juxtaposition with these faults. The reservoir hydrocarbon column heights that result from this process are controlled by the petrophysical properties of the fault zone, the flux of water and hydrocarbons in the fault zone, and the geometry of the reservoir. At steady state, the capillary pressure between the fluid phases must be equal in the fault zone and the reservoir. This capillary pressure determines the hydrocarbon column height in the reservoir. Key results of the modeling are: 1) For a given <b>oil</b> <b>flux,</b> the presence of a dynamic water phase in the fault zone will decrease the oil column height in the reservoir. The amount of decrease will be directly dependent on the water potential gradient in the fault. 2) Three phase oil and gas column heights are a dynamic functio...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} polar {{components}} in crude oil can be adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} nanopores and this part of oil is not easy to flow. Therefore, these polar components can be regarded as a part of the shale formation (Schwark et al. 1997; Qin et al. 2000; Pan et al. 2005; Cui et al. 2017). Cui et al. (2017) presented an analytical model for oil transport estimation in nanopores of oil shale with consideration of van der Waals adsorption (McGonigal et al. 1990), and compared the contributions of slip factor and adsorption factor on the flow enhancement. Besides, Cui et al. (2017) found the contribution of physical adsorption is negligible compared with slip flow, which is in agreement with water transport behaviors in carbon nanotubes (Kondratyuk and Yates 2007). For liquid flow through nanopores, the adsorption phenomenon is extremely important, which has an obvious influence on the flow enhancement (Wu et al. 2017). The adsorption region is the area where some layers of fluid are stuck to the nanopore walls and its physical parameters are significantly different from that of bulk liquid (Do and Do 2005; Severson and Snurr 2007; Sha et al. 2008). Riewchotisakul and Akkutlu (2016) presented a model for gas transport in nanopores of shale with consideration of physical adsorption. However, the physical parameters of gas are significantly different from that of liquid. Despite this, the studies on gas transport revealed the importance of physical adsorption on fluid transport at nanoscale (Akkutlu et al. 2012; Deng et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015 a, b; Wu et al. 2015). Zhang et al. (2017 a) presented a model for predicting the volume <b>flux</b> of <b>oil</b> in nanopores of shale. However, their model failed to take the effect of oil–wall interaction on the viscosity of oil in the adsorption region into consideration.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} two-dimensional {{model to}} predict the heat and mass transfer that occur during the vacuum frying of potato chips was solved using the Finite Element toolbox in MATLAB 6. 1. The simulation of the heat transfer process included the convection of heat from the surface to the product, the conduction of heat into the product, {{and a loss of}} heat using the heat source term representing evaporation. The mass transfer process was divided into two periods: (1) water loss and (2) oil absorption. The first scenario included a diffusion term and a source term. The source term represented the convection and evaporation of water from the product. For the second period, the diffusion term represented the gradual absorption of oil through capillary diffusion. From the simulation, a good agreement between the experimental data and the predicted values was obtained. From the heat transfer model, the rapid increase in temperature of the product toward the boiling point of water (at the associated pressure) followed by its steady increase toward the temperature of the oil was validated. Furthermore, by separating the rate of moisture loss into two parts to represent the constant rate and falling rate period of drying, the model was able to predict an initial period of rapid moisture loss followed by a decreasing rate of moisture loss. The simulation also demonstrated the formation of the crust and the gradual movement of the crust inward. Finally, using two sets of diffusion coefficients that correlated to the two schemes of moisture loss, the model predicted the rapid <b>flux</b> of <b>oil</b> into the product during the constant drying stage, followed by a small amount of oil absorption into its interior once the crust had been established...|$|R
