40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} work spaces designed based on Activity-Centered Ergonomics. The aim was {{to reflect on the}} role of Ergonomics in the design of productive situations in order to anticipate and mitigate the emergence of new constraints. This study was developed using a case study from the packaging industry, where an automated line was implemented to mitigate the injuries suffered as result of the manual system. This article was {{based on the results of}} an Ergonomic Work Analysis of the solution implemented, and the subsequent analysis of this design process. It was found that the adopted solution does not have enough leeway for dealing with variations inherent to the process, requiring constant interventions in the operation, by the operators in order to <b>free</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> continue work. It was evident that the adopted solution did not involve the participation of important agents such as the operators and the maintenance crew, giving the project a technical vision that was concerned with eliminating the human factor. The conclusion of this study was that the Ergonomics integrated into the project development favors the collective construction of analysis of the research, and consequently, the development of more effective solutions...|$|E

5000|$|Many popular zones (such as the 2-3, 3-2 and 1-2-2) have {{a gap in}} {{the middle}} of the lane. Getting the ball in this area can be very {{effective}} because the defense is often forced to [...] "collapse" [...] on <b>the</b> ball handler, <b>freeing</b> up other players for open shots. To exploit this gap, many teams assign a forward to operate in the [...] "high post" [...] area near <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> catch and distribute the ball. A forward in the high post area can also set screens on the players at the top of the zone to allow penetration by the guards.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} that the triple team fails and the high post is able to make a pass to the wing the defender closest to the ball must sprint out to defend it. The defender that started {{guarding}} the high post then retreats to the post while the defender playing {{on the side of the}} lane closest to the ball sprints out and defends the pass to the corner. The last defender left that was previously triple teaming stays at <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> deny <b>the</b> post and the defender playing on the opposite side of the lane drops under the basket. The defender now denying the pass to the high post now has to deny passes to the high post, wing and cross court. It is critical that the players denying passes to the high post and wing in this situation are your quickest players.|$|R
50|$|A two guard {{front is}} a {{different}} offensive formation in which two players begin {{at the top of}} the key, one player plays the high post and the other two players are positioned just above the baseline outside <b>the</b> three-point <b>line.</b> When defending against a two guard front in the amoeba defense the formation changes from a diamond shape to a 2-1-2 defense. The top two defenders who we first stacked at <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> and top of the key come up to defend the two guards. The defender under the basket then comes up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> and guards behind the high post. While the defenders on either side of the lane stay put to guard the pass to the corner. Ideally the ball handler would pass the ball to the high post. In that situation both defenders up top both drop down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> triple team <b>the</b> high post. The high post would, in the perfect situation, panic and make a bad pass. The two defenders down low should then anticipate the pass and intercept it.|$|R

25|$|In this double-overtime thriller, Kentucky {{started out}} well and led Michigan State by four at halftime, but Michigan State {{caught up in}} the second half, {{actually}} leading 70-62 with 5:43 to play. Kentucky rallied back, however, cutting the lead to one when Kelenna Azubuike drained a three with 1:19 to play. After Patrick Sparks missed the front end of a one-and-one with 41 seconds to play, Michigan State's Shannon Brown appeared to ice the game with two free throws with 20 seconds to play. But with time expiring, Sparks put up a prayer from three, and the ball bounced around the rim four times before falling in. After the referees spent nearly ten minutes reviewing the play, they upheld that Sparks' shot was a three pointer, sending the game into overtime. In the first overtime, neither team relented, and Brown hit a key three-point basket for Michigan State to keep them in the game. Kentucky's Azubuike missed a three as time expired to send the game into double overtime. In the second overtime, Michigan State's mettle finally won the game for them, as they scored 11 of their 13 points from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> finally seal <b>the</b> game and send them to the Final Four for the fourth time under coach Tom Izzo.|$|R
50|$|Brent Barry was {{selected}} by the Denver Nuggets {{in the first round}} (15th pick) of the 1995 NBA draft, but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on draft night in a 4-player trade with Rodney Rogers for the No. 2 overall pick in the draft (Antonio McDyess) and Randy Woods. Barry was generally considered a good passer and had three seasons where he averaged more than 5 assists per game. Barry was also a strong three-point shooter; he currently ranks 13th all-time in career three-point field goals made and shot 40% from behind the arc for his career. These two strengths, combined with Barry's 6 ft 7 in frame, allowed him to play a variety of positions, including point guard, shooting guard, and small forward; because he was taller than most traditional point guards, he was often considered a point forward when he was running the offense. He was on the San Antonio Spurs championship teams in 2005 and 2007. He won the Slam Dunk Contest in the NBA All-Star Weekend in 1996 with a Julius Erving-inspired slam dunk in which he took off from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> sail in and dunk one-handed. He was the first caucasian player to win the competition.|$|R

25|$|The Spurs and Heat would {{alternate}} {{wins the}} first six games in the series. In Game 6, the Spurs {{were on the verge}} of winning their fifth NBA title. San Antonio was up five points with 28 seconds to go in regulation. An unlikely and uncharacteristic series of mishaps would doom the Spurs down the stretch, including the benching of Duncan by Popovich at the end of regulation with the Spurs on defense. The Heat missed their field goal attempt, but the undersized Spurs could not grab the defensive rebound. Chris Bosh rebounded the ball and Ray Allen then hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with five seconds left in regulation to send it to overtime, during which the Spurs were defeated 103–100. In Game 7, San Antonio jumped out to a lead early and kept the game close the entire way. Toward the end of the game, however, and despite a 24-point, 12 rebound effort, Duncan failed to convert on two attempts to tie the game: a missed layup and missed tip-in that allowed LeBron James to hit a jumper and increase the Heat's lead to 92–88. After a steal from Ginóbili, James hit two free throws after being fouled by Duncan, and when Ginóbili missed a subsequent 3-pointer, Dwyane Wade hit one out of two from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> game on ice, as the Heat would win their second straight championship.|$|R
50|$|Charlton {{started their}} Premiership {{campaign}} at Bolton. Both teams {{were hoping to}} improve on last season's respectful positions, with Bolton finishing eighth and Charlton seventh the previous season, and to also show their European credentials, but it just looked like one team would be on today's showing. Kevin Davies was denied by Dean Kiely after just 30 seconds to show the tough day the Addicks would have. Shaun Bartlett fouled Kevin Davies and Jay-Jay Okocha, who had gone the previous season without scoring, scored an early contender for goal {{of the season with}} a rasping 30-yard free kick which left Kiely clutching thin air. It was two shortly afterwards when Okocha turned from scorer to provider as his precise through ball found Henrik Pedersen, who held off Luke Young and slotted past Kiely. Kevin Lisbie then missed a glorious chance for the visitors when from six yards out, his shot was blocked by Jussi Jääskeläinen. Charlton improved in the second half but couldn't take their chances, with Shaun Bartlett and debutant Danny Murphy missing good opportunities, and that allowed Bolton to seal the game when Okocha scored an incredible second when he teased the Charlton defenders before unleashing a powerful drive past the helpless Dean Kiely. Bartlett then cleared an Okocha <b>free</b> kick off <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> Nigerian an amazing hat-trick of long range strikes. Eventually, Charlton got on the score sheet when a Danny Murphy free kick was headed home by Lisbie. But {{it was too late for}} a comeback and in the end Pedersen scored his second of the day when Gary Speed played him through and the Danish striker did the rest.|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles shot {{poorly in}} the early going, and the Celtics jumped out to a first-quarter 24-12 lead which was cut to 59-56 at halftime. Then, Celtics sixth man Don Nelson scored 12 points in the third quarter, while the Lakers hardly {{connected}} on a quarter of their field goal attempts: the Celtics led 91-76 after the third. Early in the fourth quarter, Chamberlain incurred his fifth foul (he had never fouled out of a game in his career) and had to play more tentative defense. Then with just over 5 minutes remaining and the Lakers trailing 103-96, Chamberlain landed awkwardly when grabbing a rebound {{and came to the}} bench with an injured knee. Behind backup center Mel Counts, the Lakers cut the lead to 103-102 with two minutes left. Chamberlain then informed Van Breda Kolff that he was ready to return, but the coach infamously told the superstar center [...] "we're doing fine without you" [...] and Chamberlain never got back in the game. Boston still had that 103-102 lead with 1:33 left in the game when reserve guard Keith Erickson knocked the ball away from John Havlicek. The ball went right to Don Nelson, who put up a desperation 18 foot shot from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> beat <b>the</b> 24 second clock; the ball hit the back rim, bounced high in the air and fell through the hoop to give Boston a 105-102 lead. The Lakers committed costly turnovers in the last moments and trailed 108-104 before making a meaningless last second shot that made the final score 108-106.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a pass to}} {{the block}} is not possible, the second option is either to pass to the weak-side guard who flashes top of the key from the weak-side wing {{position}} or passing to the strong-side corner. If the ball is passed to the corner the options are either shoot, pass to the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is passed to the weak-side guard it initiates the [...] "pinch post" [...] option. There are two options. The first and most common is to pass to the weak-side forward who flashes to the elbow (corner of the key at <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line)</b> <b>to</b> receive <b>the</b> pass. When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is {{there are so many}} weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the wing sets a screen for the corner guard on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can pass to the corner guard coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the corner guard can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.|$|R
40|$|Problems with {{pipeline}} plugs at Hanford {{have occurred}} throughout its tank farm system. Most cross-site transfer lines at Hanford {{are no longer}} functional due to these plugs. Waste transfers frequently led <b>to</b> partial <b>line</b> plugs, resulting in substantial amounts of water being added to the tank system in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>free</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> In response <b>to</b> these plugs, the Hanford tank farm developed waste acceptance criteria that a waste must pass {{before it can be}} transferred (Shekarriz et al., 1997). The criteria, which include physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity, and percent solids, are based primarily on past operational experience. Unfortunately, the chemistry of the waste solutions {{was not included in the}} criteria even though the tank farm operators are fully aware of its importance. Pipeline plugs have also occurred during relatively short waste transfers at Hanford. In FY 2000, the effort to saltwell pump 50, 000 gal of filtered waste from tank U- 103 to tank SY- 102 was delayed for several weeks due to a plugged pipeline. Attempts to locate the plug(s) determined that it had occurred in the 02 -A flex and that other plugs were possible in each of the SY-farm flexes. Modifications such as larger flex jumpers and additional heat tracing were made to the transfer system. The plug was probably attributable to a reduction in the temperature of the waste in the pipeline. The waste in tank U- 103 was approximately 30 C prior to the transfer. During tests on actual waste from tank U- 103 (Herting, 1999), trisodium phosphate solids were observed at temperatures as high as 20 C after a 50 % dilution with water. Therefore, the following precautions (Herting, 1999) were recommended during the saltwell pumping of tank U- 103. First, the tank waste should not be heated prior to the transfer. Second, the waste should not be permitted to cool during the transfer. Third, the waste should be kept moving during the transfer. A previous Tanks Focus Area (TFA) study (Hunt et al., 1999) clearly demonstrated the need to maintain the temperature of the waste in this range. Even small reductions in the temperature of simulated wastes from 35 to 30 C and from 30 to 25 C led to high-viscosity solids that could easily plug a pipeline...|$|R

5000|$|The Timberwolves' {{trade of}} Jefferson before the 2010-11 NBA season was {{expected}} to result in more playing time for Love. However, he averaged 28 minutes through the first nine games, exceeding 30 minutes only twice. Chris Mannix of SI.com wrote that many speculated there was a rift between coach Kurt Rambis and Love. In a home game against the New York Knicks on November 12, 2010, Love became the 19th player to record a [...] "30-30" [...] game, when he recorded 31 points along with a career-high 31 rebounds. His 31 rebounds set a Timberwolves franchise record and were also the most by a player in an NBA game since Charles Barkley recorded 33 rebounds in a game in 1996. Love became {{the first player to}} record a 30-30 game since Moses Malone in 1982. [...] Love scored a career-high 43 points and had 17 rebounds on December 18 in a 115-113 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On February 4, 2011, Love was selected by Commissioner David Stern to his first NBA All-Star Game as replacement for the injured Yao Ming. The day before, Love was not selected as an All-Star as a reserve although averaging 21.4 points, a league-best 15.5 rebounds, shooting 43.9 percent from 3-point range, and having 34 straight double-doubles for the 11-37 Timberwolves. On February 8, Love set a team record (previously held by Kevin Garnett) with his 38th consecutive double-double after scoring 20 points and recording 14 rebounds in the Timberwolves' 112-108 win over the Houston Rockets. He scored 37 points and had 23 rebounds on February 27 in a 126-123 win over the Golden State Warriors. It was his fourth 30-point, 20-rebound game of the season, and Love went 18 for 23 from <b>the</b> <b>free</b> throw <b>line</b> <b>to</b> tie Minnesota's team records for made and attempted free throws. On March 13, Love's consecutive double-double streak ended at 53 games in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. It was the longest streak since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976, surpassing Malone's 51-game streak from 1979 to 1980. Love was two short of Elvin Hayes's streak of 55 consecutive double-doubles set in the 1973-74 season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilt Chamberlain holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967. The NBA does not recognize the double-double as an official statistic. Love suffered a strained left groin on March 20 against Sacramento. He missed the final six games and nine of the last 11 games of the season due to the injury.|$|R
