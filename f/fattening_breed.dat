Every mechanical artifice, every chemically pure substance employed in manufacture, every abnormally fertile race of plants, or rapidly growing and <b>fattening</b> <b>breed</b> of animals, {{is a part of}} the new Nature created by science. Without it, the most densely populated regions of modern Europe and America must retain their primitive, sparsely inhabited, agricultural or pastoral condition; it is the foundation of our wealth and the condition of our safety from submergence by another flood of barbarous hordes; it is the bond which unites into a solid political whole, regions larger than any empire of antiquity; it secures us from the recurrence of the pestilences and famines of former times; it is the source of endless comforts and conveniences, which are not mere luxuries, but conduce to physical and moral well-being. During the last fifty years, this new birth of time, this new Nature begotten by science upon fact, has pressed itself daily and hourly upon our attention, and has worked miracles which have modified the whole fashion of our lives.|$|E

40|$|Vegetarianism and Veganism {{have become}} the subject of public debate. But even a {{vegetarian}} diet including milk products results in the slaughtering of cows after their productive life and in the slaughtering of <b>fattened</b> male <b>breed</b> cattle. Narrative and semi-structured interviews were conducted on 5 farms that do not slaughter their cattle. These farms were either certified as organic farms, or are former organic farms or strongly oriented toward organic farming. Subsequently the interviews were analysed applying Grounded Theory. The emerging four principles of a care-system for healthy, handicapped, old, ill and dying cattle are described and related to the IFOAM principles. Further on innovations leading to this care-system and the main challenges it faces are elaborated. Cattle husbandry without slaughtering, that includes sanctuaries and farms which milk their cows is an emerging innovative example of an ethical choice that has {{the life of the}} animals as its main “product” and milk rather as a by-product...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} leptin gene single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) on cattle internal environment indicators were evaluated. In experiment 58 Czech Pied bulls divided in three groups (TT, CT and CC) according to leptin SNP were investigated. Serum leptin, insulin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, triacylglycerols and non-esterified fatty acids concentrations were measured. No significant differences in serum T 3, T 4, TAG and NEFA concentrations between experimental groups, were found. Significantly higher concentration of serum insulin was recorded in group of TT bulls compared to CT a CC genotype. No effect of SNP of leptin gene on leptin serum concentration was recorded. No significant correlations between monitored hormones and metabolites in serum of Czech Pied bulls were found. Some differences in comparison with results found in other studies could be given by differences in <b>fattening</b> capacities particular <b>breeds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{establish}} the fattening aptitudes of male Norwegian White x Turcana hybrid young sheep compared to Turcana young sheep, fattening trial was developed during 79 days. Twelve hybrid and twelve Turcana young male sheep were used, and 5 heads of those were slaughtered {{in the end of}} the fattening time interval. During the <b>fattening</b> trial, both <b>breed</b> structures were maintained in the same conditions, and received the same food. The differences between the average values recorded in Norwegian White x Turcana male young sheep hybrids and Turcana male young sheep are positive and statistically assured at different significance thresholds for the weight in the end of the fattening time interval (+ 4. 63 kg), total gain (+ 2. 29 kg) and average daily gain (+ 29. 42 g), slaughtering weight (+ 5. 56 kg) and warm carcass weight (+ 4. 26 kg) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} past {{literature}} revealed inconsistencies in recommended feed particle size for optimal growth and productive performance of rabbits. Changing diet formulation and subsequent processing conditions may improve pellet texture and potentially affect rabbit performance. In the current study, two isoenergetic and isonitrogenous pelleted diets were formulated, which varied in the particle {{size of the}} concentrates (2 and 8 mm, respectively). The objective was to evaluate the effect of different particle sizes of compound diets on performance, nutrient utilisation, gut morphology, and carcass characteristics of <b>fattening</b> Italian White <b>breed</b> rabbits. The finely ground diet led to a significant improvement in feed efficiency and apparent digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre and NDF, without any negative effect on gut morphology. Furthermore, a smaller particle size of concentrates in pelleted diets improved carcass traits. Meat colour parameters showed significant differences in longissimus lumborum and biceps femoris due to dietary treatments, but in both muscles pH values 1 h and 24 h after slaughter remained unchanged. It is concluded that a finely ground pelleted diet {{can be used to}} improve growth performance of rabbits without affecting carcass parameters...|$|R
40|$|Objective of this {{research}} was to present and compare results of the research of the effect of two fattening methods, on deep litter and conventional method (without litter). Slaughter properties have been determined with special focus on distribution of certain tissues in pig carcasses fattened in two different ways. Research was carried out on meat, <b>fattening</b> pig <b>breeds</b> - Swedish landrace. Research included 115 fatteners from single farm in Vojvodina. Depending on the housing conditions, two groups were formed: first group - group I (60 heads in group) was housed on deep litter, and the second - group II (55 heads in group), without litter. At the end of the trial, pigs were slaughtered and dissection was performed on cooled (+ 4 ºC) left carcass sides and meat yield determined using the method of partial dissection (Walstra and Merkus, 1996). Carcass sides were cut in 12 parts. Based on the meat quantity in four main carcass parts: leg, shoulder, back-loin part (BLP) and belly-rib part (BRP), which contain 75 % of total musculature mass and mass of tenderloin of carcass side, meat percentage in carcass sides was calculated according to formulation (Manojlović Danica et al., 1999). Fatteners housed on deep litter had statistically significantly (**p< 0. 01) lower mass of cool carcass sides (38. 38 kg) compared to fatteners housed without litter (40. 90 kg). Higher absolute and relative shares of leg (10. 22 kg and 25. 02 %) were established and higher absolute yield of shoulder (5. 35 kg) in fatteners housed in boxes without litter (II group). Yield of muscle tissue in leg, shoulder, BLP and BRP was higher in fatteners of the II group (without litter) compared to pigs fattened on deep litter, and also statistically highly significant differences were established in share of muscle tissue in shoulder (**p< 0. 01) and considerable differences in regard to share of muscle tissue in BRP (*p< 0. 05). Meat yield of pig carcass sides was determined by method of partial dissection, for fatteners housed on deep litter it was 47, 92 %, and in case of fatteners housed without litter it was 53. 89 %. Established differences were very significant (**p< 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|Cattle husbandryhas a long {{tradition}} in the Czech Republic agriculture. Husbandry of dairy cattle is being replaced by husbandry of beef breeds andits count has been increasing in recent years. Approximately 191 thousand of suckler cow was kept on 1 st April 2014 according toCzech Statistical Office. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to analyse beef performance of <b>fattening</b> beef <b>breeds,</b> specifically crossbreds of charolais and piemontese breed, where asconditions under which fattening happened were same. The evaluation of chosen performance traits was carried out on 44 crossbreds from Old Town farm located near city of Frýdek-Místek. Groups of bulls were created according to the breed and year of slaughter. The slaughter age, live weight, carcass weight, net gain, average daily gain, and SEUROP system classification into meatiness and fat cover classes. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and StatsoftStatistica. T-test {{was used to assess}} significance of differences. The slaughter weight of charolais crossbreds was 636. 97 (slaughter age 728. 91 days), with piemontese crossbreds 639. 17 kg (slaughter age 736. 52 days). Minimal difference was found at carcass weight (357. 85 kg in charolais, 359. 08 kg in piemontese respectively). Average daily gains were also balanced 818. 61 g (charolais) and 814. 86 g (piemontese). Net gain difference was also low, net gain of charolais crossbreds was 490. 74 g per day respectively 488. 31 g per day within group of piemontese crossbreds. Differences between breeds were not statistically significant. The difference between slaughter year (2013 and 2014) was also assessed but it was not significant too. Carcass classification according to SEUROP system was in case of charolais crossbreds most often in class R (75 %), while piemontese crossbreds were mostly classified into class R (54. 55 %) and U (45. 45 %) in 2013. In 2014, carcass of charolais crossbreds was most often in class U (45. 45 %) and E (36. 36 %), carcass of piemontese in class E (30 %), U (40 %) and R (30 %). Fatness classification within two years of observation was, in all cases, into class 1. Findings did not show that under the certain conditions there were no differences between charolais and piemontese crossbreds. The difference in evaluated traits between years 2013 and 2014 within those breeds was also not confirmed which points out constancy of husbandry condition. The important thing for farmer is carcass classification according to SEUROP system and results show that piemontese crossbred carcasses are favourably classified...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the trial is to compare fattening performance, slaughter results and meat quality of bulls from international cattle breeds with local Hungarian <b>breeds</b> <b>fattened</b> under the same conditions. Altogether 62 growing bulls – Angus, Charolais, Holstein, Hungarian Grey, Hungarian Simmental, Charolais × Hungarian Grey – were fattened in small groups. The daily gain varied from 897 (Hungarian Grey) to 1 240 g/day (Angus). In general, the lower gain value {{is caused by the}} semi-intensive fattening system with low concentrate supplementation. The slaughter weight showed a similar tendency as final weight, {{there was a significant difference}} between Angus and Hungarian Grey. The killing out of Charolais (59. 50 %), Angus (56. 80 %) and Hungarian Simmental (57. 84 %) was significantly higher than Hungarian Grey (55. 13 %) and Holstein (55. 03 %). Due to Charolais crossing the dressing percentage of Hungarian Grey was developed by about 1. 5 %. The EU conformation scores of Charolais (9. 50) and Hungarian Simmental (9. 33) and the fatness scores of Angus (8. 33) and Charolais × Hungarian Grey (7. 33) were significantly higher than that of the other genotypes. The tissue composition of dissected carcass as well as ribs joint composition determined by X-ray computerised tomography method showed the lean meat of Hungarian Simmental and bone proportions of Holstein to be the highest, whilst Angus had the highest fat content. Charolais und Hungarian Simmental had significant higher longissimus muscle area in ribs joint compared to Angus, Holstein and Charolais × Hungarian Grey. Angus and Hungarian Grey had the highest intramuscular fat level of the three examined muscles...|$|R
