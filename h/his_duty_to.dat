5|$|Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent: Clark Kent's {{adoptive father}} in Smallville during his youth. He is a farmer who teaches Clark skills {{that will help}} him in the future. He later suffers a fatal heart attack that changes Clark's outlook on <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, {{on the eve}} of his {{departure}} to tour as a guest conductor through Western Europe, Tchaikovsky stopped in Saint Petersburg and consulted with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov on a detailed program of Russian music that he might lead in Paris. Though this opportunity did not arise, it shows his openness to promoting works by the Belyayev circle as <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> promote Russian music.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> send an apology to the Pope {{and it is}} inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} towards his subjects {{and believed that}} it was <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unnecessary}} to add, {{that it was}} instantly afforded. He recovered; and, when discharged from the hospital, signified his desired {{to return to his}} corps to combat us again: exhibiting thus, through the whole, a strong sense of the value of generosity and courtesy in warfare, and also of <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> his country,– separating completely in his own mind private and national feelings from each other,– and his frank confidence in the individuals of our nation, from the duty he owed his own, to fight against us collectively.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 2004 due {{to health}} {{problems}} (he suffered from tuberculosis) he resigned from {{active participation in}} editing Gazeta Wyborcza and passed <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> editorial colleague Helena Łuczywo.|$|R

50|$|Biggar {{suffered}} a heart failure {{in the spring of}} 1944 and was forced to reduce his responsibilities. With his health deteriorating, Biggar relinquished <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> General Andrew McNaughton in 1945.|$|R
5|$|King {{decided to}} appoint two {{additional}} ministers, one {{in charge of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, decided it was <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> fight World War II as a political leader in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{declined}} the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> serve {{music in the}} United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals {{throughout the country and}} also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, ESPA {{received}} press attention when, {{approaching the}} end of Ross D. Levi's second year as executive director, it assigned <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> deputy Lynn Faria pending a long-term replacement.|$|R
50|$|The court {{felt that}} the action {{constituted}} contempt of court in that Sheriff Shipp, fully knowledgeable of the court's ruling, chose <b>to</b> ignore <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect a prisoner in his care.|$|R
50|$|In the {{investigations}} {{by both the}} Investigative Commission of 1945 and the Military Investigative Commission of 1946 Eriksen was confirmed to have carried out <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> the full during the German invasion.|$|R
5|$|As soon as Kantakouzenos left Constantinople in July 1341 to {{campaign}} against the Empire's enemies who were assaulting it, Apokaukos made his first moves. Although as commander of the fleet it was <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> guard the Dardanelles against any attempt by Turks to cross into Europe, he deliberately allowed this to happen in order to cause disruption in Thrace. Apokaukos tried to kidnap the young John V, but failed {{and was forced to}} flee to his house at Epibatai. However, when Kantakouzenos returned victorious to the capital, instead of depriving Apokaukos of his offices, and against the counsel of his friends, he pardoned his protégé. Apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to Kantakouzenos, who allowed him to resume his offices and return to Constantinople, while Kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> take Covent Garden on.|$|E
5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting {{for days on end}} and dunking himself into a river to refresh his body between evening and morning prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan considers it <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to people from different ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E
50|$|After President John Dramani Mahama {{was sworn}} in January 2013, Mr Newman handed over <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> Prosper Douglas Bani as Chief of Staff. He was {{appointed}} {{a member of the}} Council of State.|$|R
50|$|Mr Holdsworth {{became the}} {{managing}} director of the textile company after a buyout. But then the parent became dissatisfied and purported <b>to</b> move <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> a subsidiary. He sued for breach of contract.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew that}} he was wicked in not staying in the library and {{continuing}} <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> the party. He had to crowd into a minute all his agonizing and be back at once.|$|R
5|$|In June 1853 Bennett {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} as a soloist with orchestra {{in his own}} Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a new organization, the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard (Davison's wife) in Bennett's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected {{to take over the}} conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's Emperor Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E
5000|$|Miller was the {{starting}} quarterback at Kansas State University in 1995. [...] He took over quarterback duties at Kansas State from Chad May before surrendering <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> Brian Kavanagh when his college career was complete.|$|R
60|$|Brigade-Surgeon-Lieut.-Colonel F.A. Smyth {{was most}} zealous, and {{performed}} <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> my satisfaction. He volunteered <b>to</b> perform the <b>duties</b> of Provost Marshal, {{and did so}} {{for a short time}} during the illness of Lieutenant H.E. Cotterill.|$|R
50|$|Falkland Palace in Falkland, Fife, Scotland, is a royal {{palace of}} the Scottish Kings. Today {{it is under}} the {{stewardship}} of the Marquess of Bute, who delegates most of <b>his</b> <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> The National Trust for Scotland.|$|R
5|$|More {{disturbing}} to Lord Howe were {{the actions of}} HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and allowing her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of the}} line.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was finally}} able to bring Symeon before the Synod on charges of honoring as a saint someone who Stephen {{believed}} was far from saintly. At first, Patriarch Sergius II of Constantinople supported Symeon, {{going so far as to}} send candles and perfume in support of the veneration of Symeon the Studite at St. Mammas. Stephen attacked the Studite as unholy and sinful, and was eventually able to convince others that Symeon's homage was improper by convincing them that the Studite held some unorthodox beliefs. As a compromise, Stephen suggested that the annual festival honoring the elder Symeon be held as a private observance within the monastery. Symeon the New Theologian refused to compromise, declaring that it was <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> honor the church fathers and the saints, and in January 1009 was condemned to go into exile. Stephen also convinced the Patriarch to order all icons of Symeon the Studite removed from St. Mammas, with many of them destroyed or covered over with soot.|$|E
5|$|The X-Files {{centers on}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully was {{initially}} assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Scully returns from Africa to discover Mulder in a coma induced by exposure to shards from an alien spaceship wreck. After Mulder disappears from the hospital, Scully joins former government employee Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) and her boss Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to search for him. Meanwhile, in a dream, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) offers Mulder a new life and a fresh start. After conferring with a vision of Scully, Mulder awakens from his coma and realizes <b>his</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> prevent alien colonization.|$|E
