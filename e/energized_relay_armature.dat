25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later <b>energized</b> <b>relays</b> in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area.

5000|$|Each mine {{contained}} a {{dry cell battery}} with an electrical detonating circuit which could be initiated by any one of five parallel fuzes. Four of the fuzes were conventional horns in the buoyant upper hemisphere of the mine. Each horn {{contained a}} glass ampule of electrolyte which would connect an open circuit if an ampule was broken by bending the soft metal horn. [...] The novel fifth fuze was a copper wire antenna with a float to extend it above the mine. A ship's steel hull touching the copper antenna would form a battery, and seawater acted as an electrolyte completing a circuit with an insulated copper plate on the mine surface to actuate a detonating relay within the mine. [...] The <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> was initially set to complete the detonating circuit at 25 to 40 millivolts. The Bureau of Ordnance subsequently increased sensitivity to 10 to 25 millivolts, but this was later readjusted {{on the basis of}} field experience. [...] Each mine had five separate spring-loaded safety switches in the detonating circuit held open by salt pellets which took about 20 minutes to dissolve in sea water after the mine was dropped overboard from the minelayer. [...] Battery life for the detonating circuit was estimated at greater than two years.|$|R
50|$|Three to {{five percent}} of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones {{detected}} premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from 250 ft on the first minelaying excursion to 300 ft on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine mooring cable attachment points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions.|$|R

The other output is fed through an isolation transformer, a full wave rectifier, {{to a pair of}} unijunctional transistor circuits for producing pulses when the voltage exceeds or drops below a predetermined level.

50|$|When the {{ignition}} is first turned on, the ECU <b>energizes</b> a <b>relay</b> {{that runs the}} fuel pump {{for a short time}} to pressurize the fuel rail.

For the next several seconds, the injector pulse width is wider than normal to provide sufficient fuel for starting. Idle control is performed by adjusting a stepper-motor-driven bypass valve in the intake plenum. When {{the ignition}} is switched off, the ECU winds the bypass valve fully open to provide enough air the next time the engine is started.|$|R

5000|$|Common {{difficulties}} with the sweeping procedure involved mine cables becoming {{entangled in the}} kites attached to the sweeping wires. Sweeping gear was often lost if the mine detonated and cut the sweeping cables. Approximately {{one third of the}} ships were damaged by exploding mines. Two men were killed in separate incidents while attempting to haul mines aboard to clear fouled sweeping kites. It had been assumed the Mk 6 mine hydrostatic safety devices would minimize the risks of this procedure, but sweeping gear losses increased after unreliability of these safety devices was recognized. Countermining sequences initiated by destruction of a swept mine causing detonation of an undetected mine closer to one of the minesweepers were another source of damage. Some of this countermining was attributed to acceleration of the antenna fuze <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> or seawater leaking into damaged mines rather than sympathetic detonation of explosives. The minesweepers were sometimes able to continue sweeping, but the trawlers were less durable. Seven men drowned when the Richard Bulkeley was sunk by a mine detonation on 12 July. Strauss discontinued use of the trawlers for minesweeping, but retained six for transporting replacement sweeping gear to minesweepers when wires were destroyed by exploding mines. The remaining 13 trawlers were returned to the Admiralty. Most damaged ships were repaired, but SC-38 was declared a total loss. Three more men of the minesweeping force were killed in individual accidents involving sweeping gear before Strauss declared the barrage cleared on 30 September 1919. [...] The minesweepers found only about 25 to 30 percent of the mines laid a year earlier; but it was assumed the others had either broken free, sunk to the bottom, or been destroyed by premature explosions. Strauss was recognized as a Knight Commander of St Michael and St George for his efforts; but doubts about effectiveness of the minesweeping effort persisted into the 21st century.|$|R

The {{scientific}} paper {{focuses on}} {{development of a}} method for mechanical parameters control of the neutral relay of rail automatics by current analyzing in the coil and the relay contacts at switching based on wavelet transform. Methodology. The methodology was based on current analysis of the relay coil and contacts currents under its switching and analysis obtained results by using wavelet transform. Findings. The time dependences of the current in coil and in contacts under switching {{on and off for}} the operable relays and relays with certain defects have been measured at different voltages applied to coil (10, 12 и 14 V). When voltage applied to coil was increased the rate of coil current increased, but time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly. The current value maximum at which the <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> begun to move for the operable relays was depended on applied voltage slightly. For the time interval, at which armature was putted to the relay core fully, time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly also. The maximum current value at which the armature starts to move to the relay serviceable little dependent on the applied voltage. For site based in which the anchor is completely dragged constant current rise time is also a little dependent on the applied voltage. Similar results were obtained for the current reduction time constant with turning off the voltage and current confinement. The current pick-up and the current release of the armature increases for the relay with the load anchor is proportional to the weight of cargo, {{as well as for the}} relay contact with the rear, bent down, while the flexural rear contact up these currents have smaller values.

50|$|A simple {{electromagnetic}} relay {{consists of a}} coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the <b>relay</b> pictured).

The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{operation}} of technologies of governance in policy work, within and across borders. The good governance agenda in international development offers a germane case in which to investigate what happens in contemporary policy action. Mixing aspirations for larger freedom with detailed technical packages of control, what is the policy work actually delivering? The idea of good governance appeared to offer new solutions to many theoretical, practical and ethical issues, at a point after the Cold War, when the international arena {{was in need of}} a new story. As such, the notion has drawn interest and resources from across political, academic and civil society divides since 1989, generating an, apparently broad-based, international consensus that good governance and sustainable development are interrelated. However, many policy models still in use in the development arena, and particularly those underlying the good governance discourse, assume a linear model of action and history, and a technology-led theory of authority and change. This framing still permeates many public scripts that circulate in and across international gatherings, outlining failures of the past, visions for the future and current action plans for reform. It screens out contrary empirical evidence, treating policy instruments as value neutral, deterministic or both. In effect, these public transcripts gloss over controversies about how to implement better governance in diverse local contexts. What then are these technological packages doing? I used a multi-level, multi-site research strategy based on situational analysis to probe policy action in the international development ‘arena’. Mozambique, Australia and Sweden feature as sites of inquiry into how the theory/methods packages ascribed to good governance have been, and are being, translated into policy work. I applied an interactive approach to my analysis, viewing policy as a process of social tinkering and technologies of governance as fluid co-actors in the assemblage of talk and action categorised as ‘policy work’. I argue that regulatory tools, such as policy framings, cannot be assumed to work as expected. Individual or group interaction with such artefacts may give rise to moments of creativity that breed unexpected consequences, such as reverse effects or new ideas. Such changes disrupt social relations, often interrupting the exercise of authority and unleashing conflict. My findings highlight the negotiated and political quality of boundaries among defined actors, actions and representations. At the international level, the good governance agenda has been both strongly prescriptive, especially about how to do policy within borders, and descriptive, claiming superior normative performance in states and organisations categorised as donors. This has had repercussions for OECD donors as well as international development agencies. Firstly and unsurprisingly, ‘good’, is open to flexible interpretation. Then ‘governance’, developing as a fuzzy concept, questions where decision-making is located and who is involved. Thirdly, by positioning ‘good governance’ as a pre-condition for development, standards have emerged for benchmarking, not only development partners but also OECD donors. Questions arise in many arenas as to the competence of the latter states, with, I argue, mutual accountability emerging as a new agenda. At locality level in Mozambique, such technologies of governance as membership categorisation, strategic pre-positioning and intertextuality, are also visible in the process of establishing or re-instating traditional leaders for local development plans. I found that the perspective developed in this study on policy work underlines the position that power {{is by no means a}} free ‘good’ to be exercised in a linear fashion by strategically sited authorities. Many people, positioned differentially within areas of policy activity, interact with the array of technologies used to solve and create development problems. The idea of creative moments recognizes that people <b>energize</b> tools, which <b>relay</b> particular logics and past meanings, but also stresses that tool use is not context-free and can occasionally inspire users to new ideas and, perhaps, more ethically reflective ways of learning and doing. Good governance is better understood as a changing state of art rather than a fixed art of state...|$|R
