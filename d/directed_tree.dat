5000|$|Revisions {{occur in}} {{sequence}} over time, {{and thus can}} be arranged in order, either by revision number or timestamp. Revisions are based on past revisions, though {{it is possible to}} largely or completely replace an earlier revision, such as [...] "delete all existing text, insert new text". In the simplest case, with no branching or undoing, each revision is based on its immediate predecessor alone, and they form a simple line, with a single latest version, the [...] "HEAD" [...] revision or tip. In graph theory terms, drawing each revision as a point and each [...] "derived revision" [...] relationship as an arrow (conventionally pointing from older to newer, {{in the same direction as}} time), this is a linear graph. If there is branching, so multiple future revisions are based on a past revision, or undoing, so a revision can depend on a revision older than its immediate predecessor, then the resulting graph is instead a <b>directed</b> <b>tree</b> (each node can have more than one child), and has multiple tips, corresponding to the revisions without children ("latest revision on each branch"). In principle the resulting tree need not have a preferred tip ("main" [...] latest revision) - just various different revisions - but in practice one tip is generally identified as HEAD. When a new revision is based on HEAD, it is either identified as the new HEAD, or considered a new branch. The list of revisions from the start to HEAD (in graph theory terms, the unique path in the tree, which forms a linear graph as before) is the trunk or mainline. Conversely, when a revision can be based on more than one previous revision (when a node can have more than one parent), the resulting process is called a merge, and is one of the most complex aspects of revision control. This most often occurs when changes occur in multiple branches (most often two, but more are possible), which are then merged into a single branch incorporating both changes. If these changes overlap, it may be difficult or impossible to merge, and require manual intervention or rewriting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Store-and-forward packet routing {{belongs to}} the most fundamen-tal tasks in network optimization. Limited {{bandwith}} requires that some pack-ets cannot move to their destination directly but need to wait in intermediate nodes on their path or take detours. It is desirable to find schedules that en-sure fast delivery of the packets, in particular for time critial applications. In this paper we investigate the packet routing problem theoretically. We prove that the problem cannot be approximated with a factor of 6 / 5 − for all > 0 unless P = NP. We show that restricting the graph topology to planar graphs or even <b>directed</b> <b>trees</b> still does not allow a PTAS. We present three individual algorithms for packet routing on trees: For undirected trees we give a factor 2 approximation. For <b>directed</b> <b>trees</b> we show that the path coloring problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time. Based on this, we show how to construct a schedule with length C + D − 1 where C and D denote the trivial lower bounds congestion and dilation. If the lengths of the paths of the packets are pairwise different, we can compute a schedule of length D on <b>directed</b> <b>trees</b> which is optimal. For all cases we show that our analysis is tight. Finally, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the packet routing problem with an absolute error of k for any k ≥ 0. 1...|$|R
