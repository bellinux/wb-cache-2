5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an epidermal <b>invagination</b> known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another <b>invagination</b> of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Using {{digestion}} {{with specific}} enzymes, the chemical nature has been resolved of {{components of the}} nuclear <b>invaginations</b> formed in post-meiotic microspores of Pinus banksiana (Lamb.). The content of the <b>invaginations</b> is formed almost entirely of RNA, while the main bulk of the granular material investing the narrow part of the <b>invaginations</b> is also RNA. The membranes composing the narrow portion of the <b>invaginations</b> are themselves sensitive to RNase. These data are considered as supporting further {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>invaginations</b> are involved in the passage and organisation of information-carrying macromolecules...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of plasmalemma <b>invaginations</b> in plasmodial veins of Physarum polycephalum were made under different conditions of nutrition. Pronounced differences were observed {{dependent on the}} nutritional content of the substrate. There was a decided {{increase in the number}} of plasmalemma <b>invaginations</b> in plasmodial veins grown on substrates containing absorbable food substances compared to veins migrating on non-nutrient substrates. This observation supports the proposition that the nutritional content, rather than the physical properties, of the substrate is the decisive factor for the formation of plasmalemma <b>invaginations.</b> The <b>invaginations</b> are believed to be concerned with the uptake of non-particu-late food substances...|$|R
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an <b>invagination</b> of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an <b>invagination</b> in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
25|$|The embryo {{undergoes}} well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation {{and early}} development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral <b>invagination</b> of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior <b>invagination</b> of endoderm (gut), {{as well as}} extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.|$|E

5000|$|Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{is one of}} {{the most}} pivotal organisms in the study of {{bacterial}} photosynthesis. It requires no unusual conditions for growth and is incredibly efficient. The regulation of its photosynthetic machinery is of great interest to researchers, as R. sphaeroides has an intricate system for sensing O2 tensions. [...] Also, when exposed to a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen, R. sphaeroides develops <b>invaginations</b> in its cellular membrane. The photosynthetic apparatus is housed in these <b>invaginations.</b> These <b>invaginations</b> are also known as chromatophores.|$|R
40|$|Caveolae are plasma {{membrane}} <b>invaginations,</b> {{which have been}} implicated in endothelial transcytosis, endocytosis, potocytosis, and signal transduction. In addition to their well-defined morphology, caveolae are characterized {{by the presence of}} an integral membrane protein termed VIP 21 -caveolin. We have recently observed that lymphocytes have no detectable VIP 21 -caveolin and lack {{plasma membrane}} <b>invaginations</b> resembling caveolae. Here we transiently express VIP 21 -caveolin in a lymphocyte cell line using the Semliki Forest virus expression system and show de novo formation of plasma membrane <b>invaginations</b> containing VIP 21 -caveolin. These <b>invaginations</b> appear homogeneous in size and morphologically indistinguishable from caveolae of nonlymphoid cells, Moreover, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Thy 1, patched by antibodies, redistributes to the newly formed caveolae, Our results show that VIP 21 -caveolin is a key structural component required for caveolar biogenesis...|$|R

25|$|During early development, the {{sea urchin}} embryo {{undergoes}} 10 cycles of cell division, {{resulting in a}} single epithelial layer enveloping a blastocoel. The embryo must then begin gastrulation, a multipart process which involves the dramatic rearrangement and <b>invagination</b> of cells to produce the three germ layers.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{cells can}} exhibit highly complex nuclear organization. Through dye-labeling {{experiments}} in untransformed onion epidermal and tobacco culture cells {{and through the}} expression of green fluorescent protein targeted to either the nucleus or the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope in these cells, we have visualized deep grooves and <b>invaginations</b> into the large nuclei of these cells. In onion, these structures, which are similar to <b>invaginations</b> seen in some animal cells, form tubular or planelike infoldings of the nuclear envelope. Both grooves and <b>invaginations</b> are stable structures, and both have cytoplasmic cores containing actin bundles that can support cytoplasmic streaming. In dividing tobacco cells, <b>invaginations</b> seem to form during cell division, possibly from strands of the endoplasmic reticulum trapped in the reforming nucleus. The substantial increase in nuclear surface area resulting from these grooves and <b>invaginations,</b> their apparent preference for association with nucleoli, and the presence in them of actin bundles that support vesicle motility suggest that the structures might function both in mRNA export from the nucleus and in protein import from the cytoplasm to the nucleus...|$|R

40|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} (NE) surrounds the nucleus and separates {{it from the}} cytoplasm. The NE is not a passive structural component, but rather contributes to various cellular processes such as genome organization, transcription, signaling, and stress responses. Although the NE is mostly a smooth surface, it also forms <b>invaginations</b> that can reach deep into the nucleoplasm and may even traverse the nucleus completely. Cancer cells are generally characterized by irregularities and <b>invaginations</b> of the NE that are of diagnostic and prognostic significance. In the current chapter, we describe the link between nuclear <b>invaginations</b> and irregularities with cancer and explore possible mechanistic roles they might have in tumorigenesis...|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Wolffian ducts a second pair of ducts is developed; these are the Müllerian ducts. Each arises on the lateral aspect of the corresponding Wolffian duct as a tubular <b>invagination</b> of the cells lining the abdominal cavity. The orifice of the <b>invagination</b> remains open, and undergoes enlargement and modification to form the abdominal ostium of the fallopian tube. The ducts pass backward lateral to the Wolffian ducts, but toward the posterior end of the embryo they cross to the medial side of these ducts, and thus come to lie side by side between and behind the latter—the four ducts forming what is termed the common genital cord, to distinguish it from the genital cords of the germinal epithelium seen later in this article. The Müllerian ducts end in an epithelial elevation, the Müllerian eminence, on the ventral part of the cloaca between the orifices of the Wolffian ducts. At a later stage the eminence opens in the middle, connecting the Müllerian ducts with the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|Deuterostomes {{differ from}} protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a {{complete}} digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first {{opening of the}} gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill {{in the interior of}} the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through <b>invagination</b> of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Proneural gene {{expression}} in the neuroectodermal cells that constitutes the proneural clusters turns them competent to delaminate as neuroblasts. Although neuroblasts are the precursors of Drosophila’s central nervous system (CNS), the proneural {{gene expression}} are also involved in control specification and morphogenesis of stomatogastric nerve cell precursors. These genes are expressed and required during all phases of the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) development to regulate the number, pattern and structural characteristics of the SNS subpopulations. The proper balance between proneural and neurogenic gene {{expression in the}} SNS placodes {{is involved in the}} control of a complex sequence of morphogenetic movements (delamination, <b>invagination</b> and dissociation) by which these placodes give rise to the different SNS subpopulations.|$|E

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} cell granule secretory pathway {{is essential for}} immune defence. How the pore-forming protein perforin (PFN) facilitates the cytosolic delivery of granule-associated proteases (granzymes) remains enigmatic. Here we show that PFN is able to induce <b>invaginations</b> and formation of complete internal vesicles in giant unilamellar vesicles. Formation of internal vesicles depends on native PFN and calcium and antibody labeling shows the localization of PFN at the <b>invaginations.</b> This vesiculation is recapitulated in large unilamellar vesicles {{and in this case}} PFN oligomers can be seen associated with the necks of the <b>invaginations.</b> Capacitance measurements show PFN is able to increase a planar lipid membrane surface area in the absence of pore formation, in agreement with the ability to induce <b>invaginations.</b> Finally, addition of PFN to Jurkat cells causes the formation of internal vesicles prior to pore formation. PFN is capable of triggering an endocytosis-like event in addition to pore formation, suggesting a new paradigm for its role in delivering apoptosis-inducing granzymes into target cells...|$|R

25|$|According to Burou, the {{operation}} {{began with an}} incision from the anal area through the scrotal raphe. After dissecting of the bulbus urethrae and both corpora cavernosa, the rectum and the prostate were separated by cutting all the ligaments between the bulb and the rectum. Burou {{made a point of}} barring, but not damaging, the posterior aspect of the prostate so that the penile skin flap after <b>invagination</b> would immediately overlie this aspect, which he felt optimized the possibility of postoperative orgasm. The separation was extended digitally and was considered complete as soon as two fingers or a vaginal retractor could be admitted easily. Burou considered this first part of {{the operation}} to be the most important, but most risky, and stressed the importance of repeated intrarectal inspection to determine that there was no lesion to the rectal wall.|$|E
2500|$|The shells develop {{from the}} {{ectoderm}} as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralised. [...] In Sepia, {{which has an}} internal shell, the ectoderm forms an <b>invagination</b> whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited.|$|E

40|$|Immunofluorescent {{staining}} of bovine and avian cardiac tissue with affinity-purified antibody to chicken gizzard vinculin reveals two new {{sites of}} vinculin reactivity. First, vinculin is organized at the sarcolemma in a striking array of rib-like bands, or costameres. The costameres encircle the cardiac muscle cell {{perpendicular to the}} long axis of the fiber and overlie the I bands of the immediately subjacent sarcomeres. The second new site of vinculin reactivity is found in bovine cardiocytes at tubular <b>invaginations</b> of the plasma membrane. The frequency and location of these <b>invaginations</b> correspond to the known frequency and distribution of the transverse tubular system in bovine atrial, ventricular, and Purkinje fibers. We do not detect tubular <b>invaginations</b> that stain with antivinculin in avian cardiocytes and, in fact, a transverse tubular system has not been found in avian cardiac fibers. Apparent lateral Z-line attachments to the sarcolemma and its <b>invaginations</b> have been observed in cardiac muscle by electron microscopy in the same regions where we find vinculin. On {{the basis of these}} previous ultrastructural findings and our published evidence for a physical connection between costameres and the underlying myofibrils in skeletal muscle, we interpret the immunofluorescence data of this study to mean that, in cardiac muscle, vinculin is a component of an extensive system of lateral attachment of myofibrils to the plasma membrane and its <b>invaginations...</b>|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Caveolae are specialized lipid microdomains, forming small <b>invaginations</b> in {{the plasma}} membrane, {{known to be}} implicated in multiple functions including lipid storage, cell signaling and endocytosis.

2500|$|... eNOS {{expression}} and activity {{are controlled by}} multiple interconnected mechanisms of regulation present at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. Binding of transcription factors such as Sp1, Sp3, Ets-1, Elf-1, and YY1 to the NOS3 promoter and DNA methylation represents an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Posttranscriptionally, eNOS is regulated by modifications of the primary transcript, mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and nucleocytoplasmatic transport. Posttranslational modifications of eNOS include fatty acid acylation, protein-protein interactions, substrate, and co-factor availability, and degree of phosphorylation. Importantly, eNOS is attached by myristoylation and palmitoylation to caveolae, a pocket-like <b>invagination</b> on the membrane rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. With the binding of eNOS to caveolae, the enzyme is inactivated due to the strong and direct interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1. The binding of calcium-activated calmodulin to eNOS displaces caveolin-1 and activates eNOS. Moreover, eNOS activation is dynamically regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites at tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues.|$|E
2500|$|Nautiluses are {{the only}} extant {{cephalopods}} with a true external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in cuttlefish (Sepia spp.), for example, an <b>invagination</b> of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell (cuttlebone) that is internal in the adult. [...] The {{same is true of}} the chitinous gladius of squid and octopuses. Cirrate octopods have arch-shaped cartilaginous fin supports, which are sometimes referred to as a [...] "shell vestige" [...] or [...] "gladius". The Incirrina have either a pair of rod-shaped stylets or no vestige of an internal shell, and some squid also lack a gladius. [...] Interestingly, the shelled coleoids do not form a clade or even a paraphyletic group. [...] The Spirula shell begins as an organic structure, and is then very rapidly mineralized. [...] Shells that are [...] "lost" [...] may be lost by resorption of the calcium carbonate component.|$|E
2500|$|Several major {{transitions}} in shell pattern and morphology {{can be observed}} during the life of Haliotis asinina. The species has a pelagobenthic life cycle that includes a minimal period of three to four days in the plankton. Biomineralisation begins shortly after hatching, with the fabrication of the larval shell (protoconch) over about a 10-hour period. The initial differentiation of biomineralising cells is likely to include a localised thickening of the dorsal ectoderm followed by an <b>invagination</b> of cells to form the shell gland. The shell gland then evaginates to form the shell field which expands through mitotic divisions to direct the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via the secretion of organic molecules. In this way the larval shell (protoconch) is formed. The construction of the haliotid protoconch is complete following torsion. These structures allow the veliger larva to completely retract into a protective environment and rapidly {{fall out of the}} water column.: ...|$|E
