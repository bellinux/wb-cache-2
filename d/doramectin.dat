Eight different avermectins were isolated in four pairs of homologue compounds, with a major (a-component) and minor (b-component) component usually in ratios of 80:20 to 90:10.

50|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of broad-spectrum {{anthelmintics}} in the 1960’s, treatment of worm infections in pigs has become increasingly reliant on mass-treatment with anthelmintic drugs. When selecting a drug for the control of helminth infections, several things need to be taken into account. Namely, 1) the margin of safety of the used compound, 2) the efficacy of compound against the different stages of the parasite, 3) the spectrum of activity, 4) the mode of administration and last but not least, 5) the cost of the drug. All of the modern anthelmintics are found to be very safe. Treatments with doses exceeding several times the recommended dose could not show any clinical effect in pigs. For the effective control of helminth infections on a pig farm it is advantageous to select an anthelminticum that kills the larval stages and has a broad spectrum of activity. The drugs pyrantel, fenbendazole, flubendazole and levamisole also have shown activity against migrating stages of A. suum (Kennedy et al., 1987; Oakley, 1974; Stewart et al., 1984; Thienpont et al., 1978). Piperazine and pyrantel have restricted activity against the other common porcine nematode infections (Trichuris suis & Oesophagostomum spp.) (Rochette, 1985) and are therefore not the drugs of choice when co-infections with these parasites are present on a farm. Anthelmintics of the macrocyclic lactone family (e.g. ivermectin, <b>doramectin)</b> have a significantly longer residual effect in comparison with the other anthelmintics. Lichtensteiger et al., (1999) reported that the anthelmintic activity of ivermectin persisted for less than 7 days and over 7, but less than 14 days for <b>doramectin.</b> Moreover, these compounds are also highly efficient against ectoparasites like mange mites (Sarcoptes scabiei var suis) and hog lice (Haematopinus suis) (Lee et al., 1980; Lichtensteiger et al., 1999; Logan et al., 1996; Stewart et al., 1981b; Yazwinski et al., 1997).Anthelmintics are available in a variety of formulations. Administration of the drug in either water or feed is the easiest and most economical way, but has the disadvantage of variable dosages being delivered when numbers of pigs are being treated in groups from a single source of medication. Delivery by injection on the other hand, is more accurate in dosage but is time- and labour intensive, which adds to the overall cost of treatment. Injectable anthelmintics have a significantly longer withdrawal period (a minimum of 28 days for <b>doramectin)</b> in comparison with in-feed formulations and are usually conserved for the treatment of the breeding stock (Conder and Baker, 2002). The overall cost of anthelmintic treatment will vary, depending on the choice of anthelmintic, number of treatments, and weight of the animals being treated. In general, for the choice of anthelmintic, pig farmers will base themselves on information received from their veterinarians or feed companies and more importantly, on their previous experiences with a selected anthelmintic (Theodoropoulos et al., 2001). To date, no studies have reported anthelminticum resistance in A. suum in pigs. Whether anthelmintic resistance would be easily induced in A. suum is unknown. However, the development of anthelmintic resistance in Oesophagostomum spp. and in the closely related horse parasite, Parascaris equorum (Boersema et al., 2002; Laugier et al., 2012; Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999; Nareaho et al., 2011) suggests that continued malpractice in this area might eventually lead to anthelmintic resistance in A. suum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{anthelmintic}} {{efficiency of}} <b>doramectin,</b> fenbendazole, and nitroxynil, used individually or in combination, {{was determined by}} the Fecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) test and cultivation of larvae of anthelminthic-treated sheep grouped as follows: G 1 (<b>doramectin),</b> G 2 (fenbendazole), G 3 (nitroxynil), G 4 (<b>doramectin</b> + fenbendazole), G 5 (<b>doramectin</b> + nitroxynil), G 6 (fenbendazole + nitroxynil), G 7 (<b>doramectin</b> + nitroxynil + fenbendazole), G 8 (untreated). In addition to individually used <b>doramectin</b> and fenbendazole, the helminths were also resistant to the combination of <b>doramectin</b> + fenbendazole; nitroxynil + fenbendazole; and <b>doramectin</b> + nitroxynil + fenbendazole, with their FECR rates ranging from 62 - 83 %. The helminths showed possible nitroxynil-resistance, but had low resistance when the drug was administered in combination with <b>doramectin.</b> The evaluation of individual helminth species revealed that fenbendazole was fully effective against Cooperia; <b>doramectin</b> (G 1), moderately effective against Haemonchus and insufficiently active againstCooperia; nitroxynil, effective againstHaemonchus and insufficiently active againstCooperia. It was concluded from the results that herd nematodes are resistant to <b>doramectin,</b> fenbendazole, and nitroxynil, and that the combined use of the drugs not only fails to significantly improve the anthelmintic efficiency against Haemonchus andCooperia, but is also cost-ineffective...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSelf-licking {{behaviour}} in cattle {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} determinant of the kinetic disposition of topically-administered ivermectin. In the present study, we document the occurrence and extent of transfer between cattle of three topically-administered endectocides, as a consequence of allo-licking. Four groups of two Holstein cows each received one pour-on formulation of <b>doramectin,</b> ivermectin, or moxidectin, or no treatment. The cows were then kept together in a paddock. Systemic exposure to each topically-administered endectocide was observed in at least five of six non-treated cattle. Plasma and faecal drug concentration profiles in non-treated animals were highly variable between animals and within an animal, and sometimes attained those observed in treated animals. Drug exchanges were quantified by measuring plasma and faecal clearances after simultaneous i. v. administration of the three drugs as a cocktail. Plasma clearances were 185 +/- 43, 347 +/- 77 and 636 +/- 130 ml/kg/day, faecal clearances representing 75 +/- 26, 28 +/- 13, and 39 +/- 30 % of the plasma clearance for <b>doramectin,</b> ivermectin and moxidectin, respectively. The amount of drug ingested by non-treated cattle attained 1. 3 - 21. 3 % (<b>doramectin),</b> 1. 3 - 16. 1 % (ivermectin), 2. 4 - 10. 6 % (moxidectin) of a pour-on dose (500 microg/kg). The total amount of drug ingested by all non-treated cattle represented 29 % (<b>doramectin),</b> 19 % (ivermectin), and 8. 6 % (moxidectin) of the total amount of each drug poured on the backs of treated animals. The cumulative amounts of endectocide ingested by each non-treated cow ranged from 1. 3 to 27. 4 % of a pour-on dose.
