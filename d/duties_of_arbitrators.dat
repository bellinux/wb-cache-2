50|$|Dowling, son of Vincent George Dowling, was {{probably}} born in London. He {{was called to}} {{the bar at the}} Middle Temple, 24 November 1848. He became editor of Bell's Life in London on the illness of his father in 1851. He was remarkable for his urbanity, and for the fair manner in which he discharged the <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator</b> and umpire in numerous cases of disputes connected with the prize-ring. He had the control of the arrangements of the international fight between Thomas Sayers and John C.

40|$|International {{arbitration}} {{in common}} revered {{as important to}} world trade. This has been made possible through a growing realization of international specifity. Since the 90 ’s some experts have remarked the confrontational climate of many international arbitrations. The international business environment has made international arbitration a more formalized and legalized dispute resolution process. Arbitration in general depends on the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrators.</b> The essential <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> an <b>arbitrator</b> is to facilitate dialogue between the parties, {{making it possible to}} reach an agreement by both individualising litigious sides and arriving at a fair solution. Arbitrators should perform their duties in accordance with a reasonable standard of conduct and competence. For this reason arbitrators shall be and shall remain free from bias.

The {{article focuses}} {{on the issue of}} the {{international}} arbitral tribunals’ authority to disregard supposedly applicable statutory provisions of a given national law, which it deems to be non-compliant with relevant constitutional norms from the perspective of the Polish constitutional and arbitration law. Due to the fact that, in recent years, the present issue attracted a significant attention from the international academia, the analysis of the article begins with the report of various positions adopted by some of the leading international scholars on the matter in question. This initial study provides a firm basis for further exploration of this issue in light of the Polish law, which is preceded by a brief summary of the fundamental constitutional principles and notions underpinning the contemporary Polish legal order. Such critical analysis drives the author to a conclusion that there are no sufficiently persuasive arguments which would justify barring international arbitrators from applying the Polish substantive law in its entirety, including denying application of provisions violating the Constitution, which will supersede other normative acts. Conversely, the exercise of such arbitral review amounts to a basic <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> (integral part <b>of</b> their mandate to resolve a dispute in accordance with the Polish law as the applicable substantive law of a dispute) rather than their discretionary authority...|$|R

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} current state of the debate on the {{relations}} between competition law and arbitration. It addresses the two central issues of the nature of the review by courts of awards involving competition law and <b>of</b> the <b>duties</b> and powers <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> with regard to the application of competition law. The author analyzes the standard of review of awards involving competition law at the setting aside and enforcement stage and shows that a standard which is compatible with the general principle of minimal review of awards on the merits does not hinder effective anti-trust enforcement. The article also illustrates the prinicples that must guide arbitrators in their decisions regarding the application of competition law, including the criteria to identify the applicable competition law in complex international cases...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{intends to}} discuss the four facets of the {{application}} of the law to the merits in arbitration. The first and more classic one is a conflict of laws issue. What law (or laws) or rules (or sets of rules) should, or can, the arbitrator apply to the merits of the dispute? The second is that of how, having identified the applicable law or set <b>of</b> rules, <b>arbitrators</b> go about ascertaining the content of the law or rules to be applied to the merits. The third facet is how arbitrators should actually apply the law and rules to the merits, once they have identified them and ascertained their content. The fourth facet, which straddles the others, is that of mandatory rules: when, why and how should arbitrators apply mandatory rules and which ones should they apply? Specific legal rules exist only in relation to the first of these facets, and even those leave a great discretion to arbitrators. An inquiry into the criteria for the exercise of that discretion in relation to all the aspects of the application of substantive law – and the relevance of ethics in this context – is therefore fundamental to determine the proper conduct <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> {{as well as for the}} outcome of the arbitral process. Indeed, except in the marginal case of ex aequo et bono arbitration, together with the assessment of the facts the identification and application of the rules applicable to the merits is the most crucial aspect of an arbitration, the aim of which is the settlement of the dispute by application of the law. For the purposes of the present discussion, the term ethics is not used in its technical and philosophical sense of rules of behavior based on ideas about what is morally good and bad. It is used in the mundane sense in which it used in arbitration, as shorthand for the unwritten <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the participants in the arbitral process, particularly arbitrators, with regard to the fair and efficient conduct of the arbitration in the absence of enforceable legal obligations. Also with regard to {{the application of the}} law to the merits ethics can be seen to encompass the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrators</b> to “do a good job” as arbitrators. Spelled out, this is the duty to conform to the legitimate expectations of the parties and to standards of predictability, render a just and enforceable decision, avoid arbitrariness and respect general interests...|$|R

40|$|Jordan has {{witnessed}} a drastic development in its commercial relations, {{which has been}} accompanied by rapid economic development.   This has led to enactment of a new Arbitration Act, to replace the old one, which came into force on 15 August, 2001.   The new Act is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, and is therefore considered to be the closest equivalent to the Model Law, although it contains some amendments in its provisions, in order to comply with Jordanian legislation. Chapter one gives a background to arbitration, examines the development of arbitration and deals with {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} arbitration. Chapter two deals with the arbitration agreement.   The aim of this chapter is to consider the requirement of issuing a valid arbitration agreement and to show the effect of this agreement. Chapter three deals with two important doctrines of arbitration; the principle of separability of the arbitration agreement and the competence/competence doctrine.   This chapter deals with the foundations of the principle of separability and the consequences of adopting this principle.   This chapter also discusses the competence/competence doctrine, defining and clarifying it. Chapter four is devoted to the arbitral tribunal, covering the task of the arbitral tribunal in issuing a valid award, and dealing with the powers and <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator.</b> Chapter five identifies the arbitral award and identifies the question of legal existence of the arbitral award. Chapter six is devoted to dealing with challenges to an award and the conditions for such a challenge.   It also attempts to identify the question of the legal existence of the arbitral award in order to obtain leave from the court to recognise and enforce it.   Chapter seven is an evaluation of the new Jordanian Arbitration Act.   In this chapter, two questionnaires have been conducted and submitted to Jordanian lawyers and to the layperson in Jordan, asking them their opinion of the new Act.   In this chapter, I will try to analyse the results of these questionnaires.
