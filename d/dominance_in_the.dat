40|$|Abstract High vocal center (HVC) {{can produce}} single sound {{with one or}} two syllables by the sin-gle-type vocal control pattern in songbirds ruddy bunting (Emberiza rutila). It {{obviously}} shows left-side <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> controlling double syllables, principal frequency (PF) and increasing sound in-tensity of the evoked calls. Meanwhile, the complex-type control pattern can produce complex calls with multisyllable, and also shows significant left-side <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> controlling <b>the</b> number of sylla-bles, tone changing and sound intensity. These indicate that left-side HVC controls higher frequen-cy and complicated sentence structure. The basic vocal center, dorsomedial nucleus of the intercol-licular complex (DM), controls <b>the</b> monosyllable sound <b>in</b> songbirds, and shows left-side <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> controlling both <b>the</b> number of syllable and sound intensity. These results not only provide some direct evidence for left-side <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> high vocal center, but also indicate that there is some internal connection between the high and basic vocal centers in songbirds...|$|R

5|$|The {{effects on}} the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.

5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey.

The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1111, {{according}} to the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, {{the fact that the}} chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and {{at about the same time}} as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSome {{aspects of}} attentional {{processing}} {{are known to}} decline with normal aging. To understand how age affects the attentional control of perceptual stability, we investigated age-related changes in voluntarily controlled perceptual rivalry. Durations of the dominant percept, produced by an ambiguous Rubin vase-faces figure, were measured in conditions that required passive viewing and attentional control: holding and switching the dominant percept. During passive viewing, mean <b>dominance</b> duration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older group was significantly longer (63 %) than <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> duration found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young group. This age-related deficit {{could be due to}} a decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apparent strength of the alternating percepts as a result of higher contrast gain of visual cortical activity and a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of attentional resources allocated to <b>the</b> ambiguous stimulus <b>in</b> older people compared to young adults. In comparison to passive viewing, holding the dominant percept did not significantly alter <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> durations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older group, while <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> durations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young group were increased (∼ 100 %). The dominance durations for both age groups in switch conditions were reduced compared to their passive viewing durations (∼ 40 %). The inability of older people to voluntarily prolong the duration of the dominant percept suggests that they may have abnormal attentional mechanisms, which are inefficient at enhancing the effective strength of the dominant percept. Results suggest that older adults have difficulty holding attended visual objects in focus, a problem that could affect their ability to carry out everyday tasks...|$|R

5|$|The {{events of}} 1811 gave the British <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic for the {{remainder}} of the war.
