It is used in many fields {{of science and technology}} and has given major new insights into different problems. The relatively large penetration depth of x rays into matter makes them ideally suited for tomography. The combination of x-ray fluorescence analysis and scanning microtomography, hereafter called x-ray fluorescence microtomography, has been further developed and improved in this work. Employing the newly developed refractive x-ray lenses at a third generation synchrotron source the spatial resolution of this technique could be reduce to a micrometer. The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> that leaves the sample and can be detected from outside suffers absorption {{on its way to the}} detector. This problem of absorption is treated in this work, too and technical improvements of the setup are outlined. These improvements reduce the absorption of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation.</b> This in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> and lowers the detection limit. Moreover, a tomographic reconstruction algorithm is described which is especially designed for x-ray fluorescence tomography. This algorithm takes into account the absorption of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> within the sample. Some example applications are described to illustrate the success and power of this method as well as its advantages over other microanalytic methods. Also, the possible use of x-ray fluorescence microtomography in a laboratory is assessed.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> does {{not play a}} significant role in the performance of Cherenkov telescopes. However, this assumption is required to be verified using detailed Monte Carlo simulations. In order to do this, we have implemented the production and tracking of <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> inside the CORSIKA code, and simulated gamma-ray induced showers in the very high energy range. The most accurate fluorescence-yield data available so far was used for this purpose. The distribution of both light components on the ground has been studied as a function of various parameters affecting the detection and reconstruction of gamma-ray showers such as the angular aperture. From these distributions, we determined the conditions under which <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> becomes significant. These results will also be useful to estimate the corresponding systematic errors in Cherenkov telescope observations. The full simulation results have been cross-checked, on a small sample of events, against numerical calculations based on a one-dimension shower profile and found to be compatible with each other. Both tools can be used for further investigations, like studying the possibility to modify Cherenkov telescopes for the measurement of fluorescence induced by extensive air showers.

40|$|The lack {{of models}} {{describing}} {{the propagation of}} X-rays in waveguides and the interference mechanism between incident and reflected radiation waves hamper the understanding and the control of wave propagation phenomena occurring in many real systems. Here, experimental spectra collected at the exit of microchannel plates (MCPs) under the total X-ray reflection condition are presented. The results {{are discussed in the}} framework of a theoretical model in which the wave propagation is enhanced by the presence of a transition layer at the surface. The angular distributions of the propagating radiation at the exit of these MCPs with microchannels of ~ 3 µm diameter will also be presented and discussed. These spectra show contributions associated with the reflection of the primary monochromatic beam and with the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> originating from the excitation of atoms composing the surface of the microchannel. The soft X-ray fluorescence spectra collected at the exit of microcapillaries were analyzed in the framework of a wave approximation while diffraction contributions observed at the exit of these hollow X-ray waveguides have been calculated using the Fraunhofer diffraction model for waves in the far-field domain. Data collected at the Si L-edge show that in glassy MCPs the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>radiation</b> can be detected only when the energy of the primary monochromatic radiation is above the absorption edge for grazing angles higher than half of the critical angle of the total reflection phenomenon.
