The <b>issuing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> must complete a form stating identity and nationality of the person sought, the nature and legal classification of the offence, {{the circumstances surrounding the}} alleged committal of the offence including when and where it was committed and the degree of participation of the person sought, and scale of penalties for the offence.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor’s work {{deals with}} {{issue of a}} {{framework}} decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States of the European Union. The European Arrest Warrant, valid throughout the European Union has replaced earlier extradition procedures between Member States, such as the 1957 European Convention on Extradition (Council of Europe), that were applicable between the Member States. Such a warrant may be issued by a national <b>issuing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> if the person whose return is sought is accused, or if he has been sentenced to a prison term. The European Arrest Warrant means faster and simpler surrender procedures and no more political involvement. It also means that Member States can no longer refuse to surrender to another Member State their own citizens who have committed a serious crime, or who are suspected of having committed such a crime in another EU country, {{on the ground that}} they are nationals. Simplifying and improving the surrendering procedure between EU Member States was made possible by a high level of mutual trust and cooperation between countries who share the same highly demanding conception of the rule of law. Despite some initial delays, the European Arrest Warrant is now operational in most of the cases planned and its impact is positive, in terms of depoliticisation, efficiency, and speed in the procedure for surrendering people who are sought, while fundamental rights are respected throughout...|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{integration in}} the EU, made {{the rules of the}} mutual legal assistance insufficient. The old model of mutual assistance was replaced approaching the judicial cooperation within the EU to the cooperation between judges from the same State. For this purpose it was necessary to find a balance between unification and diversity. The selective interoperability between the diverse legal systems of the Member States was the {{solution to the problem of}} the fragmentation of the criminal Justice in the European Union. Not all the judicial decisions are interoperable, but only those that were defined as equivalent resolutions in the European common rules. In this system the recognition is widely guaranteed by establishing a compulsory distribution of the competences between executing and <b>issuing</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>authorities,</b> preventing the examination of the internal aspects and basis of the issued resolution by the judge of the executing State, and establishing a strong limitation of the grounds for refusal and of the elements that can be considered by the executing judge. All this together with some limited possibilities offered to the States to reduce the impact of the mutual recognition to protect the national legal identity...|$|R

Instead of introducing a new ground of refusal for a European Arrest Warrant based on the breach of fundamental rights, the CJEU opted for a ground of postponement. Furthermore, it brings its two-tier ‘systemic deficiencies’ test closer to the standards used by the ECtHR and encourages dialogue between the <b>issuing</b> and executing <b>judicial</b> <b>authorities.</b> Nevertheless, the scope of application of the new ground of postponement is not entirely clear and it is not yet sure what happens after the executing <b>judicial</b> <b>authority</b> postpones its decision due to evidence of a real risk that the requested person will be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the issuing Member State...|$|R
