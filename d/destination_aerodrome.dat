25|$|The VFR-Over-the-Top (VFR OTT) rating {{allows the}} holder to fly above and between cloud, without visual {{reference}} to the ground under visual flight rules during the daytime. Pilots are required to takeoff from an aerodrome in normal VMC and VFR and land at the <b>destination</b> <b>aerodrome</b> under VFR. The cruise flight in between may be flown under VFR OTT flight rules.|$|E
50|$|Air traffic {{management}} is an aviation term encompassing all systems that assist aircraft {{to depart from}} an aerodrome, transit airspace, and land at a <b>destination</b> <b>aerodrome,</b> including air traffic control (ATC), air traffic safety electronics personnel (ATSEP), aeronautical meteorology, air navigation systems (aids to navigation), Air Space Management (ASM), Air Traffic Services (ATS), and Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), or Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM).|$|E
50|$|The Canadian rules specify that an {{aircraft}} may be operated in VFR OTT flight during the cruise {{portion of the}} flight during the day, at a vertical distance from clouds of at least 1000 feet. When the aircraft is operated between two cloud layers, the vertical distance between the layers {{must be at least}} 5000 feet. The flight visibility at the cruising altitude of the aircraft must be at least 5 miles and the weather at the <b>destination</b> <b>aerodrome</b> must be forecast to have a sky condition of scattered cloud or better, a ground visibility of 5 miles or greater with no forecast of precipitation, fog, thunderstorm or blowing snow, and that these conditions must be forecast to exist for one hour before to two hours after the estimated time of arrival when a terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) is available or from one hour before to three hours after the estimated time of arrival if a TAF is not available.|$|E
50|$|In April 2007, {{three people}} were killed after their light {{aircraft}} crashed after take-off from the airport. Their <b>destination</b> was Andrewsfield <b>Aerodrome,</b> England.|$|R
40|$|Great {{interest}} in using unmanned aerial vehicles {{has recently been}} shown, both from economic entities, and from national security, defense and law enforcement agencies. However, for using UAV for the civil purposes {{there is now a}} number of problems which are connected with the use of airspace and without solving them it is impossible to use the UAV fully. It {{should be noted that the}} level of flight safety, both for regular aircraft, and for the UAV, has the primary value. It is necessary to use modern methods of data processing and to have an opportunity to quickly and effectively control the current flight safety level. For this purpose the fullest information on the current movement of aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, and also on the structure of the used airspace has to be used. The problem of procedures and maneuvers development that resolve potential traffic conflict including the UAV, is extremely important for air traffic safety especially in the vicinity of the <b>destination</b> or landing <b>aerodrome.</b> The possibility of creation of an algorithm of dynamic turn formation and the choice of a trajectory on approach of unmanned aerial vehicles is considered in this article. The technology of automatic dependent surveillance broadcast was used when collecting statistical data. Implementation of the landing algorithm is executed based on the criteria of ensuring efficiency and flight safety. The developed software provides the use only of open data on the aircraft movement in terminal airspace. The suggested algorithm can be adapted for air traffic management of the UAV in any selected airspace...|$|R
