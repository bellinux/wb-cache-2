50|$|Ifco trays (an {{acronym for}} {{international}} fruit container) are containers developed in Germany in 1992 which are primarily used in retail to hold {{fruit and vegetables}} and to transport fish. They are attractive for environmental reasons due to their ease of reuse, their capability of being stacked when full of produce in many different configurations {{and that they can}} be flattened when empty for compact return to producers/shippers/growers or for storage purposes. Their adoption has generated controversy between developed countries which are consumers of produce and developing countries which are producers, primarily due to the cost of using the trays as opposed to using locally produced containers. In particular, many developing countries lack the capital-intensive infrastructure to develop and support the hi-technology plastic molding machinery necessary to produce the returnable trays. Analysis continues to compare the relative benefits of reusable trays, which require a full cycle (use, cleaning and return) versus one-time-use <b>disposable</b> <b>containers</b> which do not require return to the shipper, but instead are disposed of after one use. <b>Disposable</b> <b>containers</b> create a waste-disposal burden on recipients while the returnable containers burden producers who must purchase containers and arrange for a return cycle.|$|R

For identification and quantitative determination of bisphnol A and nonylphenol, we used gas chromatography equipped with mass detector, and for quantitative determination of these two compounds, we used high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with fluorescence detector. Results: We found that increasing temperature increased significantly the rate of migration of these two compounds in the water.

Enzyme activity is determined by scintillation counting of the ultrafiltrate, after subtraction of radioactivity released {{in the presence of}} beta-aminopropionitrile, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Conditions are described which optimize both the sensitivity and the efficient use of substrate. The assay shows linear inhibition of activity in up to 1 M urea; hence, as the enzyme is normally diluted in the assay, samples in 6 M urea can be assayed directly, without prior dialysis, and corrected for partial inhibition. Comparable results are obtained when enzyme activity is assayed by ultrafiltration or microdistillation.

40|$|Moksha is the Sanskrit {{word for}} {{freedom from the}} cycle of rebirth. It {{is the goal of}} every living being. This thesis seeks a Moksha of the Machine Age. It {{attempts}} to explore the possibility of building value into "waste". The thesis looks at {{one of the most common}} items that makes up "waste" - the "disposable" container, and the design changes which if incorporated, can ensure a second life as a building brick. What are the costs and what the benefits? Can generic principles can be derived; principles that would make such a design intervention desirable or even possible? With the ultimate aim of gaining much needed help, in the housing sector, for the poorest of society. My inspiration comes from poor people, all over the Third World, who fashion almost all of their building material from the discarded objects. The first part of the thesis, records such building activity in present day New Delhi, India. The study of the squatter building techniques is accompanied by the study of an experiment carried out at the Heineken Breweries, c. 1961, to design their beer bottle such that it could serve as a brick after the bottle had been used. That attempt, had the blessings of the chief executive of Heineken Breweries, one of the biggest names in the business and the technical expertise of the eminent architect N. John Habraken. It proauced a completely feasible and very credible product. Yet it never found large scale implementation. Why? Will its contemporary reincarnation in plastic (HDPE) have any greater chances of success than the glass forerunner? These are some of the questions that the thesis looks at in the last chapter. As architects we are conditioned to seek ultimate proof of our ideas' validity in the world of physical reality. Thus in the course of this thesis I have followed the process of designing a <b>disposable</b> <b>container</b> from the geometric logic of a particular form through the iterations that are needed to rationalize it with respect to the requirements of the manufacturing process, to the final stage of manufacture. This thesis looks at general questions that surround the issue of designing "waste" for a second life as well at very specific steps needed to design an everyday container such that it could become a brick in its second life. by Projjal K.

40|$|Cal Poly Campus Dining has {{a goal of}} {{becoming}} a zero waste entity by providing their customers with alternative methods of disposing their trash. Their current operations produce waste, specifically their methods of packaging the food. Campus dining plans to be more sustainable by providing their customers with reusable containers. The objective of this implementation is to reduce waste produced from one-time use, <b>disposable</b> food <b>containers.</b> The success criteria for the desired system is based around the ability to track and measure the reusable containers to prevent further waste, while providing the user an accommodating environment to ensure they will choose the sustainable option. Our experiment was designed using three objectives: usability, readability, and durability. In order to best accommodate the Cal Poly community, one of the supporting teams calculated the number, and approximate locations, of the return bins that will be collecting the reusable containers. Another supporting team worked on modifying the trash bins currently used at their operations to collect the reusable containers, {{in order to provide}} a seamless transition for the customers. Based on the client’s suggestions, we tested two methods of tagging in order to track and measure the reusable containers. The methods tested were barcode and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Tests were performed on the containers while containing both tags to measure readability. The tags were read using a direct scanner and an indirect scanner. The ultimate goal was to utilize an indirect scanner in order to avoid an additional task for the current Campus Dining employees. The containers were also tested under different conditions, such as placing food inside the container, to test the readability of the tags. The results of the RFID tags ranked far superior when compared to the barcode tags. The measured readability with an indirect scanner of RFID and barcode tags was 100 % and 4. 16 %, respectively. The tags were then tested for durability. The reusable containers would need to be washed after each use through Cal Poly Campus Dining’s dishwasher, the Stereo Commercial Dishwasher model STPCW-ER. A sample of eleven RFID tagged containers was processed through fifty wash cycles. A quality check was performed to find ten of the eleven containers had no water infiltration on the RFID tag, providing a durability success rate of 91 %. The tagged containers were tested again for readability after the fifty wash cycles and all of the tags were read, including the tag that was exposed to water. In conclusion, it is our recommendation to move forward with the zero waste initiative in replacing the current dining <b>disposable</b> <b>containers</b> with RFID tagged reusable containers. The tags will be able to withstand the current cleaning methods, while providing accurate readings when returned into the designated bins. Campus dining will be able to avoid further waste by removing the need to purchase 177, 200 <b>disposable</b> <b>containers</b> annually.
