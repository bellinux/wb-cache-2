There are exceptions to this, however. In some cases (about 11%), only one gene of a bidirectional pair is expressed. In these cases, the promoter is implicated in suppression of the non-expressed gene.

40|$|New {{approaches}} using biotinylated-psoralen as a probe for investigat-ing DNA structure {{have revealed}} {{new insights into}} the relationship between DNA supercoiling, transcription and chromatin compaction. We explore a hypothesis that divergent RNA tran-scription generates negative supercoiling at promoters facilitating initiation com-plex formation and subsequent promoter clearance. Packaging DNA into chromatin creates a repressive environment. This is thought to reduce transcriptional noise and provide additional levels of gene regulation. Many processes have been described that alter chromatin architecture and facilitate or repress transcription. These include tran-scription factor binding, recruitment of RNA polymerases, ATP-dependent chro-matin remodeling and changes in histone modifications. The level of DNA super-coiling is also known to be important for transcription but remains poorly under-stood, as few techniques are available for directly investigating it. This is about to change: new approaches have recently been used for analyzing DNA topology in cells 1 - 3 and show transcription dependent changes in DNA supercoiling that impact on higher levels of chromatin structure. Furthermore, new data indicates that DNA supercoiling and <b>divergent</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> are linked providing new ideas for understanding the role of DNA topology in regulating gene transcription.

40|$|SummaryIn {{addition}} to their annotated transcript, many eukaryotic mRNA promoters produce divergent noncoding transcripts. To define determinants of divergent promoter directionality, we used genomic replacement experiments.

Promoter-associated RNAPII and H 3 K 4 -trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense TSSa-RNA positions; however, H 3 K 79 -dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating RNAPII, are only present downstream of TSSs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the mammalian pancreas is governed by various signaling processes and by a cascade of gene activation events controlled by different transcription factors. Here we show that the <b>divergent</b> homeodomain <b>transcription</b> factor Prox 1 is a novel, crucial regulator of mouse pancreas organogenesis. Loss of Prox 1 function severely disrupted epithelial pancreas morphology and hindered pancreatic growth without affecting significantly the genesis of endocrine cells before E 11. 5. Conversely, the lack of Prox 1 activity substantially decreased the formation of islet cell precursors after E 13. 5, during a period known as the “secondary transition”. Notably, this defect occurred concurrently with an abnormal increment of exocrine cells. Hence, {{it is possible that}} Prox 1 contributes to the allocation of an adequate supply of islet cells throughout pancreas ontogeny by preventing exocrine cell differentiation of multipotent pancreatic progenitors. Prox 1 thus appears to be an essential component of a genetic program destined to produce the cellular complexity of the mammalian pancreas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: <b>Divergent</b> <b>transcription</b> is a {{widespread}} phenomenon in mammals. For instance, short bidirectional transcripts are a hallmark of active promoters, while longer transcripts can be detected antisense from active genes in conditions where the RNA degradation machinery is inhibited. Moreover, many described long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed antisense from coding gene promoters. However, the general significance of divergent lncRNA/mRNA gene pair transcription is still poorly understood. Here, we used strand-specific RNA-seq with high sequencing depth to thoroughly identify antisense transcripts from coding gene promoters in primary mouse tissues. Results: We found that a substantial fraction of coding-gene promoters sustain <b>divergent</b> <b>transcription</b> of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) /mRNA gene pairs. Strikingly, upstream antisense transcription is significantly associated with genes related to transcriptional regulation and development. Their promoters share several characteristics with those of transcriptional developmental genes, including very large CpG islands, high degree of conservation and epigenetic regulation in ES cells. In-depth analysis revealed a unique GC skew profile at these promoter regions, while the associated coding genes {{were found to have}} large first exons, two genomic features that might enforce bidirectional transcription. Finally, genes associated with antisense transcription harbor specific H 3 K 79 me 2 epigenetic marking and RNA polymerase II enrichment profiles linked to an intensified rate of early transcriptional elongation.

In addition, we exploited natural genetic variation as a genome-wide “mutagenesis” strategy to identify DNA recognition motifs for transcription factors that promote common or subset-specific binding of the macrophage lineage-determining factor PU. 1.

The translocation places the HOX 11 coding sequence under the transcriptional control of TCR α/δ regulatory elements, resulting in ectopic expression of a normal HOX 11 protein in thymocytes. To investigate the oncogenic potential of HOX 11, we targeted its expression in lymphocytes of transgenic mice by placing the human cellular DNA under the transcriptional control of Ig heavy chain or LCK regulatory sequences. Only IgHμ-HOX 11 mice expressing low levels of HOX 11 were viable. During their second year of life, all HOX 11 transgenic mice became terminally ill with more than 75 % developing large cell lymphomas in the spleen, which frequently disseminated to thymus, lymph nodes, and other nonhematopoietic tissues. Lymphoma cells were predominantly clonal IgM+IgD+ mature B cells. Repopulation of severe combined immunodeficient mice with cells from hyperplastic spleens indicated that the HOX 11 tumor phenotype was transplantable. Before tumor development, expression of the transgene {{did not result in}} perturbations in lymphopoiesis; however, lymphoid hyperplasia involving the splenic marginal zones was present in 20 % of spleens.

40|$|Transcription of the virB gene, a {{transcriptional}} regulator {{of invasion}} genes {{on the large}} plasmid of Shigella flexneri, is strictly regulated by growth temperature; when bacteria are grown at 37 degrees C, virB transcription is highly activated, while at 30 degrees C the level of virB transcription decreases to less than 5 % of that at 37 degrees C. Transcription from the virB promoter is activated by VirF, which is encoded on the same plasmid, in a DNA superhelicity-dependent manner (T. Tobe, M. Yoshikawa, T. Mizuno, and C. Sasakawa, J. Bacteriol. 175 : 6142 - 6149, 1993). Here we provide evidence supporting the involvement of negative superhelicity in the thermoregulation of virB transcription.

Here, we have investigated how AraR controls transcription from the ara regulon in vivo. A deletion analysis of the ara promoters region showed that the five AraR binding sites are the key cis-acting regulatory elements of their corresponding genes. Furthermore, ORE 1 -ORE 2 and ORR 3 are auxiliary operators for the autoregulation of araR and the repression of araE, respectively.

Fusions containing the entire spacer region in which <b>divergent</b> <b>transcription</b> of the H 2 A and H 2 B genes is initiated result in low-level constitutive synthesis of beta-galactosidase (beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 23) in yeast. Regulated expression (which is characterized by periodic synthesis during the S phase of the cell cycle) is restored when a 1. 3 -kilobase HindIII fragment containing a small region of the 3 ' end of the H 2 B gene is present in either orientation. The regulatory activity in this region appears to be coincident with a sequence that supports autonomous replication in yeast...|$|E
40|$|The {{two most}} {{abundant}} transcripts derived from TR-DNA within plant cells transformed by an octopine strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens arise from <b>divergent</b> <b>transcription,</b> both originating within an ˜ 500 bp {{section of the}} T-DNA. Using a combination of subcloning and exonuclease digestion, a 479 -bp DNA fragment, directly flanked by the initiation codons for the two adjacent open reading frames, was isolated. The resulting DNA fragment was fused, in both orientations, to the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) gene of the transposon Tn 5 prior to introduction into Nicotiana tabacum cells via the Ti plasmid. The intergenic fragment was found to initiate expression of the NPT II gene in either orientation as assayed by kanamycin resistance of the transformed plant tissue {{as well as by}} enzymatic assay of the NPT II gene product. The plasmids described here are potential selection-expression vectors for plant systems...|$|E
40|$|Promoters were {{isolated}} at random from the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{by using a}} plasmid that contains a divergently arrayed pair of promoterless reporter genes. A comprehensive library was constructed by inserting random (DNase I-generated) fragments into the intergenic region upstream from the reporter genes. Simple in vivo assays for either reporter gene product (alcohol dehydrogenase or beta-galactosidase) allowed the rapid identification of promoters from among these random fragments. Poly(dA-dT) homopolymer tracts were present in three of five randomly cloned promoters. With two exceptions, each RNA start site detected was 40 to 100 base pairs downstream from a TATA element. All of the randomly cloned promoters were capable of activating reporter gene transcription bidirectionally. Interestingly, one of the promoter fragments originated in a region of the S. cerevisiae rDNA spacer; regulated <b>divergent</b> <b>transcription</b> (presumably by RNA polymerase II) initiated in the same region...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance of lymphoid {{homeostasis}} in {{a number}} of immunological and inflammatory contexts is served by a variety of regulatory T (Treg) cell subtypes, and depends on interaction of the transcription factor Foxp 3 with specific transcriptional cofactors. We report that a commonly used insertional mutant of FoxP 3 (GFP-Foxp 3) modified its molecular interactions, blocking Hif 1 a but increasing Irf 4 interactions. The transcriptional profile of these Treg cells was subtly altered, with an over-representation of Irf 4 -dependent transcripts. In keeping with Irf 4 -dependent function of Treg cells to preferentially suppress T cell help to B cells and Th 2 - and Th 17 -type differentiation, GFP-Foxp 3 mice showed a divergent susceptibility to autoimmune disease; protection against antibody-mediated arthritis in the K/BxN model, but greater susceptibility to diabetes on the NOD background. Thus, specific sub-functions of Treg cells and the immune diseases they regulate can be influenced by FoxP 3 ’s molecular interactions, which result in <b>divergent</b> immunoregulation. The <b>transcription</b> factor FoxP 3 plays a central role in specifying the differentiation and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells. FoxP 3 + Treg cells help maintain lymphoid homeostasis {{in a number}} of immunological contexts: tolerance to self vs autoimmune deviation, responses to pathogens or allergens, interactions with commensal microbe...|$|R
40|$|The DNA of the {{attenuator}} {{region of}} the histidine operon of Escherichia coli has been transcribed in a purified in vitro system and found to synthesize two major RNA transcripts. The first one, 180 nucleotides long, {{has been identified as}} the histidine-specific leader RNA. It contains the coding sequence for the leader peptide [Di Nocera, P. P., Blasi, F., Di Lauro, R., Frunzio, R. & Bruni, C. B. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 4276 - 4280] and is terminated at the attenuator site. Termination of transcription at this site is extremely efficient in the in vitro system. The leader RNA also has been detected in vivo in a minicell producer strain transformed with plasmids harboring the regulatory {{region of the}} histidine operon of E. coli. A second RNA molecule is synthesized in the in vitro system. It has a <b>divergent</b> direction of <b>transcription</b> with respect to the histidine leader RNA, but its role, if any, in the regulation of the histidine operon remains to be ascertained. The existence of the histidine leader RNA lends support to the regulatory mechanism which postulates that regulation of the histidine operon is dependent on the alternative secondary structures that the leader RNA may assume, depending on whether or not the histidine-rich leader peptide is translated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEukaryotes express {{three or}} more multisubunit nuclear RNA polymerases (Pols) {{referred}} to as Pols I, II, and III, each of which synthesizes a specific subset of RNAs. Consistent with the diversity of their target genes, eukaryotic cells have evolved <b>divergent</b> cohorts of <b>transcription</b> factors and enzymatic properties for each RNA polymerase system. Over the years, many trans-acting factors that orchestrate transcription by the individual Pols have been described; however, little effort {{has been devoted to}} characterizing the molecular mechanisms of Pol I activity. To begin to address this gap in our understanding of eukaryotic gene expression, here we establish transient-state kinetic approaches to characterize the nucleotide incorporation mechanism of Pol I. We collected time courses for single turnover nucleotide incorporation reactions over a range of substrate ATP concentrations that provide information on both Pol I’s nucleotide addition and nuclease activities. The data were analyzed by model-independent and model-dependent approaches, resulting in, to our knowledge, the first minimal model for the nucleotide addition pathway for Pol I. Using a grid searching approach we provide rigorous bounds on estimated values of the individual elementary rate constants within the proposed model. This work reports the most detailed analysis of Pol I mechanism to date. Furthermore, in addition to their use in transient state kinetic analyses, the computational approaches applied here are broadly applicable to global optimization problems...|$|R
