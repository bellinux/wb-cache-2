Within this process, four levels for analysis were introduced: the systemic setting, the training institution, the class and the learner. In the empirical part of the work, the practical-conceptual relevance of such a model as an orientation for practical action was discussed with professionals of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> The structure of the model as well as the derived factors of influence on knowledge acquisition of adult learners met the professional beliefs of the interviewed professionals, whereby the relevance of the model could generally be confirmed.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the promotion of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> for the unemployed is of major interest not only as to the quantity of subsequent transitions into employment, but also {{with regard to the}} quality of the employments gained. In this report we present an analysis of the transition into sustainable employment in consequence of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> supported by the European Social Fund (ESF maintenance benefit, general education modules) supplementary to promotion according to SGB III (German Social Code Book III). The impact analysis is focused on the transition into non-funded jobs liable to social security of more than half a year and more than one year duration. We use two comparison groups: (1) unemployed non-participants and (2) participants in <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> supported according to SGB III without supplementary ESF funding. The analysis covers participants in <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> funded by the ESF between 2000 and 2002. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from panel surveys (2003 / 2004 and 2006) of ESF-funded participants (census in every second employment agency district) and comparison persons who were selected by exact pre-matching on the basis of process-produced data from the Federal Employment Agency. Methods of event history analysis were applied (Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regressions) for impact analysis covering an observation period of up to six years. Our results show that participation in <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> supported by the ESF increased the transition probability into sustainable employment in the medium and long run compared to non-participation. In this respect ESF-funded participants have proven more successful than unemployed non-participants. Compared to statutory promotion according to SGB III the added value of ESF funding is reflected by the inclusion of unemployed persons who would not have participated without the maintenance benefit paid by the ESF or who, at least, would have participated under harder circumstances only. Participants additionally covered by the ESF were equally successful with respect to sustainability of employment compared to those supported merely along with SGB III.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comparative}} empirical {{analysis of the}} effects of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> on the individual duration of unemployment is carried out for western and eastern Germany. The information from the socio-economic panel for western Germany (1984 - 1994) and for eastern Germany (1990 - 1995) is used as a data basis. In addition to this there is a brief overview of the development of unemployment and the development of expenditure on <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> in order to make clear the relevance of the evaluation research for social policy. The modelling of the selection problem is done with the aid of matching approaches which are based on the estimation of a panel-probit model for the probability of participation. Discrete hazard rate models serve {{to determine the effects of}} <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> measures on the individual duration of unemployment. The empirical findings show a trend of positive effects for western Germany for courses lasting up to 6 months, which decrease, however, in the long-term (after 2 years). Courses lasting longer than 6 months, on the other hand, have no significant effects; they show more negative tendencies. For eastern Germany no significant effects can be observed, long courses also tend to have a negative effect. Owing to a lack of differentiated information about individual types of measure and the low case numbers in the samples, the empirical findings can be interpreted only as statements about trends.

It can be seen from this among other things that participation in <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> varies according to school and vocational qualifications as well as occupational status. Furthermore, the type of employment relationship, nationality and age are also connected with participation in further training. Finally, possible points of departure for removing barriers to further training are shown.

40|$|Whilst {{there is}} a {{reasonable}} research evidence base concerning the experiences of visually impaired young people during their compulsory education {{and in terms of}} their subsequent employment prospects, {{there is a}} paucity of evidence examining the transitions between these two elements of the lived experience of these young people, including their perceptions of their levels of independence and self-identity during transition. A sociocultural framework was utilised to explore the experiences of five young people with a visual impairment who had experienced challenges during their respective transition journeys from compulsory education into further education, training, employment and unemployment. Following in-depth semi-structured interviews with the participants themes were identified relating to the young people’s transition experiences, feelings of independence and sense of identity during the transition process and were explored using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings suggested that the young people participating in this research were largely content with the support that they received during their compulsory education but felt in need of greater levels of support in terms of developing resilience, self-advocacy skills, problem-solving and assertiveness in achieving a successful transition into <b>further</b> education, <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and employment and avoiding becoming not in education, employment or training (NEET).

40|$|Our paper {{investigates the}} {{relative}} effects of wage subsidies and <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> on the subsequent employment prospects of previously unemployed program participants. First, we outline a theoretical approach {{based on a}} firm's hiring decision. For the relative effectiveness of both labor market programs the assumption concerning the formation of human capital is crucial and leads to competing hypotheses for the medium and long term. On the assumption that wage subsidies {{have no effect on}} human capital they improve individuals' employment prospects less than training programs. Contrariwise, {{on the assumption that the}} formation of human capital on subsidized jobs equals that by formal training subsidization has the same employment effect as a training program. Second, we test the two hypotheses empirically, using a large administrative data set from Germany and statistical matching techniques. Our treatment groups consist of unemployed persons taking up subsidized employment or entering a <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> program, respectively, during March 2003. To exclude unemployment after program end we estimate the effect of keeping a subsidized job versus participating in training and taking up a job immediately afterwards. The results strongly support the latter of our competing hypotheses: Previously subsidized individuals and trained individuals who found a job immediately afterwards have the same employment rates. This leads to the conclusion that firms value training on a subsidized job as much as formal training programs...|$|E
40|$|New {{administrative}} data have recently permitted a differentiated and dynamic {{evaluation of the}} employment effects of measures of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> in Germany which have been conducted {{in the context of}} active labour market policy. The data available for this purpose include firstly data for the time of the Employment Promotion Act in the 1980 s and 1990 s, and secondly the data of the Integrated Employment Biographies (Integrierten Erwerbsbiografien (IEB)) for the Social Code III from the year 2000 onwards. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the results of currently presented evaluations on the basis of these new data sets. We report results from other studies as well as those from our own studies. The results show that the employment effects of measures of <b>further</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> are far more positive than suggested by studies conducted in the past on the basis of survey data. It can be seen however, that long training measures often do not show their positive effects until some years later. This requires panel data over a long period of time, which are currently only available for the 1980 s and 1990 s. For this reason, policy implications about the effectiveness of further training measures should not be drawn on the basis of short-term employment effects alone.

40|$|Career {{learning}} is especially relevant in a fast changing knowledge society and labor market, bringing individuals to self-directedness and employability {{in their life}} course. At the same time, a comprehensive theoretical framework for career learning in vocational education is missing. For this study, we participated in a three year research and development project, aiming to realize a career learning environment in a Dutch school for secondary vocational education and to contribute to theory building about career learning. The research questions were: (a) how can we understand (situate, define, conceptualize, measure) career learning and (b) how can the learning environment, and more specifically guidance conversations in <b>vocational</b> <b>training,</b> stimulate the career learning process?To answer the first question, a critical concept analysis was conducted, situating career learning from a discussion of what careers are today, how they develop and how career learning can thus be conceptualized. Since {{there is no consensus}} in current theories on career learning regarding concepts, and empirical research is scarce, it was decided to first test the propositions on which the only available validated instrument (a self-evaluation questionnaire for career competencies, based on Kuijpers, 2003) builds. From a longitudinal perspective  250 students have filled out the questionnaire on three occasions during their study career choice making process  it was shown that career competencies do develop, that this process is stimulated by career guidance in the learning environment, and that it leads to positive career outcomes. Given this strong evidence for the essential role of career guidance in the learning environment for career competency development, it was decided to focus <b>further</b> on <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> conversations as a potentially rich context for career guidance. For answering the second question, four empirical studies were conducted. The first study describes the initial situation of career guidance in <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> conversations in secondary vocational education. From an analysis of 24 video-recordings of <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> conversations for formal characteristics, content, form and relational components follows that the potential of the trialogue (communication between the student, teacher and mentor from practice) is hardly utilized. The second study examines any changes from that initial situation which resulted from a specific teacher training intervention. Results from the analysis of 30 conversations before and after training support the assumptions that guiding career learning can be stimulated, that <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> conversations can fulfill their potential for career learning and that the efforts made in educational reform now only partially have the desired effect on interactive behavior in actual guidance conversations. The third study offers from the Dialogical Self Theory a qualitative broadening of the analysis framework based on the concept of student positioning, with the new framework used in the fourth study for the analysis of 30 student guidance conversations. Results show that the most suitable teacher interventions to respond to student positioning in guidance conversations  aimed to stimulate a career learning process  must be dialogical, which implies stimulating students and supporting them in self-reflection and action for the future.

Further, being male increases the odds of receiving <b>vocational</b> <b>training,</b> implying that certain special interventions are required to encourage the girls to enrol in formal <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> programmes.|$|R
