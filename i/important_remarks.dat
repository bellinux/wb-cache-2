60|$|Although {{this may}} be very true inasmuch {{as it relates to}} the reader, yet to the {{traveller}} we must observe, in opposition to Mr. Gell, that nothing can be less useful than the designation of his route according to the ancient names. We might as well, and with as much chance of arriving at the place of our destination, talk to a Hounslow post-boy about making haste to 'Augusta', as apply to our Turkish guide in modern Greece for a direction to Stymphalus, Nemea, Mycenæ, etc., etc. This is neither more nor less than classical affectation; and it renders Mr. Gell's book of much more confined use than it would otherwise have been:--but we have some other and more <b>important</b> <b>remarks</b> to make on his general directions to Grecian tourists; and we beg leave to assure our readers that they are derived from travellers who have lately visited Greece. In the first place, Mr. Cell is absolutely incautious enough to recommend an interference on the part of English travellers with the Minister at the Porte, in behalf of the Greeks.|$|E

5000|$|Thank you, John.—Wernher von Braun to Houbolt {{upon the}} {{successful}} splashdown of Apollo 11. This passage is {{caught on a}} NASA film taken at Mission Control in Houston and possibly {{one of the most}} <b>important</b> <b>remarks</b> made in the history of U. S. manned spaceflight. If Houbolt had not pushed the LOR concept—risking his NASA career and professional reputation—it would have been unlikely the first successful lunar landing and return mission could be accomplished by President Kennedy's 1970 completion date. Von Braun recognized this and personally invited Houbolt to the control center for the event.|$|E

30|$|One <b>important</b> <b>remark</b> {{concerns}} the indirect coupling among the GBT’s {{degrees of freedom}} of orthogonal modes. Unlike the GBT’s linear analysis, where each model is solved completely isolated from the others, in the mixed model, {{this is no longer}} possible. The multi-freedom constraint transformation matrices build this indirect coupling, which requires solving a relative large linear system.|$|R

This is because the amount of active HS that would be necessary to introduce in the formula to achieve consistent agronomical results is too much high (around 75  kg per ha) [4] to be affordable from both economic and technical viewpoints, as will be discussed later on.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} with an <b>important</b> <b>remark.</b> Our {{discussion of the}} role of the distribution of physical attractiveness in the population highlights the challenge of implementing a valid instrumental variable strategy for the relative spouses’ BMI in the household. The corresponding ratios in the population, which in principle could be thought of as possible instruments (e.g., Morris 2006, 2007), are instead potential factors affecting household bargaining power by themselves, and not only through the spouses’ relative BMI, which invalidates them as instruments.|$|R
