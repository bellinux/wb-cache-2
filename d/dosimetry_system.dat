This SCK•CEN personal <b>dosimetry</b> <b>system</b> is nearly 30 years old, reaching the end of its life. Because the same system is no longer available on the market, a completely new <b>dosimetry</b> <b>system</b> will be needed. One of the possible <b>dosimetry</b> <b>system</b> candidates is the one based on Direct Ion Storage (DIS) technology. This is a system in-between passive and active dosimetry and has some remarkable advantages compared to present systems. This dosimeter, commercially known as Instadose 2, can communicate its results through a Bluetooth connection and should no longer be sent back to the dosimetry service. The objective of this work is to test this system for implementation in routine. This encompasses practical issues, like calibration and quality control issues, but also more formal type testing according to IEC International Standard 62387 “Radiation protection instrumentation – Passive integrating dosimetry systems for personal and environmental monitoring of photon and beta radiation”. This was done through a study on repeatability, a study on angular and energy response and environmental influences. The work is subdivided in three chapters.

To {{recognize the importance of}} radiation dosimetry to medical physics three new chapters {{have been added to the}} 14 chapters of the previous edition. Chapter 15 provides a general introduction to radiation dosimetry. Chapter 16 deals with absolute radiation <b>dosimetry</b> <b>systems</b> that establish absorbed dose or some other dose related quantity directly from the signal measured by the dosimeter. Three absolute dosimetry techniques are known and described in detail: (i) calorimetric; (ii) chemical (Fricke), and (iii) ionometric. Chapter 17 deals with relative radiation <b>dosimetry</b> <b>systems</b> that rely on a previous dosimeter calibration in a known radiation field.

The validity of this commissioning method has been tested by analysing in-vivo dosimetry results of 1220 patients acquired on seven linacs over a period of 5 years. The average deviation between EPID based isocentre dose and expected isocentre dose for these patients was (- 0. 7 +/- 3. 2) %.

40|$|Lithium formate {{has shown}} to be a {{material}} with properties suitable for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) dosimetry, among them up to 7 times higher sensitivity compared to alanine, which is a well-established EPR detector material for dose determinations in radiotherapy. The aim of this thesis was to further investigate the properties of lithium formate and develop the <b>dosimetry</b> <b>system</b> towards applications in radiotherapy. The intrinsic efficiency for energies of relevance to brachytherapy and the signal stability were investigated. The <b>dosimetry</b> <b>system</b> was expanded to include a smaller dosimeter model, suitable for measurements in dose gradient regions. An individual sensitivity correction method was applied to the smaller dosimeters to be able to perform dose determinations with the same precision as for the larger ones. EPR dosimetry in general is time consuming and effort was spent to optimize the signal readout procedure regarding measurement time and measurement precision. The system was applied in two clinical applications chosen for their high demands on the dosimetry system: 1) a dosimetry audit for external photon beam therapy and 2) dose verification measurements around a low energy HDR brachytherapy source. The conclusions drawn from this thesis were: dose determinations can be performed with a standard uncertainty of 1. 8 - 2. 5 % using both the original size dosimeters and the new developed smaller ones.

40|$|Radiation <b>dosimetry</b> <b>systems</b> {{are complex}} systems, {{comprised}} of a milieu of components, designed for determining absorbed dose after exposure to ionizing radiation. Although many materials serve as absorbing media for measurement, thermoluminescent dosimeters represent {{some of the}} more desirable materials available; yet, reliability studies have revealed a clear and definite decrement in dosimeter sensitivity after repeated use. Unfortunately, repeated use of any such material for absorbing media in ionizing radiation dosimetry will in time experience performance decrements; thus, in order to achieve the most accuracy and/or precision in dosimetry, it is imperative proper compensation be made in calibration. Yet, analysis proves the majority of the measured decrement in sensitivity experienced by dosimeters is attributable to drift noise and not to any degradation in dosimeter performance, at least, not to any great degree. In addition to investigating dosimeter reliability, implications for metrological traceability and influences for calibration, this monograph addresses certain errors in applied statistics, which are rather alarming habits found in common usage throughout the radiation dosimetry community.

The Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program (DOELAP) located at the Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory (RESL) at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is charged with evaluating and accrediting personnel <b>dosimetry</b> <b>systems</b> for a variety of research and engineering facilities nationwide. [] irradiating are used in DOELAP to deliver accident-and protection-level doses to personal dosimeters. It is absolutely paramount that the calibration radiation fiends are well characterized. During the summer of 1997, the DOELAP Calibration Laboratory Facility was remodeled to accommodate an increasing workload. Remodeling the laboratory facility and the installation of a new, automated control calibration system required a complete characterization of DOELAP'S 20 Ci [] beam, irradiated verify that the new DOELAP configuration was in compliance with the DOE Standard for Performance Testing of Personnel <b>Dosimetry</b> <b>Systems.</b> A rail mapping experiment determined that scatter from ancillary equipment and wails minimally affected exposure along the axis of the source beam, with the experimental exposure varying only 0. 25 % to 1 % from the theoretical exposure. In addition, a new procedure was authored to provide guidelines for future DOELAP rail mapping experiments. To ensure that all dosimeters receive the same dose during DOELAP irradiations, beam uniformity measurements were also source using both an ionization chamber and a film exposure. Beam uniformity results, using an ion chamber, showed a pronounced penumbra {{at the edge of a}} whole body phantom at 100 centimeters. The beam was fairly uniform at 200 centimeters. Beam uniformity results the DOELAP dosimeter mounting area showed that the beam was uniform at both 100 and 200 centimeters with maximum deviation of approximately 1 - 1. 5 %. Comparing beam uniformity results between the ionization chamber and the film exposures determined that using film was an acceptable practice for determining beam uniformity and requires less time. As an extension of this experiment, a new internal procedure for verifying beam uniformity was authored for future DOELAP use. Factors that convert exposure to dose equivalent (Cx) for the 20 Ci, irradiated were within DOELAP standards (DOE 1986). Characterization the DOELAP 20 Ci, [] source has verified that the new DOELAP configuration is in compliance with the DOE Standard for Performance Testing of Personnel <b>Dosimetry</b> <b>Systems...</b>|$|R
