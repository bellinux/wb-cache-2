40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Deoiling</b> of petroleum wastewater {{is a major concern}} in petroleum process engineering. The conventional design procedure for <b>deoiling</b> systems consists of nine consecutive stages involving different people or groups. This thesis considers reengineering the conventional procedure, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the process and productivity of people involved. The thesis then investigates the development of the appropriate computer support tools for the new procedure. The reengineering of the procedure is based on concepts proposed by Hammer (1990). The resulting procedure consists of four stages, where parallelism of the different tasks in the conventional procedure is explicitly considered. A model of the new procedure is described in UML (Unified Modelling Language). The advantage of using UML instead of using just natural language description is that UML uses graphical representation that is easy to use and less prone to ambiguity. Based on the new procedure, a decision support system called CODES (Conceptual DEsign of <b>deoiling</b> Systems) was designed and implemented. CODES supports the stages of wastewater assessment, equipment options at different locations, treatment disposal options and recommendations for final process configuration. Two Case Studies using operating field data are reported. The Case Studies using CODES proved to be straightforward to use and produced appropriate comments on the performance of the existing designs and proposed alternatives to satisfy the design requirements. CODES results agreed with knowledge from previous plant trials. The contribution of this thesis to the <b>deoiling</b> design process is twofold. Firstly, a critical review of the conventional procedure has resulted in a new one, which has potential benefits of improving a company's efficiency by reducing the number of people and activities involved, and shortening the design time. Secondly, the feasibility of applying the new procedure and CODES is successfully demonstrated through the case studies. Limitations and areas of extensions are also identified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract––Moringa oleifera (M. O) {{seeds are}} used as a primary {{coagulant}} in drinking water clarification due to presence of a water–soluble cationic coagulant protein, which is able to reduce the turbidity of treated water. Seeds are powdered and added to the water directly or after preparing crude extract. The seed kernels contain significant quantities of series of low molecular weight and water soluble protein, which carries positive charge to the solution. The protein is considered to act similar to a synthetic and positively charged polymer coagulant. When this protein is added to raw water, it binds with the predominantly negatively charged particulate making the raw water turbid. Under proper agitation these bound particulates then grow in size to form the flocks, which may be left to settle by gravity or removed by sedimentation. The study was carried out to observe the effectiveness of purification M. O. coagulant. The three forms of coagulants were used viz. Shelled blended, <b>Deoiled</b> powder and Protein powder. At optimum dosage, the percentage turbidity removal is found to increase with initial turbidity in case of all three coagulants. Among the three forms, protein powder has more removal efficiency than <b>Deoiled</b> and Shelled blended powder respectively. However, the amount of protein powder required for coagulation is least, followed by <b>Deoiled</b> and Shelled blended coagulants. Economics of all these three coagulants is compared with alum (chemical coagulant). Keywords––Moringa oleifera, coagulant, <b>deoiled,</b> turbidity I...|$|R

40|$|Supercritical CO 2 {{extraction}} {{has shown}} great potential in separating vegetable oils {{as well as}} removing undesirable oil residuals from natural products. The influence of process parameters, such as pressure, temperature, mass flow and particle size, on the mass transfer kinetics of different natural products has been studied by many authors. However, few publications have focused on specific features of the raw material (moisture, mechanical pretreatment, bed compressibility, etc.), which could play an important role, particularly in the scale-up of extraction processes. A review {{of the influence of}} both process parameters and specific features of the material on oilseed extraction is given in Eggers (1996). Mechanical pretreatment has been commonly used in order to facilitate mass transfer from the material into the supercritical fluid. However, small particle sizes, especially when combined with high moisture contents, may lead to inefficient extraction results.

40|$|A system able to {{simultaneously}} separate and pump a gas-liquid mixture was developed. It works efficiently {{and can be}} used in many applications (nuclear power plants, pulp and paper processing, petroleum extraction, etc.). However, this pump and separator system (PASS) was especially designed to handle air-oil mixture generated in aero-engine lubrication systems. The PASS combines three important functions of the scavenge part of the lubrication system: the deaeration and <b>deoiling</b> of the air-oil mixture generated in the bearing and gearbox sumps and the pumping of the oil towards the tank. These are critical functions for the engine. Indeed, a poor <b>deoiling</b> efficiency leads to a high oil consumption. This reduces the flight endurance, increases the size and weight of the oil tank and has a negative impact on the environment. Poor deaeration and pumping characteristics lead to problems in the cooling and the lubrication of the engine bearings. Integrating a PASS into the lubrication system allows considerable improvements (and simplification) to the lubrication system architecture. An important number of components are suppressed: the vent lines, the deoiler, the cyclone deaerator and the scavenge pumps. This reduces the size and the weight of the lubrication system and increases its reliability. Furthermore, an important part of this PhD thesis focuses on reducing the oil consumption in the PASS. This improves the flight endurance, reduces engine maintenance and working costs and is profitable to the environment. In addition to the development of an advanced PASS design system, the objective of this thesis was to obtain a good understanding of the separation processes occurring in the PASS and to develop theoretical models able to predict the separation performance for every working condition encountered in a typical aircraft flight. To achieve this goal, three main tasks were performed: the development of different two-phase measurement systems, the experimental tests of four different PASS architectures and the theoretical development (after an extensive literature review) of correlations predicting the performance of the PASS in function of the working conditions. Five specific aspects of the PASS were studied: the inlet flow, the <b>deoiling</b> efficiency, the deaeration efficiency, the pumping efficiency and the pressure drop. Finally, the models that have been developed {{with the help of the}} measurement systems and of the experiments have been integrated in a complete model of the lubrication system (under the EcosimPro modelling environment). This helps to predict real in flight PASS working conditions and performance. Indeed, the PASS is very sensitive to the engine working conditions and an optimisation of the prototype size and performance is only feasible with an accurate knowledge of these working conditions and a complete lubrication system model. Finally, with the results of this PhD thesis, a new PASS design, optimised for different aero-engine lubrication systems, is presented.

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with four- factor- five level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to investigate the effects of extrusion conditions including moisture content of different raw flours, feed composition, barrel temperature and screw speed of extruder on properties of extrudates was studied. Second order quadratic regression model fitted adequately in the variation. The significance was established at P ≤ 0. 05. The regression models {{can be used to}} interpret the effect of feed composition, moisture content, screw speed and barrel temperature on the properties of the final product. It was shown that higher rice bran in feed composition showed in minimum water absorption index and maximum water solubility index. Numerical optimization technique resulted in 123. 83 °C of barrel temperature, 294. 68 rpm of screw speed, 13. 94 % of feed moisture and 17. 73 % of <b>deoiled</b> rice bran. The responses predicted for these optimum process conditions resulted water absorption index, 5. 91468 g/g and water solubility index of 18. 5553 % for the development of value added product with health benefits...|$|R
40|$|Distillers grains (DG) {{contribute}} to cattle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane instability by increasing poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) {{content in the}} SR membrane, possibly resulting in early postmortem calcium (Ca) leakage and improved tenderness. Mitochondria are relatively easy to isolate intact and provide the opportunity to study Ca in an SR model. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the influence of diet and oxidation on Ca release from mitochondria. Cattle (n= 48) were fed a corn-based finishing diet with or without <b>deoiled,</b> dried DG (50...|$|R
