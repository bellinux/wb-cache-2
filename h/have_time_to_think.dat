25|$|Notwithstanding Creelman’s glorified {{account of}} Díaz, Creelman does {{highlight}} the immediacy Díaz took to establish order—and fear—into dissenters of law {{as soon as}} he went into power in 1876. Díaz created localized bands of vigilantes, knowns as the rurales, who “punish robbery with death and requir the execution of culprits within a few hours after they were caught.” If the thief was not caught within a few hours, the chief officer of the given district would suffer the consequences. The same was said for the hacienda owner whose presumed thief Indian was not caught. Díaz continues: “It is true that we were harsh….to the point of great cruelty…. it was necessary then to the life and progress of the nation. The results have justified it” since “Mexico needed peace, even an enforced peace, that the nation might <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and work.” Creelman supports Díaz and states that even though Díaz “straighten out the public debt,” economized public expenditure, and industrialized the country, “his eyes were ever fixed on… a peace born of constructive and persuasive statesmanship, backed by strength, but to be maintained by force alone, when necessary—as the indispensable preliminary and accompaniment of national regeneration” In the long run, brutality and cruelty, according to Creelman’s interview of Díaz, were necessary elements to bring order, progress, and peace to Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E
