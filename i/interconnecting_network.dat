In angiosperms the venation is typically parallel in monocotyledons and forms an <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network</b> in broad-leaved plants. They were once thought to be typical examples of pattern formation through ramification, but they may instead exemplify a pattern formed in a stress tensor field.|$|E

This type can be divided into two subtypes. Stylolites of subtype A are characterized by higher amplitudes. They are related to the bedding either horizontally, or at a small angle. Stylolites of subtype B usually appear in rocks which have been affected by tectonic and/or metamorphic activity. These stylolites have a low amplitude with undulations. Their relation to the bedding can vary from horizontal to vertical.|$|E

5000|$|Salvia anastomosans is a {{branching}} shrub up to 2 m (80 inches) tall. Much of {{the shoot}} {{is covered with}} small branching hairs. Leaf blades are narrowly oblong, up to 4 cm (1.6 inches) long. Flowers are borne in racemes in the axils of the leaves and at {{the tips of the}} branches, with the flowers in clumps at the nodes. The calyx appears white because of the dense covering of branched hairs. Corolla is blue. The species epithet [...] "anastomosans" [...] refers to the unusual anastamosing nature of the veins in the leaf, forming an <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network</b> rather than having each vein end abruptly without connecting with another.|$|E
50|$|At the time, Sweden was {{a nation}} under the yoke of the Social Democratic Party of Sweden, which had ruled the country's {{government}} for over 40 years. Huntford argues {{that this had}} led to the complete dominance of socialist thought {{at all levels of}} the government, including the bureaucracy and the judiciary, which were all controlled by a powerful <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network</b> of Social Democratic labour unions, lobby groups, and partisan organizations. He also points to the fact that these networks made it very difficult for non-socialists to achieve any position of real power in Sweden, but noted that few Swedes seemed to view this massive politicization of their state with any concern.|$|E
50|$|A {{virtual circuit}} (VC) {{is a means}} of {{transporting}} data over a packet switched computer network {{in such a way that}} it appears as though there is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination end systems of this data. The term virtual circuit is synonymous with virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or virtual circuit may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network.</b> After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be delivered between the nodes; hence, a virtual circuit protocol allows higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into segments, packets, or frames.|$|E
30|$|The {{interconnecting}} {{structure of}} multiple networks {{is important in}} ensuring the aforementioned properties in information networks. A set of networks with scales that are not too large to be controlled and managed is considered as a large network, which is termed as an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network.</b> The Internet itself is an <b>interconnected</b> <b>network</b> wherein numerous mutually connected networks are operated by Internet service providers (Bailey 1997). Future information networks, including the future Internet, will involve {{an enormous number of}} <b>interconnected</b> <b>networks</b> managed by different administrators (Gubbi et al. 2013). It is not possible to guarantee the reliability and efficiency of the network since it is not feasible for a single administrator to manage the entire network. To limit this potential drawback, this study examines the design of <b>interconnected</b> <b>networks</b> to provide high robustness and efficiency.|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{have been}} looking for a {{material}} that can mimic tissue properties to make the tissue engineering process more effective and less invasive to the human body. The porous, <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network</b> of nanocomposite hydrogels, created through cross-link, enable wastes and nutrients to easily enter and exit the structure, and their elastomeric properties let them acquire the desired anatomical shape without needing prior molding. The porous structure of this material would also make the process of drug delivery easier where the pharmaceutical compounds present in the hydrogel can easily escape and be absorbed by the body. Aside from that, researchers are also looking into incorporating nanocomposite hydrogels with silver nanoparticles for antibacterial applications and microorganism elimination in medical and food packing and water treatment.Hydrogels infused with nanoparticles have a number of biological applications, including: tissue engineering, chemical and biological sensing and drug and gene delivery.|$|E
50|$|Acropora cytherea is {{a colonial}} species of coral that grows in large {{horizontal}} plates. These are formed of many tiny branchlets growing vertically or {{at an angle}} and others growing horizontally to extend the colony. They may branch and link together and near the centre the plates may become a solid mass of joined branchlets. The surface of the coral is covered by {{a thin layer of}} living tissue. This has a rough surface and contains zooxanthella, symbiotic, unicellular, photosynthetic algae. These give the coral its cream or pale brown colour (occasionally pale blue). The calcium carbonate skeleton is secreted by many small polyps which are joined together through an <b>interconnecting</b> <b>network</b> of channels inside the skeleton. At night, and sometimes during the day, the polyps protrude from the skeleton and extend their tentacles to feed. At other times, they contract back into the safety of the skeleton. In older specimens, particularly those exceeding 2 m in diameter, the regular structure sometimes breaks down near the centre and there are growth anomalies. It has been found that these are not deleterious to the survival of the coral and may be caused by stress factors such as raised sea temperatures.|$|E

This data illustrates {{the difficulty of}} obtaining high-quality signal, power, clock and thermal <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> for gigascale 2 D and 3 D integrated circuits. Specific material, process, circuit, packaging, and architecture solutions to enhance these four types of <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are proposed and quantitatively evaluated. A microchannel-cooled 3 D integrated circuit technology is developed to deal with thermal interconnect problems inherent to stacked dice. The benefits of carbon nanotube technology, improved repeater insertion techniques and parallel processing architectures for signal <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> are evaluated. A circuit technique to periodically reverse current direction in power <b>interconnect</b> <b>networks</b> is proposed.

SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and crossbar system were fail to performed communication in side SoC. Interconnection networks offer an alternate solution to this communication paradigm and are becoming persistent in SoC. A NoC based <b>interconnect</b> <b>network</b> is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation.
