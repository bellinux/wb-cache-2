Jack Endino (producer) told me it looks like a song from another time". It is {{featured}} in two versions: one recorded in Seattle and a slower one recorded in São Paulo nine months later. Reis compares it to the song [...] "Isn't It a Pity", by George Harrison, released under two different versions in All Things Must Pass (1970). The song was composed after his wife, Vânia, 2,5 years before the album release. [...] "It is a beautiful song, somehow sad, {{but it is also a}} revision of a long love story which is never linear ... it is about this love that resists <b>detrition,</b> about knowing what one wants, despite everything. The chorus summarizes it well and cites a verse by Lupicínio: 'Não consigo dormir sem seus braços' can't sleep without your arms. It's shards and sections of a relationship which compose a beautiful mosaic." [...] About the song and its versions, he also said: ...|$|E

Over two dozen strikes were held {{in the first two years}} of the program. One common method used to increase their wages was by “loading sacks” which consisted of braceros loading their harvest bags with rock in order to make their harvest heavier and therefore be paid more for the sack. [...] Also Braceros learned that timing was everything. Strikes were more successful when combined with work stoppages, cold weather, and a pressing harvest period. [...] The notable strikes throughout the Northwest proved that employers would rather negotiate with Braceros than to deport them, employers had little time to waste as their crops needed to be harvested and the difficulty and expense associated with the Bracero program forced them to negotiate with Braceros for fair wages and better living conditions. [...] Braceros were also discriminated and segregated in the labor camps. Some growers went to the extent of building three labor camps, one for whites, one for blacks, and the one for Mexicans. The living conditions were horrible, unsanitary, and poor. One example of this is in 1943 Grants Pass, Oregon 500 braceros were food poisoned which was one of the most severe cases of food poisoning reported in the Northwest. 300 of them required hospitalization. This <b>detrition</b> of the quality and quantity of food persisted into 1945 until the Mexican government intervened. [...] Lack of food, poor living conditions, discrimination, and exploitation led Braceros to become active in strikes and to successfully negotiate their terms.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{forms of}} Brazilian relief cannot be {{understood}} without the comprehension of what occurs with the South America relief. The structural and sculptural processes developed in Brazilian relief are straightly related with the Atlantic opening {{and the formation}} of Andes Orogenic Chains. The Meso-Cenozoic epeirogenesis unleashed the denudational processes that set a definite mark in Brazilian relief formation. The great forms are associated with structures of Cratons, Orogenic Belts and Sedimentary Basins. These great morphologies are produced by several Pre and Post-Cretaceous erosive phases under the effect of the ancient tectonic and the Cenozoic. High altimetry positions coincide with lithologies of igneous mass and rocks of high metamorphism and, downgraded reliefs sculpted on rocks of low metamorphism that suggest important effects of chemical <b>detritions</b> operating on the genesis of shapes of the Brazilian relief...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic {{patients}} frequently present {{composite resin}} restorations, however {{there are few}} studies that evaluate {{the best way for}} orthodontic bonding in this situation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to evaluate the bond strength of orthodontic brackets in resin restorations with surface treatment. METHODS: Fifty one bovine lower incisors were randomly divided into three groups. On the control group (CG) the brackets were bonded to dental enamel; on experimental groups, brackets were bonded to resin restoration with diamond drill treatment (EGT) and with no treatment (EGN). The teeth were placed in PVC tubes with autopolymerized acrylic resin. The shear test was performed in EMIC universal testing machine. The groups were submitted to ANOVA analysis of variance with Tukey post test to verify the statistical difference between groups (&# 945; = 0. 05). RESULTS: CG (6. 62 MPa) and EGT (6. 82 MPa) groups presented similar results, while EGN (5. 07 MPa) obtained statistically lower results (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is concluded that the best technique for bonding of orthodontic brackets on composite resin restorations is the performance of surface <b>detritions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Very little {{research}} has been carried out on detrital energetics and pathways in lotic ecosystems. Most investigations have concentrated on the degradation of allochthonous plant litter by fungi, with a glance at heterotrophic bacteria associated with decaying litter. In this short review, the author describes what is known of the <b>detrition</b> of plant litter in lotic waters, which results from the degradative activities of colonising saprophytic fungi and bacteria, and goes on to relate this process to those invertebrates that consume coarse and/or fine particulate detritus, or dissolved organic matter that aggregates into colloidal exopolymer particles. It is clear that many of the key processes involved in the relationships between the physical, chemical, biotic and biochemical elements present in running waters are very complex and poorly understood. Those few aspects for which there are reliable models with predictive power have resulted from data collections made over periods of 20 years or more.

40|$|The {{removable}} partial dentures (RPD) {{are used}} to reestablish the phonetics, aesthetics and masticatory function for partially dentate patients, mainly those who compound the Brazilian poorest population, since RPD presents a relatively low cost. The rehabilitation gone to be successfully when besides the planning, the dentist orientate hygiene habits to the patient, and proserve the case. The present paper evaluates hygiene habits and RPD planning among a sample of RPD wearers, in a cross-sectional design. A questionnaire was applied and a clinical examination was performed by two previously calibrated examiners. The sample was composed by 83 patients, and 25 were males. It was verified that 49. 4 % of the patients brush their teeth three times per day and that 28. 9 % took approximately 4 minutes for each teeth brushing, 95. 2 % use other hygiene resources, besides toothbrushing, as dental cream (98. 7 %), dental floss (79. 7 %) and mouthrinses (55. 7 %). However 56. 6 % showed bacterial plaque and 21. 7 % presented caries at clinical exam. About the dentures, 74. 7 % was definitive RPD and 96. 4 % showed bilateral design. The requisites of stability, retention, occlusion and aesthetics was classified as good, {{in the majority of}} the cases; the hygiene was classified as good to regular. In 24 % of the dentures, the base was deformed or fractured, 50. 6 % presented artificial teeth with <b>detritions.</b> Instead of patients’ adequate oral hygiene habits and satisfaction with RPD, more comprehensive explanations about oral care and more frequent follow-ups should be considered to improve plaque index and periodontal health among RPD wearers...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis of}} the title: "Emotionality {{in the job}} of a nurse" deals with the emotional company of a nurse which is part of experiencing in her assisting profession. In the course of every common and special day people experience a wide scale of various emotions not only in their everyday lives but also in their professions. The profession of a nurse belongs to an assisting profession and therefore in patients' eyes a nurse should be the one who has understanding for their problems during the illness and who helps to solve them {{with a great deal of}} tolerance and kindness. In her profession a nurse must fight with emotional tiredness, <b>detritions</b> and deformation leading to a state of cynicism which results in a simplified view of the ill and their problems. Next to their work, the mission of nurses is to be able to care well about the ill and never forget that a patient is first of all man, whose interests just they should protect. Literature mentions the fact that it is important to realize that a nurse does not work only for the ill ones, but particularly with them { [...] } which this thesis confirms. The theoretical part aims at emotionality as part of experiencing, emotions, at the job description of a nurse, her relation to the patient, empathy. Further it deals with various risks endangering the nurse from the psychological point of view, self-control and methods for mental health sustenance of a nurse. The second part of the thesis is a research part. The thesis has set two goals: the first goal is to determine how nurses react emotionally to patients' problems. The second goal is to determine which factors positively influence suitable nurses' emotional reactions to patients' problems. On the basis of these goals two research questions were set: 1) How do nurses emotionally react to patients' problems? and 2) Which factors positively influence suitable emotional reactions of nurses to patients' problems? To meet the goals of the thesis I used the method of a qualitative research survey. The survey is performed with the technique of non-standard dialogue which was provided by seven nurses working in the home for elderly people in Dobrá Voda...|$|R
40|$|All {{historic}} dental collections {{share the}} fact that an expansion phase is followed by a utilization phase. However the objects become more important for the dental histo-rian not until they enter the historical phase. This can be demonstrated with Friedrich Carl Ferdinand Busch’s research collec-tion. This research collection comprises special kinds of wall charts that were formed out of more than 7 500 teeth. With regards to content this way gives the opportunity to adept substantial dental theoretical knowledge including significant therapies of the ending 19 th century. This was enough of a reason to choose these teeth wall charts as subject of this underlying dissertation and to prepare them for handing over to the Medical Historical Museum of Berlin and thus conserve the valuable assets. Busch prepared several teeth wall charts of handy size from these extraction objects for lectures. If one considers the average number of teeth on the presently eight original wall charts as well as the overall number of teeth mentioned by Busch it can be assumed that there must have been once more than the 160 wall charts in existence. During reconstruction more than 2 117 teeth could be identified. A major loss has to be noticed with regard to objects with caries. When systemizing anomaly of teeth Busch formed the distinction of the “Mehrfach-gebilde” that is used until present and included also the “Dens in dente” because of histological diagnostics. Busch initiated the cause study of less mineralized remaining teeth and he rightly saw the connection of this with the damage of the primary dentition. Busch diagnosed the osteoclasts as the damaging factor at the resorptive changes. The reason for his studies were the replantations that were often accompanied with painful resorptions. The only acceptable indication for Busch was the tooth conservation at hopeless diagnosis. He did not consider the periodontium that needs to be treated with care. Because of this misjudgment his recommended thera-py gives no starting point for a therapy development. He recognized correctly that deficits in mineralization, caused by children`s illness, is the reason for extensively cariously damaged first molars, if the growth of the root is not finished. Furthermore he asserted that caries with 50 % is the most important reason for extraction. Further research was done by Miller, who developed the chemical-parasitäre theory in 1889. His comparing anatomic studies show results about the <b>detritions</b> of the teeth. He thought that mechanical factors that were increased through chemical influences were of importance. However, it is highly likely that the research results have to be credited to Miller. The tooth discolouring appeared Busch to be important, even so he only presented few discoulered objects. Busch discovered the bleaching effect of hydrogen perox-ide for therapeutic reasons; however, the therapy done today is done according to Miller. Buschs‘ research regarding the healing of the dental pulp and dentine in search for not physiological stimuli resulted in the detection of different formed dentine. It is regretfully, that he did not conclude from his research results to the possibility of pre-servation the vitality of teeth...|$|R
30|$|Corrosion {{is as old}} as {{the earth}} itself known to people as rust; {{corrosion}} is an undesirable phenomenon which destroys the luster and beauty of the metal and lessens their life. Corrosion is the destruction and deterioration of metals as a result of reaction with environment (Fontana and Greene 1987). It is a major problem that must be confronted for safety, environmental and economic reasons in various chemical, mechanical, metallurgical, biochemical, and medical engineering applications, and more specifically in the design of a much more varied number of mechanical parts which equally vary in size, functionality, and useful lifespan (Desai 2015). One of the most challenging and difficult tasks is to provide the protection of metals from corrosion. Controlling these <b>detritions</b> of metals and alloys is a costly course of action, and industries pay out enormous amounts to manage this crisis. The controlling expense of corrosion in the developed countries such as the USA and European Union is about 3 – 5 % of their gross national product (Bhaskaran et al. 2005).The use of corrosion inhibitors is the most reasonable and realistic way to protect metals from corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors decrease the rate of corrosion when added into the surrounding or solution of metals. They are either synthetic or natural. However, the attractiveness and use of synthetic compounds (Guendouz et al. 2013; Belfilali et al. 2012; Moreira et al. 2014; Ajmal et al. 1994; Lagrenee et al. 2002; El-Maksoud 2004; Elachouri et al. 1996; Kilmartin et al. 2002; Nishimura 1993; Kabanda and Ebenso 2012; Kabanda et al. 2012 a; Kabanda et al. 2012 b) as a corrosion inhibitor is losing ground because of their noxious and hazardous effects on mankind. Therefore, necessities occur to build up a different category of corrosion inhibitors with low poisonous effect, environment friendly and effective efficiency. This new general approach, called green chemistry, was declared which aims for the reduction and replacement of hazardous materials {{in order to protect the}} environment and people. Plants have been used by human beings for their basic needs and seem to be a promising source of cheap and harmless corrosion inhibitors. The oldest uses of plants were reported as corrosion inhibitor of Chelidonium majus (celandine) and other plants in 1930 s (Raja and Sethuraman 2008). After this discovery, natural products drag the attention of scientists around the world for the research on plant extracts for corrosion inhibition. Among others, considered substances are gums, animal proteins, herbs, and even fruit peals (Africa 2008; Al-Otaibi et al. 2014; Oguzie 2006; Abdel-Gaber et al. 2009; Oguzie 2007; Kliškić et al. 2000; Benabdellah et al. 2006; Abiola et al. 2007; Raja and Sethuraman 2009; El-Etre et al. 2005). Gums have been found to be good corrosion inhibitors due to their functional group; they form complexes with metal ions and on the metal surfaces. Most gums have -COOH functional groups, which can increase the contribution of electron or charge transfer and hence facilitate inhibition through adsorption. Literature on the use of gums as corrosion inhibitors is very little (Eddy et al. 2013; Abdallah 2004; Umoren et al. 2008; Ameh et al. 2012). Guar gum drags special attention because of its safe use and high molecular size. The gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS) spectra of the gum show the presence of heteroatoms. Gum metal complexes occupy a large surface area, thereby blanketing the surface and shielding the metal from corrosive agents present in the solution. The presence of arbinogalactan, sucrose, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glucoprotein confirms the presence of compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen atoms there, which are the active centers of adsorption (Gardner and Eikerts 1983; Bumgartner et al. 1983; Shah and Walters 1984; Peter et al. 2015).|$|R
