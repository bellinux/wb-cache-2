5|$|Generally, <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> {{costly to}} provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} {{judicial}} organisation, {{as a consequence}} of its status of county capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej, Gherla, Turda and Huedin. Appeals from these tribunals' verdicts, and more serious cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.|$|E

50|$|Because the Cheshire <b>justices</b> <b>were</b> free to {{practise}} as barristers in the English courts or sit in Parliament, {{the post}} of Chief <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> often awarded {{as a form of}} patronage by the Government to aspiring lawyers. The offices of Chief and Puisne <b>Justice</b> <b>were</b> abolished in 1830, as part of reforms that also brought Wales {{under the jurisdiction of the}} courts at Westminster.|$|R

5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|King Arthur & the Knights of <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure game {{developed}} by Manley & Associates {{and published by}} Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in May 1995. Based on the cartoon series of the same title, which was loosely inspired by the Arthurian legend, the game was released in North America exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's theory {{centers on}} the notion that <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> the {{essential}} characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E
50|$|Royal <b>justices</b> <b>were</b> an {{innovation}} in the law reforms of the Angevin kings of England. Royal <b>justices</b> <b>were</b> roving officials of the king, sent to seek out notorious robbers and murderers {{and bring them to}} justice.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{currently}} has six men and three women justices. Among the nine <b>justices,</b> there <b>is</b> one African-american (<b>Justice</b> Thomas) and one Hispanic (Justice Sotomayor). Two of the <b>justices</b> <b>were</b> born {{to at least}} one immigrant parent: <b>Justice</b> Alito's parents <b>were</b> born in Italy,, and <b>Justice</b> Ginsburg's father <b>was</b> born in Russia.At least five <b>justices</b> <b>are</b> Roman Catholics and three are Jewish; it is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian. The average age is 67 years and 4 months. Every current justice has an Ivy League background. Four <b>justices</b> <b>are</b> from the state of New York, two from California, one from New Jersey, one from Georgia, and one from Colorado.|$|R
2500|$|The {{position}} of Minister for <b>Justice</b> has <b>been</b> in continuous existence since the promulgation of Luxembourg's first constitution, in 1848. [...] Originally, <b>justice</b> <b>was</b> within the remit of the Administrator-General for Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Religion (Administrateur général des Affaires étrangères, de la Justice et des Cultes), but <b>justice</b> <b>was</b> separated from this office on 23 September 1853.|$|R
5|$|The {{judicial}} {{branch is}} made up of several levels. The state supreme court, with four justices and a chief <b>justice,</b> <b>is</b> the highest court in the state. Below the supreme court are the circuit courts; 41 circuit judges serve in seven judicial circuits in the state. Below the circuit courts are the magistrate courts, which deal with more minor criminal and civil actions.|$|E
5|$|Yama, as Lord of <b>Justice,</b> <b>is</b> called Dharma-raja. Yama {{sends the}} virtuous to Svarga {{to enjoy the}} luxuries of paradise. He also assesses the vices {{of the dead and}} accords judgement, {{assigning}} them to appropriate hells as punishment commensurate with the severity and nature of their sins. A person is not freed of samsara (the cycle of birth-death-rebirth) and must take birth again after his prescribed pleasure in Svarga or punishment in Naraka is over.|$|E
5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length of Supreme Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the chief justice or the acting chief justice must do so. The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The chief justice presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission. The chief justice also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission.|$|E
5000|$|The longest-serving Associate <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> American E. Finley Johnson, {{who served}} in that {{position}} for 29 years, 5 months and 27 days, from 1903 to 1933. The longest serving Filipino Associate <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> Florentino Torres, who served for 18 years, 10 months, and 3 days, from 1901 to 1920. Justices Ramon Avanceña and Cesar Bengzon would serve longer in the Court than Torres, but their tenure as Associate <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> terminated by their respective promotions to Chief Justice.|$|R

50|$|The {{office of}} Chief <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> created in 1861 when the Supreme Court was {{established}} through the amalgamation of the Court of Quarter Sessions and the Civil Court. The first Chief <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> the West Indian born Sir Archibald Burt. Initially, {{in line with}} the British colonial policy of the time, the Chief <b>Justices</b> <b>were</b> appointed by the Colonial Office from outside the colony. It was not until 1901 that Western Australia had its first Western Australian born Chief Justice.|$|R
5|$|Four of {{the five}} {{principal}} organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City. The International Court of <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi. Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. On {{the basis of the}} Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.|$|E
5|$|Its Supreme Court, {{headed by}} the Chief <b>Justice,</b> <b>is</b> {{paramount}} on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia. In practice this rarely happens. Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, {{both of which are}} headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, a {{judge will}} leave {{office at the}} end of a term, in which case a general {{election}} determines their replacement. If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled position, or a <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior judges are all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} senior Associate <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} to fill any permanent vacancy to {{the seat of the}} Chief Justice, though this tradition was not always observed. Upon the retirement of Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. in 2005, Puno, as the senior Associate <b>Justice,</b> <b>was</b> a leading candidate for appointment as the next Chief Justice. However, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo instead appointed Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban as Chief Justice, marking the first time in 20 years that the senior Associate <b>Justice</b> <b>was</b> bypassed.|$|R
50|$|Idaho Supreme Court: Idaho Supreme Court <b>justices</b> <b>are</b> {{elected in}} nonpartisan {{elections}}.

50|$|The Labour Court has 16 members {{elected by}} the President of Finland for three-year terms, four with a legal training, twelve with a labour market background. The Chief Justice and one Justice of the Labour court are {{full-time}} members with a legal training and without connections to labour market organizations. Two Vice Chief <b>Justices</b> <b>are</b> part-time members, with a legal training and without labour market connections. Four of the lay <b>Justices</b> <b>are</b> nominated by employer organizations, while four lay <b>Justices</b> <b>are</b> nominated by labour unions. The remaining four lay <b>Justices</b> <b>are</b> nominated similarly: Two by the labour market administrations of the State and the municipalities and two by the labour unions of civil servants. All lay Justices serve on part-time basis.|$|R
5|$|One {{justice of}} the court is elected by the court to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The Chief <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> then {{responsible}} for all administration of the Supreme Court. Under a law enacted in 1981 the chief {{is not only the}} titular head of the Supreme Court, but also is {{the chief executive officer of}} the Oregon Judicial Department. In that role the Chief Justice supervises all of the Oregon courts, appoints the Chief Judge of the Oregon Court of Appeals, assigns presiding judges for the trial level state courts, makes court rules, and is in charge of the department’s budget. As administrator the chief is also the recipient of many reports from the court system including non-legal employees of the department. The first Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court was William P. Bryant, while the longest serving chief was Wallace P. Carson, Jr. who held the position for 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|The Department of <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of}} the government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} {{follows a}} two-year Department of Justice investigation, {{prompted by a}} request from Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, {{to determine whether the}} CDP engaged in a pattern or practice of the use of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (1994), 42 U.S.C § 14141 (Section 14141"). Under Section 14141, the Department of <b>Justice</b> <b>is</b> granted authority to seek declaratory or equitable relief to remedy a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or federal law.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
