25|$|In 256 AD, Zeugma {{experienced}} an invasion and {{was destroyed by}} the Sassanid king, Shapur I. The damage from the invasion was so drastic that Zeugma {{was not able to}} recover <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> make the situation even worse, a violent earthquake buried the city beneath rubble. Indeed, during the rest of its time under Roman rule, the city never regained the prosperity it had once achieved.|$|E

25|$|While past cancer {{research}} has involved radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy {{is important to}} study because breakthroughs in treatments for tumor cells will give more options to patients with different conditions. Recent experiments using HeLa cells in {{cancer research}} involves {{the development of new}} photosensitizers with increased ability to be absorbed by cancer cells and still trigger cell death. It is also important that a new photosensitizer does not stay in the body <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prevent unwanted cell damage.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 reform {{introduces}} {{several new}} legal figures: amparo judicial (an injunction), habeas corpus and habeas data.

25|$|Until Continental Airlines began nonstop {{flights to}} Lagos from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in November 2011, many Nigerians {{had to fly}} through Europe to travel between Texas and Nigeria. Jenalia Moreno of the Houston Chronicle said that the Nigerian {{community}} and the energy companies in Houston have worked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get a flight to Nigeria from this city.

In Persian poetry, Mehdi Akhavan Sales {{has established a}} bridge between the Khorassani and Nima Schools. The critics consider Mehdi Akhavan Sales {{as one of the best}} contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of free verse (new style poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics. It was his ambition, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> introduce a fresh style to Persian poetry.|$|E
25|$|The above effects often {{combine to}} cause {{non-linear}} effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption {{refers to the}} inability of a capacitor that has been charged <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, {{it can be as}} much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.|$|E
25|$|He {{was a bit}} late {{coming into}} {{international}} cricket. He was already into his thirties when he first played for the national side. However, having waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get his chance, he was quick to seize the opportunity presented to him. At Faridpur, playing for the Central Zone side, he took 3/24 against the MCC in 1980–81. With Obaidul Haq Azam taking 7/18, the tourists were bundled out for a 79 in their first innings. For Azhar, even bigger success came in three-day match at Rajshahi. By taking 6 wickets for 48 runs, he restricted the MCC side to 255.|$|E

25|$|Laconian pottery {{was known}} since the 19th century from a {{significant}} number of vases from Etruscan graves. At first they were erroneously attributed, being considered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be a product of Cyrene, where some of the earliest pieces were also found. Thanks to British excavations carried out in Sparta’s Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, their true origin was quickly identified. In 1934, Arthur Lane put together all the known material and was the first archaeologist to identify different artists. In 1956 the new discoveries were studied by Brian B. Shefton. He reduced the number of distinct painters by half. In 1958 and 1959 other new material from Taranto was published. A significant number of other vases were also found on Samos. Conrad Michael Stibbe studied anew all 360 vases known to him and published his findings in 1972. He identified five major and three minor painters.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been known <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib {{was found to have}} the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E

But then he became involved with one of the YPSL's and was compelled to seek the counsel of a psychiatrist to explain his unfamiliar feelings.

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for [...] "Fight Club" [...] was a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] that series creator Chris Carter had thought up a while back.

[...] Carter began to write the episode {{at the same time}} as the pilot for the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen. Because of the [...] "insanity" [...] in juggling two scripts at once, many more [...] "crazy" [...] elements made it into [...] "Fight Club". When executive producer Frank Spotnitz first looked at the script, he noted that [...] " [...] had an odd tone. It felt like a wild show." ...|$|E
500|$|Kylie was {{initially}} {{described as having}} a [...] "full on" [...] personality, similar to Becky. She was also labelled a [...] "firecracker". Lane described her as a [...] "messed up girl, dragged up by an alcoholic mother". In her life she had to [...] "fight for survival". Lane has also expressed her admiration of Kylie's [...] "comedy". She has also said Kylie is [...] "quite witty" [...] and amid confrontation is [...] "quick off the mark and won't let someone stamp her down." [...] Viewers of the serial later observed Kylie to be as evil as Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford). Lane said that the comparison was taken too far because Kylie has not murdered anyone, although she acknowledged that Kylie comes across as evil. She also stated: [...] "Kylie will be a thorn in Becky and Steve's sides <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come".|$|E
