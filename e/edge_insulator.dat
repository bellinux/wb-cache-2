40|$|We {{investigate}} the emergence {{and consequences of}} odd-frequency spin-triplet s-wave pairing in superconducting hybrid junctions {{at the edge of}} a two-dimensional topological insulator without any magnetism. More specifically, we consider several different normal-superconductor hybrid systems at the topological <b>insulator</b> <b>edge,</b> where spin-singlet s-wave superconducting pairing is proximity-induced from an external conventional superconductor. We perform fully analytical calculations and show that odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet s-wave pairing arises due to the unique spin-momentum locking in the topological <b>insulator</b> <b>edge</b> state and the naturally non-constant pairing potential profile in hybrid systems. Importantly, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the local density of states (LDOS) at low energies and the odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing in NS, NSN and SNS junctions along the topological insulator edge; at interfaces the enhancement in the LDOS can directly be attributed to the contribution of odd-frequency pairing. Furthermore, in SNS junctions we show that the emergence of the zero-energy LDOS peak at the superconducting phase ϕ=π is associated purely with odd-frequency pairing in the middle of the junction.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{signature of}} Majorana bound {{states is the}} exotic Josephson effects they produce, the classic example being a fractional Josephson current with 4 π periodicity in the phase difference across the junction. Recent work established that topological <b>insulator</b> <b>edges</b> support a novel `magneto-Josephson effect', whereby a dissipationless current exhibits 4 π-periodic dependence also on the relative orientation of the Zeeman fields in the two banks of the junction. Here, we explore the magneto-Josephson effect in junctions based on spin-orbit coupled quantum wires. In contrast to the topological insulator case, the periodicities of the magneto-Josephson effect no longer follow from an exact superconductor-magnetism duality of the Hamiltonian. We employ numerical calculations as well as analytical arguments to identify the domain configurations that display exotic Josephson physics for quantum-wire junctions, and elucidate the characteristic differences with the corresponding setups for topological <b>insulators</b> <b>edges.</b> To provide guidance to experiments, we also estimate {{the magnitude of the}} magneto-Josephson effects in realistic parameter regimes, and compare the Majorana-related contribution to the coexisting 2 π-periodic effects emerging from non-Majorana states.

Our results apply for impurities of arbitrary spin. We show that there exists an energy regime in which the spectrum becomes nearly independent of the flux and significant spectral gaps form.

Experimentally we image the interference patterns on both Bi$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $ and Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ films by measuring the local density of states using a scanning tunneling microscope. The observed decay indices of the standing waves agree excellently with the theoretical prediction: In Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $, only a single decay index of - 3 / 2 exists; while in Bi$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $ with strongly warped surface band, it varies from - 3 / 2 to - 1 / 2 and finally to - 1 as the energy increases. The - 1 / 2 decay indicates that the suppression of backscattering due to time-reversal symmetry does not necessarily lead to a spatial decay rate faster than that in the conventional two-dimensional electron system.

40|$|Progressive epoxy {{debonding}} is {{a common}} factor in many failures of bonded, insulated joints (IJ) in heavy-axle-load railroad service. This paper describes a study in which insulated joints with different amounts of debonding were visually inspected and measured and then disassembled.

Due to some degree of ambiguity in the visual appearance of the interior surfaces, two different criteria for identifying {{the boundaries of the}} debonded region are described and applied. Debonding usually extends farther along the upper and lower portions of the rail / joint-bar interface, resulting in a “V”- or “U”-shaped debonded region.

40|$|In {{this talk}} I will discuss recent {{developments}} in semiclassical theory of spin transport. In particular, I will show how conventional theory of semiclassical transport {{is not able to}} describe spin transport phenomena in which charge currents generate pure spin currents or spin accumulations, namely spin Hall and Edelstein effects. I will then show how to construct a unified semiclassical theory of charge and spin transport in chaotic ballistic and disordered diffusive mesoscopic systems with spin-orbit interaction. Within the unified theory, the random matrix theory prediction that the spin conductance fluctuates universally around zero average, can be produced only by disregarding dynamic effects of spin-orbit interaction. However, these dynamic effects conspire together with geometric Hall correlations to generate finite average spin conductances, thus generating mesoscopic version of the spin Hall and Edelstein effects. The theory, which is confirmed by numerical transport calculations, allows the investigation of the entire range from the weak to the previously unexplored strong spinorbit regime (i. e. the regime in which the spin rotation time is shorter than the momentum relaxation time). I will also discuss how these geometric correlations can be utilized to search for signs of Berry curvature of the underlying band structure in phase coherent transport. As an example I will focus on an n-doped 2 d topological insulator mesoscopic structure, and show how geometric correlations can be utilized to obtain the Berry curvature from the weak spin-localization signal.

40|$|The {{hallmark}} of topological phases is their robust boundary signature whose intriguing properties [...] -such as the one-way transport on the chiral {{edge of a}} Chern insulator and the sudden disappearance of surface states forming open Fermi arcs on the surfaces of Weyl semimetals [...] -are impossible to realize on the surface alone. Yet, despite the glaring simplicity of non-interacting topological bulk Hamiltonians and their concomitant energy spectrum, the detailed study of the corresponding surface states has essentially been restricted to numerical simulation. In this work, however, we show that exact analytical solutions of both topological and trivial surface states can be obtained for generic tight-binding models on a large class of geometrically frustrated lattices in any dimension {{without the need for}} fine-tuning of hopping amplitudes. Our solutions derive from local constraints tantamount to destructive interference between neighboring layer lattices perpendicular to the surface and provide microscopic insights into the structure of the surface states that enable analytical calculation of many desired properties.

40|$|One of the {{defining}} characteristics of topological phases is {{the existence of}} edge and surface states at the boundaries of 2 D and 3 D topological materials. These edge states and surface states are ``topologically protected'', and evade Anderson localization. At {{the edge of a}} 2 D topological <b>insulator</b> (TI), gapless <b>edge</b> states form a spin-momentum-locked 1 D ``helical'' liquid. Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) is often present as long as the inversion symmetry in the material is broken. RSOC enables unconventional impurity and inelastic electron-electron backscatterings. We derive the finite temperature conductivity correction from the most relevant inelastic interaction. At zero temperature, we show that the TI edge remains ballistic even with the combination of RSOC and non-magnetic impurities. In addition, strong inter-particle interactions are allowed for two proximate TI edges due to the RSOC. Such interactions are strictly forbidden for ideal quantum spin Hall <b>insulator</b> <b>edges</b> in the absence of RSOC. We identify a novel low-temperature transport regime which involves the interlocking of the two TI edges, which co-rotate as ``quantum gears.

With respect to the 3 D topological phases, we study the universal properties of the surfaces of the 3 D topological superconductors (TSCs). We demonstrate the Chalker scaling and random matrix statistics in the surface states with weak and strong disorder. We also confirm numerically that the wavefunction multifractality and density of states in certain surface states follow the predictions of conformal field theory, rather than the strong disorder dominated Gade-Wegner fixed point. The multivalley surface state (spin or heat) transport is also investigated. We show that Altshuler-Aronov conductivity corrections always vanish on the multivalley TSC surfaces.

40|$|Bosonic {{excitations}} within long-range ordered, but strongly inhomogeneous phases {{have been}} studied in quite some detail. My thesis focuses instead on understanding the insulating, localized phase of disordered bosonic systems. In particular I study localization properties of strongly interacting bosons and spin systems in a disorder potential at zero temperature. I focus on simple, prototypical spin models (Ising model and XY model) in random fields on a Cayley tree with large connectivity. Regarding {{the nature of the}} quantum phase transition in strong disorder I find the following results: i) With a uniformly distributed disorder non-extensive excitations in the disordered phase are all localized. ii) Moreover, I find that the order arises due to a collective condensation, which is qualitatively distinct from a Bose Einstein condensation of single particle excitations into a delocalized state. In particular, in non-frustrated Bose glasses, I do not find evidence for a boson mobility edge in the Bose glass. These results are qualitatively different from claims in the recent literatures. Considering that (many body) localization of bosons is a kind of quantum glass transition, it is an interesting question to ask what phenomena occur, if the ingredients for more conventional (classical) glassy physics are added to a disordered bosons system, namely: random, frustrated interactions between the bosons. One can still think about such a system as bosons in a disordered potential, where the disordered potential is, at least partly, self-generated by random frustrated interactions between the bosons. This question takes us to the study of another type of disordered systems: glassy systems. Those are typically characterized by low temperature phases with an inhomogeneous density or magnetization pattern, which is extremely long-lived due to the occurrence of non-trivial ergodicity breaking. I study a solvable model of hard core bosons (pseudospins) subject to disorder and frustrating interactions. This solvable model provides insight into the possibility of coexistence of super uidity and glassy density order, as well as into the nature of the coexistence phase (the superglass). In particular, for the considered mean field model I prove the existence of a superglass phase. This complements the numerical evidence for such phases provided by quantum Monte Carlo investigations in finite dimensions and on random graphs. Those were, however, limited to finite temperature, and could thus not fully elucidate the structure of the phases at T = 0. In contrast, my analytical approach allows one to understand the quantum phase transition between glassy superfluid and insulator, and the non-trivial role played by glassy correlations. When the frustrated interactions are strong enough, the superfluid order may be destroyed. As I will show in a mean field model, this happens within the glass phase of the system, where a disorder induced superfluid-insulator phase transition takes place to give way to a frustrated Bose glass. The glassy background on top of which this happens leads to many interesting phenomena which seem not to have been noticed before. To understand the nature of the glassy superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition at zero temperature and the transport properties on the insulating, Bose glass side of the transition is the goal of the third part of my thesis. To address the above questions, I studied an exactly solvable model of a glassy superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition on a Bethe lattice geometry with high connectivity. My main results can be summarized as follows: i) I found that the superfluid-insulator transition is shifted to stronger hopping. This {{is a result of the}} pseudo gap in the density of states of the glass state, which tends to strongly disfavor the onset of superfluidity. ii) In the glassy insulator, the discrete local energy levels become broadened due to the quantum fluctuations. The level-broadening process appears as a phase transition which has strong similarities with an Anderson localization transition, and has implications on many body localization. By using the locator expansion for bosons I found that, the glassy insulator has a finite mobility edge for the bosonic excitations, which, however, does not close upon approaching the SI quantum phase transition point. This finding helps to understand the nature of the superfluid-to-frustrated Bose glass transition: the superfluid emerges as a collective phase ordering phenomenon at zero temperature, and not as a condensation in to a single particle delocalized state, in contrast to opposite predictions in the recent literatures. The existence of a mobility <b>edge</b> in the <b>insulator</b> suggests the possibility of phononless, activated transport in the bosonic insulator, which might be a candidate explanation for the experimentally seen activated transport, which has remained a mystery for a long time...|$|R
