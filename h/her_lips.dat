5|$|As {{the murder}} {{investigation}} unfolds, Skinner tells agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{not to get}} involved. He refuses to take a polygraph test and {{is viewed as a}} suspect. Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examines Sayles' corpse, finding a phosphorescent glow around <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> Mulder finds out that Sayles was a prostitute and interviews her madam, who claims that Skinner's credit card number was collected the previous night.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
25|$|The statue's {{features}} are extremely elaborate as well, and separately cast {{from the rest}} of the bronze statue. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> are made of copper-rose, and part to reveal teeth made of white marble, while her bronze lashes frame eyes made of marble and chestnut irises. However, due to the condition of the irises the statue looks cross-eyed.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a portion}} of the scale which {{differed}} from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.'...out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect—as soon as she opened <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E

25|$|When she {{is found}} in the temple by the priest she is praying silently, but <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> are moving. A priest called Eli {{witnesses}} this odd posture and concludes she is drunk. In her despair she prays to God for a child and if her prayer is granted she will give the son back to God. After Hannah's explanation of her sobriety, Eli blesses her with peace and a guarantee that God of Israel will grant her request. She goes home, eats and drinks with her husband, and is filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah becomes pregnant; her child is named Samuel. The time comes to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple but Hannah stays home. She promises to go to the temple when Samuel is weaned and plans to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arrive at}} Ambrose, which is {{virtually}} a ghost town. Unable {{to find an}} attendant at the gas station, they wander into the church, disrupting a funeral. There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a fan belt after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a wax museum which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. The gas station {{does not have the}} right size fan belt, so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected and covered in molten wax.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Cloud of the Pittsburgh Press gave {{attribution}} to Hershey {{for starting}} a trend {{when she had}} collagen injected into <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{for her role in}} Beaches (1988). Humorist Erma Bombeck said of the movie, which also starred Bette Midler, [...] "I have no idea what Beaches was all about. All I could focus on was Barbara Hershey's lips. She looked like she stopped off at a gas station and someone said, 'Your lips are down 30 pounds. Better let me hit 'em with some air.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "On {{the other}} hand, a goddess of death who {{represents}} the horrors of slaughter and decay is something well known elsewhere; the figure of Kali in India is an outstanding example. Like Snorri's Hel, she is terrifying to in appearance, black or dark in colour, usually naked, adorned with severed heads or arms or the corpses of children, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> smeared with blood. She haunts the battlefield or cremation ground and squats on corpses. Yet for all this she is 'the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees who approach her as their mother' [...]|$|E
500|$|Uma Thurman as Dr. Pamela Isley / Poison Ivy [...] A {{botanist}} {{who becomes}} a crazed eco-terrorist after Woodrue attempts to kill her by pushing her into vials of chemicals, poisons and toxins, which replace her blood with aloe, her skin with chlorophyll and filled <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> with venom, making her kiss deadly. She also uses pheromones which make men {{fall in love with}} her. Julia Roberts, who worked with director Joel Schumacher in Flatliners, was heavily rumored to be in contention for the role, but the rumours were dismissed by Schumacher, saying that if she would have wanted to get the role, she would have called him.|$|E
500|$|Girl with Ball {{depicts a}} woman wearing a bathing suit holding a beach ball with red stripes in {{the same color as}} <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and tongue. Lichtenstein used a painter's version of comic strip artist {{techniques}} to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using Ben-Day dots of primary colors. The process is described as exaggerating the [...] "limitations of mechanical reproduction" [...] to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking. Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using [...] "commercial shorthand".|$|E

500|$|In the 1960 election, Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States against Democratic {{opponent}} Senator John F. Kennedy. Pat {{was featured}} {{prominently in the}} campaign; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan [...] "Pat for First Lady". Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined. Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost—"millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes", as one reporter put it. This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest on his radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Rihanna revealed that she found [...] "You da One" [...] to be a highly addictive to listen to after she heard the final cut, saying You da One' {{is one of those}} records that became very addictive for me. I could not stop listening to this song. It's very infectious." [...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back and her eyes closed holding a cigarette between <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> It prompted a mixed reaction from Sarah Anne Hughes for The Washington Post; while she noted that Rihanna looks [...] "perfectly coiffed," [...] she criticized the inclusion of the cigarette, and called it a [...] "social taboo." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen said he found it [...] "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} of the song was Madonna's attempt to embrace and accept her mother's death. Directed by David Fincher and shot in black-and-white, it shows a little girl playing in the snow, as her mother dies. A grown-up Madonna follows the child and sings the song, as the child runs away from her abusive father. Described by reviewers as [...] "autobiographical", the video was listed by Rolling Stone as one of [...] "The 100 Top Music Videos". Scholars noted how Madonna's persona was split into the child and adult in the video, and one writer {{described}} a scene involving the dead mother shown in her wake, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> sewn shut, {{as one of the}} most disturbing scenes in the history of mainstream music videos—the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother from her funeral. [...] "Oh Father" [...] was performed only on the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, where Madonna portrayed a woman trying to find her religion and her battle for it.|$|E
500|$|Jerry dares Elaine {{to take an}} egg roll from someone's {{plate and}} eat it, {{offering}} her [...] "fifty bucks" [...] to do so. Elaine approaches a table with an elderly couple and tells them that her friend will give her $50 to eat one of their egg rolls, and she is willing to give them $25 of it. As she softly speaks the offer without moving <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> they fail to comprehend her. She awkwardly walks away, then laughs off her attempt. George is finally able to call Tatiana, but he gets the answering machine, so he leaves a message. Tatiana calls the restaurant to reach George, but the maître d' calls [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza", and she [...] "said curse word" [...] {{when he told her}} that George is not there. When the mysterious woman encounters Jerry, he remembers belatedly that she is his uncle's receptionist and becomes upset knowing that she'll tell his uncle, who then will tell his parents and so on.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up {{to a bunch of}} lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, like, really cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features a lot of people (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 bouncing around and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E
