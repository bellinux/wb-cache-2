50|$|The {{software}} that eventually became CT Connect was originally {{developed in the}} late 1980s at Digital Equipment Corporation. During the 1980s, telephony was evolving from analog to digital technology. The international telecommunications standards body CCITT (now the ITU) published specifications for the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). The <b>ISDN</b> <b>specifications</b> define digital interfaces between a subscriber and the network that can simultaneously support multiple telephone calls and packet data transmission.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s Digital Equipment was {{a leader}} in {{computer}} networking with its DECnet software. Digital Equipment studied the <b>ISDN</b> <b>specifications</b> {{and concluded that the}} ISDN interface lacked the ability to coordinate a voice call with related data. The Digital Equipment team named this capability computer integrated telephony (or CIT) and evangelized the concept among vendors and customers. (The acronym for the original Digital Equipment product line, CIT, is frequently confused with the industry acronym for any form of computer-telephone integration, CTI. The latter term was adopted by members of the MultiMedia Telecommunications Association (MMTA), a prominent US industry association. The MMTA was incorporated into a larger trade association, TIA, in 2000.) ...|$|E
50|$|The 1980s saw the {{development}} of techniques for broadband communications that allowed the limit to be greatly extended. A patent was filed in 1979 {{for the use of}} existing telephone wires for both telephones and data terminals that were connected to a remote computer via a digital data carrier system. The motivation for digital subscriber line technology was the Integrated Services Digital Network (<b>ISDN)</b> <b>specification</b> proposed in 1984 by the CCITT (now ITU-T) as part of Recommendation I.120, later reused as ISDN digital subscriber line (IDSL). Employees at Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) developed asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) by placing wide-band digital signals above the existing baseband analog voice signal carried between telephone company telephone exchanges and customers on conventional twisted pair cabling facilities, and filed a patent in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Primarily CAPI was {{designed}} for data transfer over <b>ISDN.</b> The <b>specification</b> has been extended multiple times, thereby it became important {{to the area of}} voice- and fax-communication. Because pure data transfer over IP-based networks is dominant in modern times, CAPI is being used primarily in the scope of voice applications (voice mail, IVR, call-center, voice conference systems etc.), for fax-servers and combined systems (UMS).|$|R
50|$|Motorola 68302 Integrated Multiprotocol Processor {{featured}} a RISC processor controlled either by a microcode in ROM or by downloadable firmware. Various forms of microcode were shipped for different applications, for example to support Signaling System 7 communications or Centronics parallel interface. Motorola 68360 QUICC {{was the first}} design to feature Communications Processor Module, offering microcode for SS7 and <b>ISDN</b> applications. <b>Specifications</b> of the microcontroller programming interface were generally not shipped to customers. It was possible to run 68360 in slave mode and to use only CPM part of the chip, for example in the M68360QUADS-040 board, where 68040 CPU (master) is coupled with 68360 CPM (slave), with CPU of 68360 processor being disabled.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{some of the}} evolving commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and potential difficulties in implementing the proposed Defense Information System Network (DSIN) based on Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) compliance and Integrated Services digital Network (ISDN) conformance testing. It starts by examining the MILDEPs Command, Control and Communications (C 3) network architectures by providing brief descriptions of the various standards. Not only does it examine such technologies as Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), Fast Packet Switching (FPS), and Broadband ISDN, but it also highlights some of the ISDN conformance test suites with a view toward migrating these architectures and technologies to the DISN. Results indicate that incompatibilities between C 3 networks will be impacted more in the DISN near term and transition phases than in the far term. This {{is due in part}} to embedded proprietary functions permeating COTS products and the lack of fully developed <b>ISDN</b> conformance test <b>specifications.</b> The lack of clearly defined standards is a major cause of proprietary implementations. Coupled with the limited availability of ISDN conformance test suites to test multi-vendored MILDEP networks, this will make deployment of the DISN a challenge. Recommendations for further research are also presented. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R
