40|$|This {{contribution}} {{looks at}} two {{trends in the}} evolution of Czech diglossia over the past hundred years that can be described as the ‘dismantling’ and ‘dissolution’ of the diglossic language situation. Dismantling concerns official attempts to reach a ‘rapprochement’ between H and L by modifying the prescribed description of H to incorporate elements from L. Dissolution concerns unofficial changes resulting from societal upheaval and technological advances that have caused a blurring between public and private space and between the formal and informal spheres. The evident retreat of the <b>H</b> <b>code,</b> ‘Literary Czech,’ calls into question the extent to which Ferguson’s classic definitions still apply in the Czech lands. Official changes have attempted to maintain the functionality and prestige of H, but have frequently merely enriched H with previously proscribed features of the dominant L code, ‘Common Czech. ’ Unofficial changes have seen L expand into domains that were previously the exclusive preserve of H. Attitudes characteristic of diglossic language situations continue to sustain the distinction, while the actual functional uses of the two varieties has already departed substantially from a diglossic language situation...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} transcriptional and epigenetic mechanism(s) behind diminished {{skeletal muscle}} GLUT 4 mRNA in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) female rat offspring. An increase in MEF 2 D (inhibitor) with {{a decline in}} MEF 2 A (activator) and MyoD (co-activator) binding to the glut 4 promoter in IUGR versus control was observed. The functional role of MEF 2 /MyoD-binding sites and neighboring three CpG clusters in glut 4 gene transcription was confirmed in C 2 C 12 muscle cells. No differential methylation of these three and other CpG clusters in the glut 4 promoter occurred. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT 1) in postnatal, DNMT 3 a, and DNMT 3 b in adult was differentially recruited with increased MeCP 2 (methyl CpG-binding protein) concentrations to bind the IUGR glut 4 gene. Covalent modifications of the histone (<b>H)</b> <b>code</b> consisted of H 3. K 14 de-acetylation by recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and enhanced association of HDAC 4 enzymes. This {{set the stage for}} Suv 39 H 1 methylase-mediated di-methylation of H 3. K 9 and increased recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 α, which partially inactivates postnatal and adult IUGR glut 4 gene transcription. Further increased interactions in the adult IUGR between DNMT 3 a/DNMT 3 b and HDAC 1 and MEF 2 D and HDAC 1 /HDAC 4 and decreased association between MyoD and MEF 2 A existed. We conclude that epigenetic mechanisms consisting of histone code modifications repress skeletal muscle glut 4 transcription in the postnatal period and persist in the adult female IUGR offspring...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the pragmatics of codeswitching from FuSHa Arabic, the high variety of Arabic (FA), to Aammiyyah Arabic, the low variety or vernacular (AmA), in the most formal type of discourse, namely religious-oriented discourse. The study posited the following five hypotheses: 1) CS occurs with considerable frequency in religious discourse; 2) these switches are communicatively purposeful; 3) frequency of CS {{is related to the}} linguistic make-up of the audience addressed, 4) to the AmA of the speaker, and 5) to the section of the discourse delivered. To carry out the investigation, the researcher analyzed 18 audio and videotapes of religious discourse, delivered by 13 Arabic religious scholars from different Arab countries. Ten of these tapes were used exclusively to show that CS occurs in religious discourse. The other eight tapes were used to investigate the other hypotheses. The eight tapes involved presentations by three of the most famous religious scholars (from Egypt, Kuwait, and Yemen) delivered 1) within their home countries and 2) outside their home countries. Three of the five hypotheses were supported. It was found that: CS from FA to AmA occurred in religious discourse with considerable frequency; these switches served pragmatic purposes; and the frequency of the switches higher in the question/answer sections than in the lecture sections. Analysis showed that codeswitches fell into three categories: iconic/rhetorical, structural, and other. The switches served numerous communicative functions, some of which resemble the functions found in CS in conversational discourse. One finding was the relationship between the content of the message and the attitude of the speaker toward or its source. Generally, what the speakers perceived as [+positive] was expressed by the <b>H</b> <b>code,</b> and whatever they perceived as [-positive] was expressed by the L code. Scrutiny of this exploitation of the two codes indicated that FA tended to be utilized as a means of upgrading, whereas AmA was used as a means of downgrading. Department of EnglishThesis (Ph.

40|$|Due to the {{teaching}} and learning accountabilities that guide the evaluation process of public school principals, it is essential to examine whether early college education is a factor in academic achievement, student behavior, and school climate. It is equally important to determine whether early college education influence students decision to continue their college experience after high school graduation. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine selected North Carolina principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of early college education in relation to student behavior, academic achievement, and school climate. Principals were also asked to give their perceptions of the impact early college education has on graduation and post-secondary opportunities. ^ The six principals involved in this study possessed a passion for education and expressed a passion for teaching and learning. Principals freely shared their perceptions on academic achievement, school climate, and student behavior in early colleges. Based on their responses the following recurring 16 themes emerged: (a) professional development, (b) college readiness, (c) distractions, (d) teacher collaboration, (e) academic tracking, (f) sense of competition, (g) academic behavior (<b>h)</b> <b>code</b> of conduct, (i) peer intervention, (j) values (k) family atmosphere, (1) leadership, (m) community outreach, (n) college readiness, (o) academic incentives, and (p) student satisfaction.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how language attitudes affect linguistic stratification {{and language}} use among Moroccan youth. The language situation in urban Morocco offers a unique venue for exploring how different linguistic codes, be they exogenous or endogenous, are represented and seek legitimacy and presence in contested and negotiated social domains. This dissertation brings a current understanding of language practices among youth in Morocco {{and contributes to}} a broader understanding of the sociolinguistic situation in Morocco and in the Arab world. Focus group participants use different discursive strategies to contest or rationalize the hegemonic discourse of modernity that shapes and is shaped by their language attitudes that they project toward different languages in Morocco. Studies on language attitudes have traditionally argued for aligning languages through covert and overt prestige, where local languages represent aspects of local culture, while the outward projection of social mobility motivates the acquisition {{and use of the}} transplanted varieties (Labov 1972; Trudgill 1983; Bentahila 1983; Marley 2004). Using a matched guise test, this dissertation broadens the scope of sociolinguistic research to analyze the covert language attitudes that shape the presence of H codes (Standard Arabic and French) and an L code (Moroccan Arabic). This analysis of covert attitudes shows that these languages are not uniformly distributed along the poles of status and solidarity but rather are competing for both. In addition to the investigation of language attitudes using critical discourse analysis and two matched guise tests, this dissertation contributes to the theoretical understanding of sociolinguistic research in Morocco by analyzing an overt language attitudes questionnaire. The main theoretical focus of the questionnaire provides us with an understanding of overt language attitudes, analyzed using diglossia and socioeconomic class stratifications, as well as reported language use, analyzed intergenerationally and by socioeconomic class. In spite of the maintenance of diglossia between local languages, namely Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, and Berber, these results show how French and MA-French codeswitching permeate into lower functional domains, which undermine the presence of local languages. The results of this dissertation show that different data methods produce different results; therefore, the theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that more than one method of data collection must be used in order to validate a theory and more than one method of data analysis must be investigated before making any theoretical claims. The second theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that L codes do not hold exclusive appropriation to L domains. While MA and Berber in L domains are maintained through diglossia, which prevents the <b>H</b> <b>code</b> of SA from entering these domains, French has started to negotiate its presence in these L domains. This dissertation challenges the theoretical assumption that allocates H codes to the projection of overt prestige and L codes solely to solidarity, by testing covert attitudes within a pilot Matched Guise Test between SA and French, two H codes, and then adding the L code of MA to further test the relationship between the L and H codes in terms of status and solidarity. The empirical results of this dissertation challenge the conceptual understanding of language attitudes in Morocco and show a stratified outlook of these attitudes, divided along socioeconomic class lines. Thus, using data from Matched Guise Tests, a language attitudes questionnaire, and a focus group, this study reanalyzes the motivations behind the current attitudinal distribution toward different languages in Morocco, as well as the functional stratification these codes in various social domains...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) <b>H.</b> 263 video <b>coding</b> standard, real-time visual communications over low-bandwidth, low-error-rate wired telephone networks is now possible. Unfortunately, {{because of the nature of}} the algorithms employed within this compression standard and due to the inherent limitations of the radio environment, <b>H.</b> 263 <b>coded</b> video performs poorly when employed over bandwidth-limited, error-prone wireless channels. In this paper we propose an intuitive, low-complexity, pre-compression scheme that improves the performance of <b>H.</b> 263 <b>coded</b> video over radio channels. In our scheme video frames are spatially segmented into regions of different perceptual importance before being compressed independently with the H. 263 encoder. This allows us to apply unequal error protection and prioritized transmission to achieve at least a minimum temporal resolution at the receiver. Additionally, with this technique, both spatial and temporal error propagation is limited and through intra-frame statistical multiplexing the reserved transmission bandwidth is utilized optimally. Simulation results demonstrate that in the presence of severe error conditions and severe bandwidth constraints, our modified H. 263 video codec exhibits better error concealment, better temporal resolution, and better bandwidth utilization properties than the original H. 263 video codec 1 1...|$|R
