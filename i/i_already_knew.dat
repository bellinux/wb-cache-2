I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

On February 1, 2008, Goodell stated that the tapes were destroyed because [...] "they confirmed what <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> about the issue."

We were unpacking stuff from the car and moving into No 28. <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> Alan, but I didn't know the kids. It all just meshed, though, and we knew immediately what type of family {{we were going to}} be." [...] Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school and Karl became the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters. In 1995, Rainey Mayo portrayed a teenage Susan in a daydream. In October 2009, Woodburne became the longest-serving actress in the show's history, having appeared on-screen as Susan for fifteen years. Of her television milestone, Woodburne said, [...] "It seems both bizarre and wonderful to me that I'm coming up to 15 years on the show, even though the world of Neighbours feels instinctive and familiar, I'm still challenged and rewarded by the work." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was frightening to contemplate. ... <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For {{the first time since the}} accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{anthology}} as a [...] "flawless jewel of science fiction", Shaenon K. Garrity {{called it an}} emotional work which touched her deeply: [...] "Because of A, A Prime, I discovered that this art form could do more than I'd imagined—not just tell ambitious stories, which <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> from reading Sandman and Bone and Watchmen, but tell them with passion, in lines drawn from nerve endings, using every weapon in the artist's arsenal to not just dazzle the mind, but stab straight to the heart." [...] Katherine Dacey also praised the [...] "intensely Romantic quality of all three stories" [...] and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with [...] "symbolically rich imagery" [...] and a [...] "dream-like quality". Dacey cited Hagio's [...] "unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.|$|E

2500|$|His first work as {{writer and}} {{director}} was Norberto's Deadline (2010), about a shy and unemployed salesman named Norberto who start to study acting to gain confidence on himself. As screenwriter, he had previously collaborated on the script for Daniel Burman's El nido vacío (2008). The film was filmed in Uruguay and produced by both countries from the Río de la Plata, [...] "The crew that I chose is my 'dream team'; it's the people I dreamed to work with, beyond nationality, and ended up being a very mixed team, a mixture from Uruguay and Argentina," [...] said Hendler. He had never studied filmmaking before, he says, [...] "Many times {{we begin with the}} assumption that the problem of film is on the technical knowledge, but the technical rules are the quickest to learn and the least you use. Experience in the use of certain resources is what gives you the possible solutions or shortcuts at the time of transporting to the screen what you imagined. The more knowledge you have, the easier you reach it, but 'the truths' about cinematic technique are the easiest to solve as a director. There were things <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> how to do, and some others I didn't, and depend on what you're looking in each movie." [...] By 2003, Hendler had started writing an ensamble story called [...] "The Day Ends at 10," [...] he dismissed the story but the characters were kept for another ensemble film, [...] "The Move", which included a character named Norberto, a role that started to have more and more prominence, until the story finally became Norberto's Deadline.|$|E

60|$|Rummaging {{through this}} same dusty book-case, I found {{in one of}} the ill- fitting drawers, beneath a heap of torn and tumbled books, a diary {{belonging}} to the fifties, stuffed with many letters and shapeless flowers, pressed between stained pages; and there--for the writer of stories, tempted by human documents, is weak--in faded ink, brown and withered like the flowers, I read the story <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the more}} purely {{technical}} {{part of my}} education was being steadily persevered in; and so I was not surprised, although it was rather a blow to me, when the clergyman who had been my tutor walked home with me through the wood one summer evening, and told my mother that it was useless my going to him any longer, for <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> all that he could teach me.|$|E

60|$|His special {{interest}} was the fauna of Australasia, and {{his knowledge of}} the matter was as exhaustive as it was accurate. <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> a good deal about the rabbits in Australasia and their marvelous fecundity, but in my talks with him I found that my estimate of the great hindrance and obstruction inflicted by the rabbit pest upon traffic and travel was far short of the facts.

60|$|Now from round {{this turn}} {{appeared}} the strangest sight that I think my eyes had ever seen. Yes, there came the huge elephant, Jana, at a slow, shambling trot.

Round the brute's neck were a number of bright metal chains, twelve in all, and each of these chains was held by a spearman who ran alongside, six on one side and six on the other. Lastly, ingeniously fastened {{to the end of his}} trunk were three other chains to which were attached spiked knobs of metal.|$|E

I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver's seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.|$|E
