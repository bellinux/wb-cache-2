White- nose fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) is causing an epizootic in bats that is expanding rapidly, both geographically and taxonomically. Little is known of the ecology and distributional potential of this intercontinental pathogen. We address this gap via ecological niche models that characterise coarse resolution niche differences between <b>fungus</b> <b>populations</b> on dif- ferent continents, identifying areas potentially vulnerable to infection in South America. Here we explore a novel approach to identifying areas of potential distribution across novel geographic regions that avoids perilious extrapolation into novel environments. European and North American <b>fungus</b> <b>populations</b> show differential use of environmental space, but rather than niche differentiation, we find that changes are best attributed to climatic differences between the two continents. Suitable areas for spread of the pathogen were identified across southern South America; however caution should be taken to avoid underestimating the potential for spread of this pathogen in South America...|$|R

To do so, an experiment was installed at the green house, in the Forest Nursery of UFSM, using an experimental design completely randomized factorial 4 x 3 x 4 (Factor F: Fusarium spp. inoculation; Factor C: soil limestone; Factor A: NPK doses), totaling 48 treatments. The seedlings were cultivated in vases containing 2 kg of soil, classified as ‘Red-Yellow Argisoil’ (clay soil).

Metal-amended antroposol type soil samples were incubated {{for a month}} at 17 °C under natural light regime. Copper, zinc and lead were chosen as the most common industrial pollutants. Each metal was applied either of sulfate, chloride or acetate salt (at concentration varying from 0. 4 to 16. 14 g kg- 1 soil); control – soil without metal amendment. Fungal populations (dilution plate method) were investigated and soil phytotoxicity test was performed. Elevated Cu, Zn and Pb concentrations in the soil influenced fungus community structure. Some species (Absidia glauca, Acremonium kiliense, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Alternaria alternata) detected in the control soil community were eliminated, while the abundance of the other species increased. Paecillomyces genus dominated in the soil amended with either of Cu or Zn. P. farinosus, P. fumosoroseum and fungal species from the Clonostachys, Penicillium and Lecanicillium genera were Znresistant. P. lilacinus and plant pathogenic fungi, A. alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani and Phoma lingam were very abundant in soil amended with Cu salts, followed by some saprotrophic fungi such as Cunninghamella echinulata and Mucor hiemalis f. hiemalis. An overall change in the plant (cress, Lepidum sativum; wheat, Ticicum aestivum; lupine, Lupinus polyphyllus, and sunflower, Heliannthus annus) seed viability was observed in comparison with control.

The rise in temperature has increased evaporation in certain forest environments that as a result has promoted cloud formation.

The combination of decreased daytime temperature and increased nighttime temperatures may be providing optimal growth and reproduction for Chytrid fungus which has preferred temperature range between 63° and 77 °F (17° and 25 °C).

40|$|Heterotrophic {{micro-organisms}} {{were studied}} on three Hawaiian beaches-two of volcanic origin {{and one of}} carbonate. The volcanic beaches consisted of coarse particles with little organic matter. The carbonate beach consisted of coarse-to-fine, light-colored particles and contained more organic material than the volcanic sands. <b>Fungi</b> <b>populations</b> of the three beaches differed noticeably in their tolerance to temperature, salinity, and pH. In vitro testing of selected fungi showed wide tolerance to salinity levels, less tolerance to the high temperature of black sand, and no adaptation to alkaline pH levels. Heterotrophic microbe populations were greatest in the supratidal zone, except for the intertidal bacterial population of the black sand beach. In the subtidal black zone of the carbonate beach, only bacteria were well established, actinomycetes were absent, and fungi were few. Fifty percent of the fungi were common to any {{two of the three}} beaches. Zonal decrease in numbers at all three beaches was attributed to differences in submergence time...|$|R
40|$|Saprophytic and facultative {{parasitic}} fungi {{present in}} the coastal waters and adjacent pelagic areas of the Hawaiian Islands, and in coastal sands of the Hawaiian, Line, and Phoenix islands, were isolated by plating methods. Isolates from all areas sampled indicate that abundant and varied <b>fungus</b> <b>populations</b> do exist in these environments. The number of fungi obtained from the inshore neritic zone was seven times that obtained from the oceanic zone. The fungus Aureobasidium pullulans (De Bary) Arnaud was isolated repeatedly from oceanic waters. A comparison is made between the genera and {{the average number of}} isolates per liter of water known from the Atlantic Ocean with those found in this study of the Pacific Ocean. The number of fungi isolated from sand samples of the different islands ranged from 2 to 1, 600 per gram. Species diversity was evident throughout the samples. The leeward Hawaiian islands had a higher average number of isolates per gram than any other island group. In conclusion the problems of defining a marine fungus are discussed...|$|R
