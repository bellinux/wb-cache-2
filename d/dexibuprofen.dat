50|$|<b>Dexibuprofen</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is {{the active}} dextrorotatory enantiomer of ibuprofen. Most ibuprofen formulations contain a racemic mixture of both isomers.|$|E
50|$|Ibuprofen and {{ketoprofen}} are {{now available}} in single, active enantiomer preparations (<b>dexibuprofen</b> and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. Naproxen has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{optically}} active compound {{with both}} S and R-isomers, {{of which the}} S (dextrorotatory) isomer is the more biologically active; this isomer has also been isolated and used medically (see <b>dexibuprofen</b> for details).|$|E
50|$|Hydroformylation of {{prochiral}} alkenes creates new stereocenters. Using chiral phosphine ligands, the hydroformylation can {{be tailored}} to favor one enantiomer. Thus, for example, <b>Dexibuprofen,</b> the (+)−(s)-enantiomer of Ibuprofen, can be produced by enantioselective hydroformylation followed by oxidation.|$|E
50|$|Ibuprofen is {{produced}} industrially as a racemate. The compound, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives (including ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen, etc.), does contain a chiral {{center in the}} α-position of the propionate moiety. So two enantiomers of ibuprofen occur, {{with the potential for}} different biological effects and metabolism for each enantiomer. Indeed, the (S)-(+)-ibuprofen (<b>dexibuprofen)</b> was found to be the active form both in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
40|$|Dexibuprofen–antioxidant conjugates were {{synthesized}} {{with the}} aim to reduce its gastrointestinal effects. The esters analogs of <b>dexibuprofen</b> 5 a–c were obtained by reacting its –COOH group with chloroacetyl derivatives 3 a–c. The in vitro hydrolysis data confirmed that synthesized prodrugs 5 a–c were stable in stomach while undergo significant hydrolysis in 80 % human plasma and thus release free <b>dexibuprofen.</b> The minimum reversion was observed at pH 1. 2 suggesting that prodrugs are less irritating to stomach than <b>dexibuprofen.</b> The anti-inflammatory activity of 5 c (p < 0. 001) is more significant than the parent <b>dexibuprofen.</b> The prodrug 5 c produced maximum inhibition (42. 06 %) of paw-edema against egg-albumin induced inflammation in mice. Anti-pyretic effects in mice indicated that prodrugs 5 a and 5 b showed significant inhibition of pyrexia (p < 0. 001). The analgesic activity of 5 a is more pronounced compared to other synthesized prodrugs. The mean percent inhibition indicated that the prodrug 5 a was more active in decreasing the number of writhes induced by acetic acid than standard <b>dexibuprofen.</b> The ulcerogenic activity results assured that synthesized prodrugs produce less gastrointestinal adverse effects than <b>dexibuprofen.</b> The ex vivo antiplatelet aggregation activity results also confirmed that synthesized prodrugs are less irritant to gastrointestinal mucosa than the parent <b>dexibuprofen.</b> Molecular docking analysis showed that the prodrugs 5 a–c interacts with the residues present in active binding sites of target protein. The stability of drug–target complexes is verified by molecular dynamic simulation study. It exhibited that synthesized prodrugs formed stable complexes with the COX- 2 protein thus support our wet lab results. It is therefore concluded that the synthesized prodrugs have promising pharmacological activities with reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects than the parent drug...|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIAnimal {{models are}} used to {{research}} the mechanisms of pain and tomimic human pain. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the degree of interaction between dexketoprofen and <b>dexibuprofen,</b> by isobolographic analysis using the formalin orofacial assay in mice. This assay presents two-phase time course: an early short-lasting, phase I, starting immediately after the formalin injection producing a tonic acute pain, leaving a 15 min quiescent period, followed by a prolonged, phase II, after the formalin and representing inflammatory pain. Administration of dexketoprofen or <b>dexibuprofen</b> produced a dose-dependent antinociception, with different potency, either during phases I or II. The co-administration of dexketoprofen and <b>dexibuprofen</b> produced synergism in phase I and II. In conclusion, both dexketoprofen and <b>dexibuprofen</b> are able to induce antinociception in the orofacial formalin assay. Their co-administration produced a synergism, which could be related to the different degree of COX inhibition and other mechanisms of analgesics...|$|E

Nanospheres exhibited a mean particle size around 200 nm (195. 4 nm), monomodal population and negative surface charge. Drug loaded nanospheres showed a sustained release profile, allowing to modify the posology in vivo. Nanospheres were non-toxic neither in brain endothelial cells nor astrocytes and do not cause blood–brain barrier disruption.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{review is}} an update of a {{previously}} published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 3, 2009 on single dose oral <b>dexibuprofen</b> (S(+) -ibuprofen) for acute postoperative pain in adults. <b>Dexibuprofen</b> is a {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) licensed for use in rheumatic disease and other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK, and widely available in other countries worldwide. It is an active isomer of ibuprofen. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>dexibuprofen</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies in patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over four to six hours, using standard methods. This type of study {{has been used for}} many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of single dose oral <b>dexibuprofen</b> for acute postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised studies using almost identical methods and outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: Searches were run for the original review in 2009 and subsequent searches have been run in August 2013. We did not find any new published studies {{as a result of the}} updated search. We searched for randomised studies of <b>dexibuprofen</b> in acute postoperative pain in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (The Cochrane LIbrary), and for clinical trial reports and synopses of published and unpublished studies from Internet sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of oral <b>dexibuprofen</b> for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We extracted pain relief or pain intensity data and converted it into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over four to six hours, from which relative risk and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. We collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. MAIN RESULTS: New data were identified for this update in one unpublished trial synopsis (BR 1160 1995) in addition to the single study (Dionne 1998) that was included in the original review. In both studies <b>dexibuprofen</b> gave high levels of response, with 51 / 96 (53 %) participants experiencing at least 50 % pain relief with <b>dexibuprofen</b> 200 mg and 35 / 50 (70 %) with <b>dexibuprofen</b> 400 mg, compared with 75 / 147 (51 %) with racemic ibuprofen 400 mg, and 12 / 62 (13 %) with placebo. The numbers of participants was too small to calculate NNTs with any meaning. The median time to additional analgesic use was greater than four hours for all active therapies, but about two hours for placebo. Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate intensity and consistent with events normally associated with anaesthesia and surgery. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Additional data did not alter the conclusions from the earlier review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The information from these two studies in acute postoperative pain suggested that <b>dexibuprofen</b> may be a useful analgesic, but at doses not very different from racemic ibuprofen, for which considerably more evidence exists...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aims of {{this study}} were to develop {{liposome}} enriched <b>Dexibuprofen</b> liposomal hydrogels for topical delivery, perform in vitro release studies and in vivo permeation studies through mice/rat skin, and evaluate the efficacy of liposomal gels against inflammation induced rats. The purpose was to provide the delivery of the topical drug at a sustained rate across intact skin to improve bioavailability and inflammation control for longer period from liposomal gels. Method: Phosphatidylcholine, Cholesterol and <b>Dexibuprofen</b> were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) mixture and subsequently transferred into a pear-shaped flask connected to a Rotavapor (Büchi- type). Rotary evaporation method was used for the formulation of liposomes. Result: liposome prepared was evaluated for particle size measurement, percent drug entrapment, diffusion study, skin permeation study and in vivo study. F- 7 batch found to be optimized batch having particle size 5. 40 µm, % drug entrapment 61. 70, % CDR 75. 35 %. Hence F- 7 batch further evaluated for skin permeation study, skin deposition study, in vivo study and stability study. Conclusion: The present study has been a satisfactory attempt to formulate and evaluate liposome of <b>Dexibuprofen</b> and liposomal gel with a providing sustained delivery of drug. From skin permeation study and in vivo study it was concluded that the prepared liposome of <b>Dexibuprofen</b> may prove to be potential candidate for safe and effective sustained drug delivery {{over an extended period of}} time which can reduce dosing frequency...|$|E

A total of 135 participants completed the study. Treatment with the multi-ingredient formula (Lipicur) reduced neuropathic pain by more than 66 % in both conditions (subjects with lumbar sciatica and with carpal tunnel syndrome), and these reductions were statistically significant. Moreover, the treatment reduced <b>dexibuprofen</b> use by about 40 %. An add-on therapy with only lipoic acid has not shown any significant results.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop a reservoir-type transdermal patch for a {{controlled}} delivery of <b>dexibuprofen</b> and to evaluate its in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in Albino Wistar rats. In order to develop these patches, six formulations of <b>dexibuprofen</b> microemulsion comprising ethyl oleate, Tween 80 : PG (2 [*]:[*] 1), and water were prepared by simplex lattice design and characterized. The reservoir compartment was filled with these microemulsions and in vitro release and skin permeation were assessed. The optimized patch was obtained on the basis of the responses: Q 24 and flux. The impact of drug loading, surface area, membrane thickness, adhesive, and agitation speed on drug release and permeation was also studied. The skin sensitivity reaction and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of optimized patch were evaluated. Stability study at three different temperatures for three months was carried out. The result suggests that a membrane based patch with zero-order release rate, Q 24 of 79. 13 ± 3. 08 %, and maximum flux of 331. 17 [*]µg/cm 2 h can be obtained exhibiting suitable anti-inflammatory activity with no visible skin sensitivity reaction. The outcomes of stability study recommend storage of patches at 4 °C having shelf-life of 6. 14 months.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling {{has emerged as}} a major tool in clinical pharmacology to optimize drug use by designing rational dosage forms and dosage regimes. Quantitative representation of the dose-concentration-response relationship should provide information for the prediction of the level of response to a certain level of drug dose. This paper describes the experimental details of the preformulation study, tablet manufacture, optimization, and bioanalytical methods for the estimation of <b>dexibuprofen</b> in human plasma. The hydrophilic matrix was prepared with xanthen gum with additives Avicel PH 102. The effect of the concentration of the polymer and different filler, on the in vitro drug release, was studied. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC 0 –t, AUC 0 –∞, Cmax, Tmax, T 1 / 2, and elimination rate constant (Kel) were determined from the plasma concentration of both formulations of test (<b>dexibuprofen</b> 300 mg) and reference (<b>dexibuprofen</b> 300 mg tablets). The merits of PK-PD in the development of dosage forms and how PK-PD model development necessitates the development of new drugs and bio analytical method development and validation are discussed.

DXI treatment reduced the activation of glial cells and the cytokine release involved in the neurodegenerative process, especially TNFα. Moreover, DXI reduced soluble β-amyloid (Aβ 1 - 42) plaque deposition by decreasing APP, BACE 1 and facilitating Aβ degradation by enhancing insulin-degrading enzyme. DXI also decreased TAU hyperphosphorylation inhibiting c-Abl/CABLES/p-CDK 5 activation signal pathway and prevented spatial learning and memory impairment in transgenic mice.

40|$|The high-affinity IgE {{receptor}} (Fcε RI) is a heterotetramer {{of three}} subunits: Fcε RIα, Fcε RIβ and Fcε RIγ (αβγ 2) encoded by three genes designated as FCER 1 A, FCER 1 B (MS 4 A 2) and FCER 1 G, respectively. Recent {{evidence points to}} FCERI gene variability as a relevant factor {{in the risk of}} developing allergic diseases. Because Fcε RI {{plays a key role in}} the events downstream of the triggering factors in immunological response, we hypothesized that FCERI gene variants might be related with the risk of, or with the clinical response to, selective (IgE mediated) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) hypersensitivity. From a cohort of 314 patients suffering from selective hypersensitivity to metamizole, ibuprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), propifenazone, naproxen, ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, etofenamate, aceclofenac, etoricoxib, <b>dexibuprofen,</b> indomethacin, oxyphenylbutazone or piroxicam, and 585 unrelated healthy controls that tolerated these NSAIDs, we analyzed the putative effects of the FCERI SNPs FCER 1 A rs 2494262, rs 2427837 and rs 2251746; FCER 1 B rs 1441586, rs 569108 and rs 512555; FCER 1 G rs 11587213, rs 2070901 and rs 11421. Furthermore, in order to identify additional genetic markers which might be associated with the risk of developing selective NSAID hypersensitivity, or which may modify the putative association of FCERI gene variations with risk, we analyzed polymorphisms known to affect histamine synthesis or metabolism, such as rs 17740607, rs 2073440, rs 1801105, rs 2052129, rs 10156191, rs 1049742 and rs 1049793 in the HDC, HNMT and DAO genes. No major genetic associations with risk or with clinical presentation, and no gene-gene interactions, or gene-phenotype interactions (including age, gender, IgE concentration, antecedents of atopy, culprit drug or clinical presentation) were identified in patients. However, logistic regression analyses indicated that the presence of antecedents of atopy and the DAO SNP rs 2052129 (GG) were strongly related (P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 005, respectively) with selective hypersensitivity to ibuprofen. With regard to patients with selective hypersensitivity to ASA, men were more prone to develop such a reaction than women (P= 0. 011), and the detrimental DAO SNP rs 10156191 in homozygosity increased the risk of developing such hypersensitivity (P= 0. 039) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thirty-five Cochrane Reviews of {{randomised}} trials {{testing the}} analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain have been published.

OBJECTIVES: To summarise data from all Cochrane Reviews that have assessed the effects of pharmaceutical interventions for acute pain in adults with at least moderate pain following surgery, who {{have been given a}} single dose of oral analgesic taken alone. METHODS: We identified systematic reviews in The Cochrane Library through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single Review Group, had a standard title, and had as their primary outcome numbers of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. For individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat (NNT) for this outcome for each drug/dose combination, and also the percentage of participants achieving at least 50 % maximum pain relief, the mean of mean or median time to remedication, the percentage of participants remedicating by 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours, and results for participants experiencing at least one adverse event. MAIN RESULTS: The overview included 35 separate Cochrane Reviews with 38 analyses of single dose oral analgesics tested in acute postoperative pain models, with results from about 45, 000 participants studied in approximately 350 individual studies. The individual reviews included only high-quality trials of standardised design and outcome reporting. The reviews used standardised methods and reporting for both efficacy and harm. Event rates with placebo were consistent in larger data sets. No statistical comparison was undertaken. There were reviews but no trial data were available for acemetacin, meloxicam, nabumetone, nefopam, sulindac, tenoxicam, and tiaprofenic acid. Inadequate amounts of data were available for <b>dexibuprofen,</b> dextropropoxyphene 130 mg, diflunisal 125 mg, etoricoxib 60 mg, fenbufen, and indometacin. Where there was adequate information for drug/dose combinations (at least 200 participants, in at least two studies), we defined the addition of four comparisons of typical size (400 participants in total) with zero effect as making the result potentially subject to publication bias and therefore unreliable. Reliable results were obtained for 46 drug/dose combinations in all painful postsurgical conditions; 45 in dental pain and 14 in other painful conditions. NNTs varied from about 1. 5 to 20 for at least 50 % maximum pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. The proportion of participants achieving this level of benefit varied from about 30 % to over 70 %, and the time to remedication varied from two hours (placebo) to over 20 hours in the same pain condition. Participants reporting at least one adverse event were few and generally no different between active drug and placebo, with a few exceptions, principally for aspirin and opioids. Drug/dose combinations with good (low) NNTs were ibuprofen 400 mg (2. 5; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 4 to 2. 6), diclofenac 50 mg (2. 7; 95 % CI 2. 4 to 3. 0), etoricoxib 120 mg (1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 7 to 2. 1), codeine 60 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg (2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 8 to 2. 9), celecoxib 400 mg (2. 5; 95 % CI 2. 2 to 2. 9), and naproxen 500 / 550 mg (2. 7; 95 % CI 2. 3 to 3. 3). Long duration of action (≥ 8 hours) was found for etoricoxib 120 mg, diflunisal 500 mg, oxycodone 10 mg + paracetamol 650 mg, naproxen 500 / 550 mg, and celecoxib 400 mg.
