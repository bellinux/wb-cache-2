25|$|The {{spread of}} {{prostitution}} practices {{has introduced a}} large quantity of slang to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example <b>is</b> <b>news</b> of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage. Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.|$|E
500|$|The DVD, {{released}} on 25 September 2006, includes the same concert footage as the TV broadcast of 25 September 1969. The DVD includes three previously unseen songs which were filmed at the concert – [...] "Mercy, Mercy", [...] "Stray Cat Blues" [...] and [...] "No Expectations". The latter two are incomplete but are included here {{due to their}} uniqueness (HD). Also included <b>is</b> <b>news</b> footage of their early fame from 1964, footage of Mick Jagger discussing his arrest for drugs possession in July 1967 and his subsequent press conference on his release from prison, and a 1971 interview with Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts about their tour of France.|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Elphaba's {{opposition}} of the Wizard's regime has earned her the title [...] "The Wicked Witch of the West". Glinda has become the smiling public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title [...] "Glinda the Good" [...] and positioned by Morrible as the nation's defender against the Witch. A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as Captain of the Guard (a position he has accepted {{in order to find}} Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about the Witch, including an idiotic story that she will be melted by water. Fiyero is furious and not calmed by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba {{does not want to be}} found. He is further shocked when Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda. This <b>is</b> <b>news</b> to Fiyero and he storms off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but it is clear she realizes her dream life has come at a great price ("Thank Goodness").|$|E

2500|$|A {{writer for}} The Craftsman {{considered}} Men of the Docks to be [...] "free of affectation of soul or technique", presenting {{a situation of}} solidity the way a normal man would see it, thus holding onto the scene through reality. However, the art critics Robert W. Snyder and Rebecca Zurier consider the painting to leave viewers in suspense as to {{the exact nature of}} the message received by this group of men, whether it <b>is</b> <b>news</b> that no work is available or notice that the men can begin their labor. This tension, they write, paired with the juxtaposition of the skyline and harbor (almost hidden from land), emphasizes the precariousness of the laborers' situation.|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, ACT UP activist John Weir and {{two other}} activists entered the studio of the CBS Evening News at the {{beginning}} of the broadcast. They shouted [...] "AIDS <b>is</b> <b>news.</b> Fight AIDS, not Arabs!" [...] and Weir stepped in front of the camera before the control room cut to a commercial break. The same night ACT UP demonstrated at the studios of the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour. The next day activists displayed banners in Grand Central Terminal that said [...] "Money for AIDS, not for war" [...] and [...] "One AIDS death every 8 minutes." [...] One of the banners was handheld and displayed across the train timetable and the other attached to bundles of balloons that lifted it up to the ceiling of the station's enormous main room. These actions were part of a coordinated protest called [...] "Day of Desperation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, former Secretary Kissinger was feted by the [...] "dirty war" [...] generals as a much-touted {{guest of}} honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to The Nation editor Victor Navasky, protesting {{publication}} of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed that: [...] "At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate <b>is</b> <b>news</b> to all his former associates." [...] Ironically, Kissinger's posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false {{by none other than}} once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told William E. Knight, an oral historian working for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project: [...] "It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary, or it began to come to a head, in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower. Bob Hill, who was Ambassador then in Buenos Aires, a very conservative Republican politician -- by no means liberal or anything of the kind, began to report quite effectively about what was going on, this slaughter of innocent civilians, supposedly innocent civilians -- this vicious war that they were conducting, underground war.|$|E
