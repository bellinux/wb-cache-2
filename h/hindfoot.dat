5|$|Measurements for {{the first}} two known {{examples}} are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118mm (4.9 and 4.6in), tail length 115 and 110mm (4.5 and 4.3in), <b>hindfoot</b> length 27 and 28mm (1.1 and 1.1in), ear length 13 and 15mm (0.51 and 0.59in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0mm (1.17 and 1.14in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0g (1.62oz) and had testes 11mm (0.43in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128mm (5.0in), tail length of 150mm (5.9in), <b>hindfoot</b> length of 31mm (1.2in), and ear length of 19mm (0.75in).|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{than other}} dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor {{nevertheless}} shared {{many of the}} same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each <b>hindfoot,</b> which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.|$|E
5|$|In 66 to 74 {{specimens}} {{measured by}} Goodman and colleagues, total length was 87 to 96mm (3.4 to 3.8in), averaging 91.1mm (3.59in); tail length was 38 to 48mm (1.5 to 1.9in), averaging 42.4mm (1.67in); <b>hindfoot</b> length is 6 to 7mm (0.2 to 0.3in), averaging 6.3mm (0.25in); tragus length was 5 to 6mm (0.2 to 0.2in), averaging 5.8mm (0.23in); ear length was 9 to 11mm (about 0.4in), averaging 9.4mm (0.37in); forearm length was 35 to 40mm (1.4 to 1.6in), averaging 37.4mm (1.47in); and body mass was 3.8 to 7.3g (0.13 to 0.26oz), averaging 4.9g (0.17oz). There {{is no evidence}} for substantial size differences between males and females.|$|E
50|$|Among other South American cricetids, Abrothrix lanosus has white ungual tufts {{that are}} {{shorter than the}} claws. Akodon paranaensis has long ungual tufts. Calomys cerqueirai has silvery tufts on the second through fifth digits of the forefeet and all digits of the <b>hindfeet.</b> Abrawayaomys has long, dense ungual tufts. The Tylomyinae are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} ungual tufts on their <b>hindfeet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The authors {{concluded}} that its slender <b>hindfeet</b> {{meant that it}} was forced to move quadrupedally on land, suggesting a piscivore lifestyle as a specialised soarer.|$|R
5|$|The <b>hindfeet</b> {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the <b>hindfeet</b> are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|R
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and body length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the <b>hindfoot</b> length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the body mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was {{captured}} and released, {{the head and}} body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the <b>hindfoot</b> of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Psittacosaurus vary {{in size and}} {{specific}} features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-known—P. mongoliensis—can reach 2metres (6.5ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20kilogrammes (44lb) in P. mongoliensis. Several species approach P. mongoliensis in size (P. lujiatunensis, P. neimongoliensis, P. xinjiangensis), while others are somewhat smaller (P. sinensis, P. meileyingensis). The smallest known species, P. ordosensis, is 30% smaller than P. mongoliensis. The largest are P. lujiatunensis and P. sibiricus, although neither is significantly larger than P. mongoliensis. Psittacosaurus postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only four digits on the manus ('hand'), {{as opposed to the}} five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed <b>hindfoot</b> is very similar to many other small ornithischians.|$|E
5000|$|Lamia: Linnaeus wrote merely: [...] "Face of a man, breasts of a virgin, {{body of a}} four-footed animal but scaled, forefeet of a [...] "wild animal", <b>hindfeet</b> {{those of}} cattle".|$|R
50|$|In mammals, ungual tufts are {{tufts of}} hairs {{at the base}} of claws of the fore- and <b>hindfeet.</b> Their {{presence}} {{has been used as a}} character in cladistic studies of Cricetidae.|$|R
50|$|The dorsal pelage is brownish, the ventral pelage, greyish. It has small {{ears and}} a {{relatively}} long tail. There are crowns of {{hair on the}} <b>hindfeet</b> at the bases of the claws.|$|R
5|$|<b>Hindfoot</b> {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), <b>hindfoot</b> length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (<b>hindfoot),</b> with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
50|$|The creature's {{distinctly}} feline front paws seemed incongruous, {{and gave}} Koldewey some doubt. However, in 1918, he proposed that Iguanodon (a dinosaur with birdlike <b>hindfeet)</b> {{was the closest}} match to the sirrush (Sjögren, 1980).|$|R
5|$|The forearms {{are dark}} gray. The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual tufts of white hairs {{surround}} the equally unpigmented claws. The animal has long, narrow <b>hindfeet,</b> longer than in T.talamancae, with usually smooth soles (lacking squamae, which {{are present in}} T.talamancae). The three middle digits are much longer than the outer two. Six pads are present on the sole. The upper surface and {{the sides of the}} <b>hindfeet</b> are white and appear naked, although short, white hairs are present; these hairs are longer in T.talamancae. Ungual tufts of long, white or gray hairs are present around the claws, which are short and lack pigment.|$|R
50|$|The dusky caenolestid is {{characterized}} by a dark brown coat with a lighter underbelly, soft and thick fur, and a loosely haired tail. The head-and-body length is between 9.3 and 13.5 cm, the tail measures 9.3 to 12.7 cm and <b>hindfeet</b> are 2.2 cm long. The ears and eyes are smaller and the rostrum is longer than in other caenolestids. The forefeet have five digits each; while two of them are blunt, the other three digits bear sharp claws. The toes of the <b>hindfeet</b> bear sharp claws as well, except for the biggest toe. There are four teats and no pouch. A 2007 study recorded dental anomalies such as missing teeth and supernumerary teeth.|$|R
25|$|The limb {{bones of}} Barosaurus were {{virtually}} indistinguishable {{from those of}} Diplodocus. Both were quadrupedal, with columnar limbs adapted to support the enormous bulk of the animals. Barosaurus had proportionately longer forelimbs than other diplodocids, although they were still shorter than most other groups of sauropods. There was a single carpal bone in the wrist, and the metacarpals were more slender than those of Diplodocus. Barosaurus feet have never been discovered, but like other sauropods, {{it would have been}} digitigrade, with all four feet each bearing five small toes. A large claw adorned the inside digit on the manus (forefoot) while smaller claws tipped the inside three digits of the pes (<b>hindfoot).</b>|$|E

500|$|Salanoia durrelli {{most closely}} resembles the brown-tailed mongoose, {{which is a}} small, [...] mongoose-like carnivoran. It is reddish-brown overall, paler than the brown-tailed mongoose. The head and nape are speckled. The underparts are reddish-, not {{brownish}} as in the brown-tailed mongoose. Most of the tail is similar in color to the body, but the tip is yellowish-brown. The inner side of the well-furred external ear (pinna) is reddish-buff. The broad feet are naked below, with the naked skin buff on the forefeet and dark brown on the <b>hindfeet,</b> and show prominent pads. Each of the five digits on the fore- and <b>hindfeet</b> bears a long, dark brown claw. There are rows of stiff hairs along the outer margins of the feet. In contrast, the brown-tailed mongoose has narrower feet with more poorly developed pads. In S.durrelli, the fur is long and soft.|$|R
50|$|The black-shouldered opossum is {{characterized}} by a gray coat, gray underbelly with buff-tipped hairs, and broad black stripes that extend from the forefeet, meet on the shoulders, run along the midline of the back and then split into parallel stripes that run down the <b>hindfeet.</b> Indistinct dark lines run through the eyes. 60 to 75 percent of the length of the tail is darker than the coat dorsally (on the back), while the rest is white. Except for the last 75 percent of the length at the base, the tail is bushy. Like Caluromys species, its fur is soft, thick and woolly, and has a similar skull. However, it differs from them in having a shorter rostrum and larger molars. The head-and-body length is between 25 and 33 cm and the tail measures 31 - 40 cm. The <b>hindfeet</b> measure 6.7 cm, while the ears 3.7 cm.|$|R
