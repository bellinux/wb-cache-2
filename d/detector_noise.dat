2500|$|Several optical SETI {{experiments}} {{are now in}} progress. A Harvard-Smithsonian group that includes Paul Horowitz designed a laser detector and mounted it on Harvard's [...] optical telescope. This telescope is currently being used for a more conventional star survey, and the optical SETI survey is [...] "ing" [...] on that effort. Between October 1998 and November 1999, the survey inspected about 2,500 stars. Nothing that resembled an intentional laser signal was detected, but efforts continue. The Harvard-Smithsonian group is now working with Princeton University to mount a similar detector system on Princeton's 91-centimeter (36-inch) telescope. The Harvard and Princeton telescopes will be [...] "ganged" [...] to track the same targets at the same time, with the intent being to detect the same signal in both locations {{as a means of}} reducing errors from <b>detector</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} feature of a FROG measurement is that many more data points are collected than are strictly necessary to find the pulse electric field. [...] For example, say that the measured trace consists of 128 points in the delay direction and 128 points in the frequency direction. [...] There are 128×128 total points in the trace. [...] Using these points, an electric field is retrieved that has 2×128 points (128 for magnitude and another 128 for the phase). [...] This is a massively overdetermined system, meaning {{that the number of}} equations is much larger than the number of unknowns. [...] Thus the importance of each individual data point being absolutely correct is greatly reduced. [...] This is very helpful for real-world measurements that can be affected by <b>detector</b> <b>noise</b> and systematic errors. [...] Noise is extremely unlikely to affect the measured trace in a way that could be confused with a physical phenomenon in the pulse. [...] The FROG algorithm tends to “see through” these effects due to the amount of extra information available and the use of a mathematical form constraint in finding a solution. [...] This means that the error between an experimental FROG trace and a retrieved FROG trace is rarely zero, although it should be quite small for traces without systematic errors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes the median-type filters with {{an impulse}} <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> using the {{decision}} {{tree and the}} particle swarm optimization, for {{the recovery of the}} corrupted gray-level images by impulse noises. It first utilizes an impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> to determine whether a pixel is corrupted or not. If yes, the filtering component in this method is triggered to filter it. Otherwise, the pixel is kept unchanged. In this work, the impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> is an adaptive hybrid detector which is constructed by integrating 10 impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detectors</b> based on the decision tree and the particle swarm optimization. Subsequently, the restoring process in this method respectively utilizes the median filter, the rank ordered mean filter, and the progressive noise-free ordered median filter to restore the corrupted pixel.

In this particular proposal, there are four key issues {{that must be addressed}} before feasibility can be demonstrated: stability of the interferometer, loss from the source to the <b>detectors,</b> <b>noise</b> from extraneous and atmospheric photons, and mitigation of any other degrees of freedom besides the Shapiro delay that might introduce distinguishability (in particular, photon dispersion).

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, noise {{reduction}} {{performance of a}} switching vector median filter with a random-valued impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> for color images is evaluated. As a random-valued impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector,</b> a method utilizing the minimum spanning tree (MST) is employed. In the switching vector median filter, the impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> is employed before filtering, and the detection result is used to control whether a pixel should be filtered or not. By applying the method to color images, {{it is expected that}} the impulse noise is reduced pointedly while preserving detailed structures such as thin lines, sharp corners, and so on. Through some experiments, for color images, the effectiveness of the combination of the MST-based random-valued impulse <b>noise</b> <b>detector</b> and the switching vector median filter is verified. Particularly, the present method is compared to some powerful switching vector median filters which had been proposed so far from a view point that the impulse {{noise reduction}} while preserving edges and details of an image is realized or not...|$|R

50|$|The {{multiplex}} or Fellgett's advantage. This {{arises from}} the fact that information from all wavelengths is collected simultaneously. It results in a higher Signal-to-noise ratio for a given scan-time for observations limited by a fixed <b>detector</b> <b>noise</b> contribution (typically in the thermal infrared spectral region where a photodetector is limited by generation-recombination noise). For a spectrum with m resolution elements, this increase is equal to the square root of m. Alternatively, it allows a shorter scan-time for a given resolution. In practice multiple scans are often averaged, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by the square root of the number of scans.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the photon {{nature of}} X-rays, {{intensity}} measurements inevitably contain shot noise, which follows a Poisson distribution. Other types of noise, like <b>detector</b> <b>noise</b> or electrical noise can {{also contribute to}} fluctuations of the measured X-ray signal but do not provide information about the studied sample. In comparison, X-ray intensity changes arising from the alteration of attenuation carry important motion information.

The resonant frequency of a qPlus sensor is typically {{lower than that of}} a silicon microcantilever, ~25 kHz (Watch tuning forks have a resonant frequency of 32,768 kHz before tip placement). Several factors (in particular <b>detector</b> <b>noise</b> and eigenfrequency) affect the speed of operation. qPlus sensors with long tip wires that approach the length of the sensor display a movement of the apex which is no longer perpendicular to the surface, thus probing the forces in a different direction to expected.|$|E

Moreover, from these series of (in many cases underexposed) images, the number of detected photons can be determined for each pixel. Observed photon counts fluctuate due to different noise sources and motion within the sample.In its simplest form, the mean, variance, error of the mean, and error of the variance of the signal intensities are calculated from the image series for each pixel and a single image then is reconstructed from each of these statistical parameters.
