5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|The Hongwu Emperor (ruled 1368–98) {{attempted}} {{to create a}} society of self-sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid, immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty: the empire's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy's dockyards in Nanjing were {{the largest in the}} world. He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates, enfeoffing his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang Ming Zu Xun, a set of published dynastic instructions. This failed spectacularly when his teenage successor, the Jianwen Emperor, {{attempted to}} curtail his uncles' power, prompting the Jingnan Campaign, an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402. The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing, constructed the Forbidden City, and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments. He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats. One, Zheng He, led seven enormous voyages of <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of European <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> {{the area in the}} late 17th century, Lake Michigan became part of a line of {{waterways}} leading from the Saint Lawrence River to the Mississippi River and thence to the Gulf of Mexico.

25|$|In {{addition}} to rabbits and mice, {{this approach has}} been explored for other animals. Researchers have attempted to replicate similar results when targeting the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Australia using such vectors as Salmonella typhimurium, vaccinia, and canine herpesvirus, but no reduction in fertility has been achieved thus far {{for a variety of}} reasons. Initial <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the control of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand using the nematode Parastrongyloides trichosuri has identified it as a possible immunocontraceptive vector.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, Thomson {{showed that}} cathode rays were {{composed}} of previously unknown negatively charged particles, which he calculated must have bodies {{much smaller than}} atoms and a very large value for their charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, {{as part of his}} <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and {{led to the development of}} the mass spectrograph.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was {{cut into}} the tel by the {{national}} water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system.

The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements. It also revealed the plaster floors – the first evidence of what would later be identified as the MB II palaces. The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.|$|E
25|$|The Mystery of a Hansom Cab is {{a mystery}} fiction novel by Australian writer Fergus Hume. The book was first {{published}} in Australia, in 1886. Set in Melbourne, the story focuses on the investigation of a homicide involving a body discovered in a hansom cab, as well as an <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the social class divide in the city. The book was successful in Australia, selling 100,000 copies in the first two print runs. It was then published in Britain and the United States, and went on to sell over 500,000 copies worldwide, outselling the first of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet (1887).|$|E
25|$|In 1912, {{as part of}} his <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the {{composition}} of the streams of positively charged particles then known as canal rays, Thomson and his research assistant F. W. Aston channelled a stream of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a photographic plate in its path. They observed two patches of light on the photographic plate (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection, and concluded that neon is composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22), that is to say of two isotopes. This was the first evidence for isotopes of a stable element; Frederick Soddy had previously proposed the existence of isotopes to explain the decay of certain radioactive elements.|$|E

25|$|Human dissections {{were carried}} out by the Greek {{physicians}} Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios {{in the early part of}} the third century BC. During this period, the first <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> full human anatomy was performed rather than a base knowledge gained from 'problem-solution' delving. Before and after this time investigators appeared to largely limit themselves to animals. While there was a deep taboo within the Greek culture concerning human dissection, there was a strong push by the government to build Greece into a hub of medical insight. For a time, Roman law forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body, so physicians had to use other cadavers. Galen, for example, dissected the Barbary macaque and other primates, assuming their anatomy was basically the same as that of humans.|$|E
25|$|Eager to {{establish}} his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion. This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police. One favorite was Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed {{the construction of the}} Forbidden City. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment. These scholars completed the monumental Yongle Encyclopedia during his reign.|$|E

[...] The book, a chronology of the great guitarists of rock which includes both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, observed the band's evolution in comparison with their previous album, Show No Mercy, saying, [...] "The musicianship is improved, as is lead singer Tom Araya's voice, making the band sound less like hacks and more like metal fiends.

500|$|Music writers {{note that}} the album was {{inspired}} by the San Francisco music scene, with Allmusic's Bryan Carroll citing the [...] "general street vibe of San Francisco's Mission district".

According to one music writer, the title of the album reflects its [...] "spicy fusion of soul, funk, hip-hop and Latin flavors stirred up in an intoxicating downtempo gumbo that is hard to resist". According to Carmen Johnson of Prefix magazine, the album has Tommy Guerrero, a San Francisco-native, [...] "oozing soul in every track".

Music writer Ann Powers interprets West's predominant theme on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to be [...] "the crisis of the jet-lagged cosmopolitan ... the exhausted cry of one who's always new in town, chasing whatever goal or girl is in the room, fueled by consumer culture's relentless buzz, but finally left unsatisfied". Powers views the songs to work [...] "as pornographic boasts, romantic disaster stories, devil-haunted dark nights of the soul" [...] and perceives West's [...] "uncertainty about his own place in the world" [...] to be connected to the subject of race, stating [...] "The rootlessness West celebrates and despairs of on Fantasy belongs to someone who feels unwelcome everywhere. This isn't just a personal problem. It's the curse of what the author Michael Eric Dyson has called 'the exceptional black man', embraced for his talents but singled out for the color of his skin".|$|E

500|$|Months later, {{during an}} April 1988 {{appearance}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump discussed his displeasure with the United States' {{status as a}} [...] "debtor nation" [...] and its seeming inability to compete with Japan. [...] Winfrey asked Trump if he would ever run for president. [...] He replied, [...] "Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country get ripped off ... I just don't think I have the inclination to do it." [...] Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would win the election. [...] He later appeared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. [...] In an interview on the floor, NBC News reporter Chris Wallace asked whether Trump's visit to his first national convention would induce him to [...] "take the plunge" [...] into a presidential campaign. [...] In response, Trump downplayed his prior <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> presidential politics, though repeated that he would win if he ever ran, and praised then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush.

[...] Talk of a potential Trump candidacy grew silent {{for much of the}} next decade.|$|E
500|$|Late in the decade, {{there was}} a brief <b>exploration</b> <b>into</b> the idea of {{launching}} a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a potential source of programming talent. In fact, Bamberger Broadcasting's WOR-TV & WOIC (the latter a Washington, D.C. video outlet) maintained letterhead with [...] "Mutual Television" [...] decorating their identifications. Beyond this, there is no confirmation, however, that a cooperative video service was ever seriously considered. The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became {{the only one of the}} [...] "Big Four" [...] U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of ABC, [...] NBC, CBS or DuMont. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and [...] "reality" [...] programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a [...] "misery show," [...] Queen for a Day [...] "awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled him—and who, by the way, also needed heart surgery." [...] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings. In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.|$|E
