The anionic phospholipids dioleoylphosphatidic acid, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin were all found to support activities lower than that supported by <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine.</b> In mixtures of <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> and 20 mol % anionic phospholipids, the presence of anionic phospholipids all resulted in lower activities than in <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine,</b> except for dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol whose presence had little effect on activity. In some cases, the low activity in the presence of anionic phospholipid followed from a decrease in vmax; in some cases, it followed from an increase in the Km for diacylglycerol, {{and in the case of}} dioleoylphosphatidic acid, it followed from both. Activities in mixtures containing 80 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were lower than in <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> at temperatures where both lipids adopted a bilayer phase; at higher temperatures where dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine preferred a hexagonal HII phase, the differences in activity were greater.

The molar ratio between <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> and sphingomyelin was set to 1 : 1, the cholesterol content was varied between 0 and 45 mol %, the water content was 40 wt %, and the temperature was varied between 293 and 333 K. The diffusion coefficients were separated into fast and slow spectral components by using the CORE method for global analysis of correlated spectral data. A large two-phase region, tentatively assigned to the liquid disordered (ld) and the liquid ordered (lo) phases, was present in the phase diagram. The ld phase was enriched in <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> and exhibited diffusion coefficients that were about {{three to five times}} larger than for the lo phase. Both the diffusion coefficients and the apparent activation energies for the quarternary systems were compatible with earlier reports on ternary phospholipid/cholesterol/water systems. However, in contrast to the latter ternary systems, the exchange of lipids between the lo and the ld phases was slow on the timescale for the diffusion experiment for the quarternary ones. This means that on the millisecond timescale fluid, ordered domains are floating around in a sea of faster diffusing lipids, assigned to consist of mainly <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine...</b>|$|E

To spontaneously adsorb lipid bilayers also on the atomic force microscope tip, the tips were first coated with gold and a monolayer of mercapto undecanol. Calculations indicate that long-chain hydroxyl terminated alkyl thiols tend to enhance spontaneous vesicle fusion because of an increased van der Waals attraction as compared to short-chain thiols. Interactions measured between <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine,</b> dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and dioleoyloxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride showed the electrostatic double-layer force plus a shorter-range repulsion which decayed exponentially with a decay length of 0. 7 nm for <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine,</b> 1. 2 nm for dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and 0. 8 nm for dioleoyloxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride.

A {{detailed analysis of the}} cyclic voltammograms of UQ in the above lipid environments points to a mechanism consisting of an elementary electron transfer step followed by two protonation (or deprotonation) steps in quasiequilibrium and by a further electron transfer step. In a lipid environment of solid-ordered (so) microdomains in a liquid-disordered (ld) matrix, electron transport across the lipid monolayer takes place in the ld phase. In a pure so phase, UQ tends to segregate into UQ-rich pools, exhibiting reversible electron transfer steps. In a lipid environment consisting of liquid-ordered (lo) microdomains (lipid rafts) in an ld matrix, UQ molecules tend to localize {{along the edge of the}} lipid rafts. However, in a lipid environment consisting exclusively of lo and so microdomains, UQ molecules tend to segregate into UQ-rich pools.

These techniques have millisecond temporal resolution, permitting low- and high-affinity conformational states of the nAcChoR to be resolved following mixing with the fluorescent partial agonist Dns-C 6 -Cho from their characteristic Dns-C 6 -Cho dissociation rates. Our studies reveal that prior to agonist-induced affinity state conversion, nAcChoRs reconstituted into either DOPC or DOPC/DOPA/cholesterol are predominantly in a conformational state that has a low affinity for agonist. Prolonged exposure to Dns-C 6 -Cho converts nearly all DOPC/DOPA/cholesterol-reconstituted nAcChoRs to the high-affinity state. In contrast, Dns-C 6 -Cho converts only half of all DOPC-reconstituted nAcChoRs to the high-affinity state. The other half persists in a low-affinity state characterized by a Kd for Dns-C 6 -Cho of 0. 61 ± 0. 07 μM. This Kd {{is similar to that}} previously reported for Dns-C 6 -Cho binding to low-affinity, resting-state nAcChoRs in native membranes. However, affinity state conversion of DOPC-reconstituted nAcChoRs may be facilitated by re-reconstituting them into bilayers composed of DOPC/DOPA/cholesterol.

An essential control is introduced to discriminate between Ca 2 +-arsenazo III complex formation inside the vesicles, as a consequence of Ca 2 + influx, and outside the vesicles, as a consequence of arsenazo III leakage from the vesicles. Furthermore, some minor improvements are added, like the use of large unilamellar vesicles instead of multilamellar vesicles, and the use of dual wavelength spectrophotometry. Using this method, it was found that <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> vesicles, containing 20 mol% dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, were impermeable to Ca 2 +.

The synthetic antigenic probe N-glucosylated peptide CSF 114 (Glc) and its unglucosylated form interact with the polar heads of lipid SAMs of <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> at nonzero transmembrane potentials, probably establishing a dual electrostatic {{interaction of}} the trimethylammonium and phosphate groups of the phosphatidylcholine polar head with the Glu 5 and His 9 residues on the {{opposite ends of the}} CSF 114 (Glc) β-turn encompassing residues 6 - 9.

Other sterols, due to their structural similarities to cholesterol, are often assumed to have a universal effect on membrane properties similar to the condensing effect of cholesterol, albeit possibly to different degrees. We used x-ray diffraction to investigate this assumption. By the combination of lamellar diffraction and grazing-angle scattering, we measured the membrane thickness and the tilt-angle distribution of the lipid’s hydrocarbon chains. This method is sensitive to phase separation, which is important for examining the miscibility of sterols and phospholipids. Mixtures of ergosterol or cholesterol with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, and <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> were systematically studied. We found that mixing ergosterol with phospholipids into a single phase became increasingly difficult with higher sterol concentrations and also with higher concentrations of unsaturated lipid chains. The only condensing effect of ergosterol was found in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, although the effect was less {{than one-third of the}} effect of cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol, ergosterol could not maintain a fixed electron density profile of the surrounding lipids independent of hydration. In <b>dioleoylphosphatidylcholine</b> and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, ergosterol made the membranes thinner, opposite to the effect of cholesterol. In all cases, the tilt-angle variation of the chain diffraction was consistent with the membrane thickness changes measured by lamellar diffraction, i. e., a thickening was always associated with a reduction of chain tilt angles.
