Process cheese held in the cooker at 82 °C for up to 4 o minutes became less meltable and more firm and the emulsion became finer while that held at 82 °C outside of the cooker without agitation was only slightly affected. Loss of meltability and increased firmness associated with pro-longed cooking of process cheese {{is associated with the}} state of the fat emulsion and not with the effect of heat on the proteins per se. The level of rework cheese had a great influence on the cheese rheological properties {{as well as on the}} microstructure of process cheese. There was a poor emulsion when no <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> was used regardless of the percent rework cheese added.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a food-grade long-chain polyphosphate mixture on the growth and survival of spoilage micro-organisms during storage in an experimental processed cheese spread formulation was evaluated. The <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> {{was added to the}} cheese blend at a concentration of 0. 5 % or 1. 0 %. A control product was also manufactured, which contained monophosphate instead of polyphosphate as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt,</b> with all other ingredients being identical to those in the experimental processed cheese spread. Half of the finished products were subjected to accelerated shelf-life testing at 37 °C for 10 days, whereas the other half of them was stored refrigerated at 4 °C for 120 days. Microbiological analyses (enumeration of viable cell counts, mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia, coliforms, yeasts and moulds) and sensory tests were performed at regular intervals. The results showed that polyphosphates had a beneficial effect on the shelf-life of the processed cheese spread tested in that they significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) the growth or survival rates of spoilage bacteria, especially of mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia. Polyphosphates also beneficially influenced the sensory, including textural properties of the experimental processed cheese spread. All the samples containing less than 1 % polyphosphate showed signs of butyric blowing significantly earlier (P< 0. 05), during both accelerated shelf-life tests and regular refrigerated storage, than did the products fortified with 1 % polyphosphate.

40|$|A {{reformed}} Swiss cheese product (RSCP) {{that does}} not contain <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> and which possess textural properties {{similar to that of}} natural Swiss cheese was developed.

Development of this product may add value to the natural Swiss cheese trimmings that are by-products of cheese manufacture as another option to processed cheese. The development began with the exploration of the effects of starch on the properties (texture, melting behavior, and chemical profile) of a processed cheese product which contained <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts.</b> Results of texture profile analysis using a TAXT 2 texture analyzer suggest that starch addition may significantly increase hardness and chewiness.

40|$|Four {{batches of}} pasteurized process cheese were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate, disodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> concentration (2. 5 %). The process cheese was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> affected the physical properties of the process cheese differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on process cheese should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} efficiencies {{of some of}} {{the common}} wetting agents have been determined by measuring the surface tension of five-minute-old surfaces of the solutions using the ring method in a modified form. Aqueous solutions giving a surface tension of 37 dynes per cm. may be considered to have good wetting properties. It is found that wetting power is not necessarily associated with detergent and <b>emulsifying</b> properties. <b>Salts</b> greatly increase wetting power. Bivalent cations are more effective than univalent cations in increasing wetting power. A moderate degree of hardness in water employed in preparing solutions of wetting agents may be of advantage in the textile industry.

A blend of potassium citrate and dipotassium phosphate (1 : 1) was used as an emulsifying salt. Changes in sensory attributes, physico-chemical characteristics, and functional properties of PMC were analyzed and compared with the corresponding changes in a control PMC made with NaCl and trisodium citrate. Products were evaluated after regular intervals of 7  days up to 56  days. Significant differences in flavor (28 – 56  days), sensory body and texture, acid degree value (0 – 42  days), soluble protein, titratable acidity (7 – 56  days), pH (7 – 56  days), meltability (0 – 56  days), and stretchability (4 – 49) were evident between the control and experimental PMC over storage. It appears that potassium replacement of sodium resulted in a low decrease in casein hydration and an increase in pH and bitterness.

Since other fats and oils which have been irradiated are bactericidal {{on account of the}} active oxygen released on contact with bacteria, the mechanism of the bactericidal action of irradiated lipids {{of the skin}} must be similar because the lipids have the properties of other irradiated fats and oils. Irradiation increases the active oxygen content of dried skin markedly but little increase occurs if the lipids have been extracted.

To be effective, orally-delivered probiotics should reach the human intestine in relatively high numbers and in a viable state; therefore, they have to tolerate the stresses associated to the gastro-intestinal (GI) environment. All along the different GI sections, bacteria are challenged by several sources of stress, including the action of digestive enzymes, low pH and <b>emulsifying</b> bile <b>salts.</b> Bacterial cells are naturally equipped with various defense mechanisms to enhance survival in hostile environments [2]; these include chaperones to assist the re-folding of denatured proteins and proteases which degrade irreversibly damaged proteins. The food matrix used to deliver microbes may considerably contribute to their probiotic action, e. g. by enhancing survival to stress, stimulating selective growth and favouring gut colonization. Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) is a widespread lactic acid bacterium which is recognized as a probiotic and is traditionally employed as a food starter. The stress tolerance of Lp WCFS 1 was examined in a previously developed in vitro system that simulates the human GI tract [3]. Different carrier matrices {{were used to assess}} their protective and buffering properties. Higher survival was observed for bacteria included in complex and/or nutrient-rich matrices, and when potential prebiotics were added, thus highlighting the relevance of matrix composition in shielding and growth-promoting effects. The molecular response of Lp WCFS 1 to the simulated GI system was analysed by studying the transcriptional pattern of bacterial genes involved both in stress response (i. e. chaperones, shsp, proteases) and in exerting beneficial effects on the host (i. e. bacteriocins, adhesion factors). Transcription of bacterial stress-related genes remarkably matched the extent of stress during the GI transit, as revealed by the observed survival rate. Indeed, the GI steps of higher mortality corresponded to major induction of typical stress genes, thus implying their involvement in the mechanisms of cellular adaptation to GI stress. GI environment consistently up-regulated probiosis-associated genes. Data obtained with the different vehicle matrices may be valuable for the development of protective and host/bacteria-friendly carriers in the design of functional food. Transcriptional analysis paves the way to the use of some bacterial genes as molecular markers for the screening of strains with potential probiotic applications. Our results also suggest cues to improve reliability and performance of in vitro GI simulators. References 1.

Two commercial infant formulas of similar composition but in a powder or a liquid form were submitted to an in vitro dynamic digestive system. The digestion products from the gastric and intestinal compartments were characterized during 180 min by SDS-PAGE and Thin-Layer Chromatography to follow the kinetics of proteolysis and lipolysis, respectively. Changes in the structure of effluents were evaluated by confocal microscopy, light scattering and rheological methods. Results showed different structural and molecular behaviors between the 2 formulas. L had fat globules smaller than P, leading to a higher specific surface. After 30 min, protein destabilization was observed for both formulas and became definitive at 120 min. Viscosity of P and L was similar before digestion but increased dramatically for L at 120 min of gastric digestion. Overall, during the gastric phase, caseins were hydrolyzed more rapidly than the other milk proteins particularly for L and -lactoglobulin was more resistant to hydrolysis than caseins. The same behavior was observed for lipolysis kinetics with a more rapid hydrolysis of TAG for L than for P. During the intestinal phase, proteins were hydrolyzed instantaneously by the pancreatic enzymes and lipids were <b>emulsified</b> by bile <b>salts,</b> so that no difference in structure or in kinetics of hydrolysis was observed between the 2 formulas. Our results highlighted the impact of the structure of the 2 formulas on their behavior during the gastric phase that appears as a key step during in vitro digestion...|$|R

40|$|The Team {{has been}} {{contracted}} by Mordor Oil to plan, design, {{and evaluate the}} feasibility of an early production facility (EPF) in Batman, Turkey that will produce 10, 000 barrels per day (BPD) of crude oil that meets industry standards. The 10, 000 BPD is split evenly between two types of crude: heavy and light. The heavy crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 16 degrees, a gas/oil ratio (GOR) of 150, a delivery temperature range of 20 - 30 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 450 psia, 13 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. The light crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an API gravity of 37 degrees, a GOR of 600, a delivery temperature range of 18 to 40 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 700 psia, 23 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. Despite the differing inlet conditions, the product sales specifications are the same: a basic sediment and water (BS&W) content of less than 0. 5 weight percent, a relative vapor pressure (RVP) of less than 10 psia, an H 2 S concentration of less than 20 ppm, a salt concentration of less than 10 pounds per barrel (PTB), and an overall sulfur concentration of less than 2 weight percent. In order to achieve these specifications, the Team designed two processes that run in parallel, meaning that the light and heavy crudes remain separate. Within the process, the crude encounters a phase separator to extract the free flowing water and natural gas that enters from the well, two electrostatic coalescers (ECs) in series to remove <b>emulsified</b> water and <b>salts,</b> and a stripping tower to absorb hydrogen sulfide into nitrogen gas. Between these major pieces of equipment, additional features like heaters, mixers, valves, and flares are used to reduce the viscosity of the oil, mix in freshwater, control pressure drops, and burn excess gases, respectively. Wastewater is piped off site to a wastewater treatment facility and then returns to the facility as process water. The nitrogen used to strip hydrogen sulfide is produced via a nitrogen generation process. Because this is a grassroots plant, the Team also included designs for housing, office space and a cafeteria. Each piece of equipment is designed and optimized...|$|R
40|$|Ternary {{mixtures}} {{consisting of}} phosphate and citrate <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> were studied for {{their impact on}} selected textural properties (especially hardness) of processed cheese spreads over a 30 day storage period at 6 ± 2 °C. Two different groups of samples were manufactured, one with pH adjustment (target values within the interval of 5. 60 - 5. 80) and one without pH adjustment. When binary mixtures with trisodium citrate (TSC) and tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP) were used (with zero content of the other salts tested in the ternary mixture), the products consisting of TSC and TSPP {{at a ratio of}} approximately 1 : 1 were the hardest. Increasing the content of TSC, TSPP and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate and decreasing that of disodium hydrogen phosphate (DSP) in ternary mixtures resulted in the increasing of the hardness of processed cheese. The absolute values of processed cheese hardness significantly changed as a result of pH adjustment. Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic [IGA/FT/ 2013 / 010, IGA/FT/ 2014 / 001...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the dependence of selected textural (texture profile analysis, TPA) and viscoelastic properties of processed cheese on the composition of ternary mixtures of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> [disodium hydrogenphosphate, DSP; tetrasodium diphosphate, TSPP; sodium salt of polyphosphate (with mean length n ≈ 20), P 20; and trisodium citrate, TSC] during a 60 -d storage period (6 ± 2 °C). The processed cheese samples [40 % wt/wt dry matter (DM) content, 50 % wt/wt fat in DM content] were manufactured using Swiss-type cheese (as the main raw material) with 4 different maturity degrees (4, 8, 12, and 16 wk of ripening). Moreover, the pH of the samples was adjusted (the target values within the range of 5. 60 - 5. 80), corresponding to the standard pH values of spreadable processed cheese. With respect to the individual application of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> (regardless of the maturity degree of the Swiss-type cheese applied), the samples prepared with P 20 were the hardest, followed by those prepared with TSPP, TSC, and DSP. Furthermore, a specific ratio of DSP:TSPP (1 : 1) led to {{a significant increase in the}} hardness of the samples. On the whole, the hardness of all processed cheese samples increased with the prolonging storage period, whereas their hardness significantly dropped with the rising ripening stage of the raw material utilized. In all of the cases, the trends of hardness development remained analogous, and only the absolute values differed significantly. Moreover, the findings of TPA were in accordance with those of the rheological analysis. In particular, the specific ratio of DSP:TSPP (1 : 1) resulted in the highest gel strength and interaction factor values, followed by P 20, TSPP, TSC, and DSP (used individually), reporting the same trend which was demonstrated by TPA. The monitored values of the gel strength and interaction factor decreased with the increasing maturity degree of the Swiss-type cheese used. The intensity of the rigidity of the samples showed an analogous relationship to the intensity of the gel strength; the higher the gel strength of the sample, the more inflexible the product is expected to be. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.
