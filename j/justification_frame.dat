40|$|We {{develop an}} {{abstract}} theory of justifications suitable for describing the semantics {{of a range}} of logics in knowledge representation, computational and mathematical logic. A theory or program in one of these logics induces a semantical structure called a <b>justification</b> <b>frame.</b> Such a <b>justification</b> <b>frame</b> defines a class of justifications each of which embodies a potential reason why its facts are true. By defining various evaluation functions for these justifications, a range of different semantics are obtained. By allowing nesting of justification frames, various language constructs can be integrated in a seamless way. The theory provides elegant and compact formalisations of existing and new semantics in logics of various areas, showing unexpected commonalities and interrelations, and creating opportunities for new expressive knowledge representation formalisms. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Published online : 17 February 2014 This article {{examines}} {{whether and how}} the Euro crisis has affected the long-term trends of politicization of Europe in France. Has the crisis fueled the extent of politicization? Do we observe shifts in specific aspects of Europe being politicized? Are the patterns of opposition changing? To answer these questions, the authors compare the electoral campaign in 2012 with all French campaigns since 1974. Additionally, France is put in a broader comparative perspective. Politicization is conceptualized as three interrelated dimensions: issue salience, actor expansion, and polarization. Methodologically, the {{article is based on}} a relational content analysis of newspaper articles. The findings show that the Euro crisis boosted the level of politicization, and economic policies, as well as <b>justification</b> <b>frames</b> became more important. However, the degree of polarization was higher in election campaigns that focused more on constitutional conflicts over membership and were dominated by concerns with national identity and sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the Supreme Court and newsprint media interface with and react to each other’s arguments, <b>justification,</b> and <b>framing</b> {{of the death}} penalty. As the philosophical justification behind the use of capital punishment evolves, how can we describe {{the similarities and differences}} between how the Supreme Court frames issues of capital punishment and how the press portrays the same? Using a case-study analysis, this paper identifies three sets of chronologically- related and issue-related death penalty cases (from 1971 to 2005) and compares the presence and importance of the varying Supreme Court arguments and newspaper frames. I find that, while the Supreme Court appears to set the boundaries of the death penalty debate for newsprint media, the latter may actually set the agenda of the Court when it strategically 1.) makes comparisons to foreign legal practices or 2.) alleges that caprice and bias pervade through the American capital punishment mechanism.

40|$|Has the {{authority}} of the sovereign state system undergone a fundamental transformation in recent decades? This dissertation seeks to: 1) offer a critical examination of claims regarding the perceived fracture and erosion of sovereign state authority; 2) contribute to the task of building a theoretical framework to study the power and authority of the sovereign state system and its changes over time; 3) find evidence of patterns in how the nature of that power and authority changes over time and across different political organizations in the context of war. Theoretically, the characterization of the threat non-state combatants pose to {{the authority}} of the state system neglects relations of power between those who hold privilege within that system and those who are excluded from its benefits. Empirically, there has been an absence of systematic study of potential authoritative transformations that is both historically and geographically broad. This dissertation analyzes the language of justification for war - as expressions of political authority - used by political and military leaders from 1618 - 2008, employing a combination of fuzzy-sets qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) with interpretive case analysis to determine the constellations of conditions which drive the use of justification for war. Findings indicate that non-state actors are not challenging the authoritative logic underlying the sovereign state system; rather, the use of sovereign rights logics of justification in asymmetrical conflicts indicates a desire to access the benefits and privileges of that system. When interpreted through a post-colonial and critical race lens, these claims appear as a challenge to exclusion that is largely rooted in a legacy of racialized colonial subjugation. Relations of power, embedded in a state system that developed through imperial conquest and colonial domination, drive the use of <b>justification</b> <b>frames.</b> Thus, low power actors may in fact threaten the stability of the sovereign state system, but not in the manner characterized by the fracture narrative. The threat is not to the authoritative logic of the system, but rather to the uneven distribution of the powers and privileges of that system that stems from a legacy of colonization, which produced lasting divisions in power...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for {{the identification of}} benefits for technology research and development projects. It specifically addresses projects involving new process technologies. It focuses on identifying and presenting both financial and strategic benefits of the project in an integrated manner. It uses a proven multi-attribute <b>justification</b> tool and <b>frames</b> it within a larger structured methodology for designing and planning the benefits measurement process through experiments and pilot implementations. The methodology supports the comparison of dissimilar projects having different strategic benefits. Finally, it acts as tool to aid the technologist in identifying and presenting the benefits of his technology. Keywords Project Selection, Multi-Attribute Decision Making, Management of Technology 1.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a logical frame {{allowing}} us to display the argumentative features behind legal decisions. This undertaking is motivated by Hans Kelsen's solution to a well-known puzzle in legal philosophy, called Jørgensen's dilemma. In {{the first part of}} the text, we deliver a detailed presentation of the problem, as well as two of the many attempts to a solution. Then we present what we consider to be the final solution, given by the legal philosopher Hans Kelsen. Based on this approach, the second part presents our attempts to provide, by means of a di-alogical frame, an original application of the Kelsenian solution in the field of legal <b>justification.</b> This logical <b>frame</b> not only perfectly displays Kelsen's approach but it also allows to express, debate and justify the legal reasoning without transgressing the limits between the legal field of normative creation and the scientific field of normative justification...|$|R
40|$|August 2010, an {{internal}} Department for International Development (DFID) paper was leaked that {{pointed to a}} significant shift in Britain’s aid policy. In particular it was muted that development projects {{would be expected to}} make the ‘maximum possible contribution’ to British national security. This revelation caused outrage amongst many NGOs. Oxfam, Action Aid, Christian Aid, Save the Children Fund and Cafod responded swiftly, lodging their concerns about national security interests being put at the heard of aid policy in a joint letter to the Guardian newspaper. This reaction was understandable but in some ways surprising – surprising because the links between security and aid have already converged considerably since the events of 9 / 11. Moreover, these processes of securitising aid were already well underway from the late 1980 s onwards {{in the context of the}} `New Wars’. What is different from September 2001 onwards is that this securitisation of aid has extended beyond the niche of post-conflict countries to aid and development policy more broadly. By the securitisation of aid we understand the increasing absorption of global and national security interests into the <b>framing,</b> <b>justification,</b> design and implementation of aid and development policies...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{asserts that}} there are three major tenets of the social contract: (1) safety and soundness, (2) {{consumer}} protection, and (3) access to credit. Regulators can and should require banks to meet standards in these areas to benefit society even if these measures reasonably reduce bank profits. Implicit in the social contract is the idea that each party must give up something in the exchange. This Article provides policymakers not only the appropriate narrative and <b>justifications</b> needed to <b>frame</b> their regulatory philosophy, but it also provides important textual support from the most prominent acts of banking legislation to give regulators the authority and charge to ensure that banks fulfill the public’s needs. In Part I, this Article provides a historical background of the social contract and demonstrates that the social contract between banks and the government has existed since the inception of banking in this country and has changed several times to meet changing circumstances and needs. In Part II, the Article describes the various governmental measures that protect banks and essentially serve as a safety net and why this government support justifies imposing public obligations on banks. Part III defines the critical elements of any social contract going forward, such as safety and soundness, consumer protection, and access to credit. Part IV demonstrates how regulators can build on existing language and tests in banking legislation to recognize and enforce banking’s social contract...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{undertakes}} a close {{analysis of}} Leo Strauss’s remarkable but undertreated Leo Strauss on Plato’s “Symposium,” reading it as opening a privileged purview {{of his own}} (and his students’) wider understandings of philosophy, poetry, and politics. The essay begins by drawing out Strauss’s three <b>framing</b> <b>justifications</b> for his manner of reading the Symposium as a document in the “ancient quarrel” of philosophy and poetry concerning {{which of the two}} should rightly shape the culture and ethical ideals of the Greeks (part 1). Then, following the course of Plato’s Symposium, the essay ascends through Strauss’s readings of the first five speeches in Plato’s dialogue (part 2) toward the highlight of Strauss’s reading, namely, his three remarkable sessions on Socrates’s speech. Part 3 analyses Strauss’s reading of this speech up to its climax, which Strauss argues involves the philosophical “demotion of poetry”: a criticism of poets as motivated by the Eros of fame and of tragic poetry as at its best creating captivating images of gods and heroes which reflect their creators’ self-love and patriotic love of “one’s own,”as against any transpolitical truth. Part 4 then looks at Strauss’s unusual reading of the culmination of Socrates’s great speech (Diotima on the “higher mysteries”) alongside Alkibiades’s speech in the Symposium as representing Plato’s “poetic presentation of philosophy. ” The essay becomes more critical as it proceeds. Strauss’s reading of the Symposium, like his reading of the Republic, is remarkable for its own “demotion of metaphysics” in Plato, and in my concluding remarks, I will question this status, or disappearance, of metaphysics in Strauss’s Platonism and whether this disappearance compromises Strauss 2 ̆ 7 ability to differentiate philosophy as he sees it from poetry...|$|R
