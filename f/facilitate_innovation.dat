5000|$|The {{historical}} pharmaceutical QMS applies {{primarily to}} {{good manufacturing practice}} as described in existing ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and ICH (International Committee on Harmonization) guidelines. [...] "Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) relate to quality control and quality assurance enabling companies in the pharmaceutical sector to minimize or eliminate instances of contamination, mix-ups, and errors. This in turn, protects the customer from purchasing a product which is ineffective or even dangerous." [...] These standards have historically been applied to the manufacturing environment, appropriate to how they have been written. However, according to FDA {{as well as other}} regulatory bodies, [...] "Implementation of ICH Q10 throughout the product lifecycle should <b>facilitate</b> <b>innovation</b> and continual improvement", implying that the same standards that apply to the manufacturing environment should also be applied to the clinical research space, earlier in the lifecycle of an investigational or marketed product. Accordingly, a CQMS is any system developed to apply these principles to clinical operations within an organization.|$|E
