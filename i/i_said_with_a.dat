6000|$|... "'Don't {{look like}} that, Miriam!' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little shiver. 'You {{seem to be}} looking at {{something}} a thousand miles away!' ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{corner of}} my eye in the usual quarter, towards the arts, little dreaming what destiny was to provide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, and {{bounding}} down to {{the front}} gate, where I had left my bicycle, I mounted and rode away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a desperate}} chance," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward tremor {{that was much}} like faint-heartedness, and he replied laughingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You took {{my breath}} away," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ease which <b>I</b> was {{very far from}} feeling. [...] "Remember that I have come from Braster." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Nielsen, you go ahead," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt at}} lightness. [...] "You weigh {{one hundred and}} ninety. If you go through I'll turn back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} we need fret very much if the Britishers have grown frightened," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, and Uncle 'Rasmus replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of reverential respect, [...] "fitting {{yourself}} {{for a position}} of choir-master in a Turkish cathedral, no doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He always spoke well, poor fellow," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vague amusement. [...] "And you're quite right, Tom. He was in {{business}} once and he failed--badly." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} long silence. [...] "So {{that is how}} we stand," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of having things defined. I walked slowly to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Work!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{effort at}} the heroic, and turned about <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sigh, and I {{was glad that}} the way I had to go would at least take me to my mother. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "It is granted," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{imperial}} smile. [...] "Nay, ye shall {{know the}} truth. We come from another world, {{though we are}} men such as ye; we come," [...] I went on, [...] "from the biggest star that shines at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bitter laugh. [...] "Hans, {{load the}} rifle, load it quick. Before they die there shall be another king in Zululand." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{helped her}} into the cab. [...] "Good-bye," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weak {{affectation}} of an everyday separation, and I turned to the cabman with her instructions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear lady,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little laugh, 'I {{assure you}} that I have forgiven you entirely. After all, it was not such a very serious matter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then for {{the sake}} of your daughter," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enthusiasm that was not in the least assumed, [...] "I can assure you that, whether as host or guest, you are very welcome to sit at my table. As for this packet--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I gazed {{back at her}} as {{straight}} as I dared. [...] "Ida," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attempt at firmness, [...] "I don't mean to propose to you again at all. At least, I didn't mean to when I started this morning. I think I thought I had decided not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't despair, ma'am," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> insinuating {{mildness}} {{which seemed}} to touch her. [...] "I have heard a mysterious conversation--I know of a guilty appointment--and I expect great things from my peep-hole and my pipe-hole to-night. Pray don't be alarmed, but I think {{we are on the}} brink of a discovery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> modest {{acquiescence}} in {{an assertion}} which I {{felt to be}} so much to my credit. But I blushed for its untruth.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} marriages," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touch of our {{national}} humor, [...] "that do not quite fill the bill, but that is certainly our ideal of marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, [...] "the Celebrity has {{got himself}} into {{no end of}} a predicament now. He may go back to New York in custody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There can't be a {{great deal}} of it for the Britishers, if their {{smallest}} force is three hundred, for they'd make short work of us," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward quaking. [...] "I've been blaming the lieutenant for making us march so swiftly, and now I wish he had pushed us on twice as fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{remembered that}} French Frank had treated Johnny the day I bought the Razzle Dazzle. The glasses were filled {{and we were}} ready to drink. [...] "Have {{something}} yourself, Johnny," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of having intended to say it all the time, but of having been a trifle remiss because of the interesting conversation I had been holding with Clam and Pat.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon, his vanity {{being all}} aroused, the Chevalier set himself to {{paraphrase}} all that <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heat that cast mine into a miserable insignificance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, [...] "a good Radical shouldn't {{talk like}} that." [...] For me the {{bitterness}} was over, and, knowing the worst, I {{could afford to}} laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I didn't know," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grin. [...] "That's rather {{unusual for}} a sailor. They always seemed to me the least vindictive body {{of men in the}} world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me, Poirot," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sigh, [...] "I {{think you}} have {{explained}} everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John {{and his wife are}} reconciled." ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{beautiful}} she looked, {{standing there}} with her eyes so near to mine! [...] "Tell me why, Edra?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> still <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lingering apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... "We didn't {{open fire}} any too soon," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> perhaps <b>a</b> tinge {{of pride in}} my tone because I had played my part well, as it seemed to me.|$|R
6000|$|I halted for {{a moment}} at the sight, and found the keen {{scrutiny}} of a fellow trooper upon me. [...] "No good waiting for him," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affectation of indifference. But all through the night I saw him again, and marvelled at the stupendous absurdity of such a death. I was a little feverish, I remember, and engaged in an interminable theological argument with myself, why when a man is dead he should leave so queer and irrelevant a thing as a body to decay....|$|R
6000|$|... "Go," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile, turning my horse's {{head up the}} {{right-hand}} path toward the Vaudoux temple. [...] "I am not afraid. I will come back again to Maisonette to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't seem {{possible}} that we can accomplish very much," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long drawn sigh; [...] "but we must do as he would {{if one of us}} was missing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> note of irony, when he paused. [...] "Go on. Tell me some more. Where did you {{say they}} have taken her; let us have it right." ...|$|E
6000|$|After that night, {{an hour of}} {{each evening}} that {{remained}} to him was devoted to his ease or pleasure. He could not talk much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers; but from occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection and respect I felt for him. Once {{he asked me to}} write a letter, and as I settled pen and paper, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> irrepressible glimmer of feminine curiosity, [...] "Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, John?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Liberty {{under the}} law," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{unexpected}} approving murmur from Margaret, {{and took up}} the defence. [...] "The old Liberal definition of liberty was a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal restrictions {{are not the only}} enemies of liberty. An uneducated, underbred, and underfed propertyless man {{is a man who has}} lost the possibility of liberty. There's no liberty worth a rap for him. A man who is swimming hopelessly for life wants nothing but the liberty to get out of the water; he'll give every other liberty for it--until he gets out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you should}} call it absurd," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> smiling <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of superiority. [...] "I arrived here in a {{perfectly}} comfortable condition, neither heated nor wearied." ...|$|R
