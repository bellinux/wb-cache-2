TWEAK activates the Fn 14 receptor, and may regulate cell death, survival and proliferation in tumor cells. However, there is little information on the function and regulation of this system in prostate cancer. Fn 14 expression and TWEAK actions were studied in two human prostate cancer cell lines, the androgen-independent PC- 3 cell line and androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Additionally, the expression of Fn 14 was analyzed in human biopsies of prostate cancer. Fn 14 expression is increased in histological sections of human prostate adenocarcinoma. Both prostate cancer cell lines express constitutively Fn 14, but, the androgen-independent cell line PC- 3 showed higher levels of Fn 14 that the LNCaP cells. Fn 14 expression was up-regulated in PC- 3 human prostate cancer cells in presence of inflammatory cytokines (TNFa/IFNc) as well as in presence of <b>bovine</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>serum.</b> TWEAK induced apoptotic cell death in PC- 3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells.

40|$|Autoantibodies against {{chromatin}} are {{the most}} characteristic serological feature in SLE patients. Anti-dsDNA and nucleosome-specific antibodies are associated with glomerulonephritis, the most serious manifestation of SLE. Identification of peptides mimicking conformational epitopes (so-called mimotopes) on the nucleosome recognized by these antibodies is of considerable interest. Using an approach {{similar to that used}} previously to characterize mimotopes for anti-DNA autoantibodies, we have selected and identified a mimotope for a nucleosome-specific autoantibody (# 32) by screening a random peptide phage display library. However, the reactivity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) # 32 with the selected mimotope (MIMO# 0) in ELISA was dependent on the blocking reagents used. Using nonfat dry milk (5 %), mAb # 32 clearly bound to MIMO# 0, but using <b>fetal</b> <b>bovine</b> calf <b>serum</b> (FCS) (5 %), there was no binding. Furthermore, again dependent on the blocking reagent used in ELISA, the selected mimotope MIMO# 0 was not only recognized by the selecting antibody mAb # 32, but also by a large number of other monoclonal anti-DNA, anti-histone and nucleosome-specific autoantibodies (NSA). We could demonstrate that the selected mimotope was able to bind directly to nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes) and labeled DNA. This finding was extended to other previously identified mimotopes for anti-DNA autoantibodies. We conclude that nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes), derived from reagents used during the mimotope selection procedure, resulted in the selection of DNA-binding peptides from the phage display library, rather than mimotopes. In addition, we could demonstrate that blocking reagents greatly influence the reactivity of anti-DNA, anti-histone and nucleosome-specific autoantibodies in ELISA. Development of blocking reagents devoid of nucleosomal material (DNA/histone complexes) is urgently needed for assay systems in which anti-nuclear autoantibodies are tested...|$|R
