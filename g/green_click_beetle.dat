40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{a plethora}} of bioluminescent {{reporter}} genes being cloned and used for cell assays and molecular imaging purposes, the simultaneous monitoring of multiple events in small animals is still challenging. This is partly attributable {{to the lack of}} optimization of cell reporter gene expression as well as too much spectral overlap of the color-coupled reporter genes. A new red emitting codon-optimized luciferase reporter gene mutant of Photinus pyralis, Ppy RE 8, has been developed and used in combination with the <b>green</b> <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> luciferase, CBG 99. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were transfected with vectors that expressed red Ppy RE 8 and green CBG 99 luciferases. Populations of red and green emitting cells were mixed in different ratios. After addition of the shared single substrate, D-luciferin, bioluminescent (BL) signals were imaged with an ultrasensitive cooled CCD camera using a series of band pass filters (20 nm). Spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to the images where good separation of signals was observed. Furthermore, HEK 293 cells that expressed the two luciferases were injected at different depth in the animals. Spectrally-separate images and quantification of the dual BL signals in a mixed population of cells was achieved when cells were either injected subcutaneously or directly into the prostate. SIGNIFICANCE: We report here the re-engineering of different luciferase genes for in vitro and in vivo dual color imaging applications to address the technical issues of using dual luciferases for imaging. In respect to previously used dual assays, our study demonstrated enhanced sensitivity combined with spatially separate BL spectral emissions using a suitable spectral unmixing algorithm. This new D-luciferin-dependent reporter gene couplet opens up the possibility in the future for more accurate quantitative gene expression studies in vivo by simultaneously monitoring two events in real time...|$|E
40|$|SummaryUnderstanding the {{functional}} complexity of protein interactions requires mapping biomolecular complexes within the cellular environment over biologically relevant time scales. Herein, we describe a set of reversible multicolored heteroprotein complementation fragments based on various firefly and click beetle luciferases that utilize the same substrate, D-luciferin. Luciferase heteroprotein fragment complementation systems enabled dual-color quantification of two discrete pairs of interacting proteins simultaneously or two distinct proteins interacting {{with a third}} shared protein in live cells. Using real-time analysis of <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> <b>green</b> and <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> red luciferase heteroprotein fragment complementation applied to β-TrCP, an E 3 -ligase common to the regulation of both β-catenin and IκBα, GSK 3 β {{was identified as a}} candidate kinase regulating IκBα processing. These dual-color protein interaction switches may enable directed dynamic analysis of a variety of protein interactions in living cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} pheromones of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> was {{started with the}} {{objective}} of applying similar methods in IPM strategies for the control of wireworms, based on the similar experience gained from the widely used moth pheromones. A brief overview is presented on the identification of <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> pheromones, new questions arising in the categorization of these pheromones into sex or aggregation pheromones, options for the development of female-targeted lures, and application perspectives. The implementation of IPM strategies against wireworms, the larvae of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Elateridae), has been very difficult because of the time- and energyconsuming detection and development of monitoring methods. It was reasonable to believe that—similar to Lepidoptera—if pheromones of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> became known, they could assist in the development of simple and easy-to-use tools and methods for this purpose.

40|$|Wireworms, {{the larvae}} of Agriotes spp., are an {{increasing}} problem on many organically managed farms with potato or vegetable production. The {{damage caused by}} wireworms is economically significant. With the use of pheromone traps {{it is possible to}} get more information about the habitat requirements of <b>click</b> <b>beetles.</b> In 2005 and 2006 <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> were monitored at different locations in northern Germany. Because of the warmer springtime in 2005, the first peak of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> was about two weeks earlier than in 2006. The second peak was found one month later. The presented data show the highest occurrence of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in ryegrass-clover mixtures in both years. The catches in cereals were much lower than in ryegrass-clover. The reasons for the differences of the trapped <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in the different cereal fields cannot been explained so far. In the majority of cases the trapped number of Agriotes lineatus was higher than for A. obscurus...|$|R
