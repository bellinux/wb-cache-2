I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital telephone sets has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a transoesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TOE) image acquisition protocol which provides a systematic manner of acquiring a minimal number of overlapping 3 D TOE datasets allowing the reconstruction of a wide 3 D view of the left atrium (LA) with anatomical landmarks that are important for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation. Methods: In eight cardiac surgical patients, 3 D TOE datasets were acquired with a six-step protocol. In the protocol, step 1 aims to acquire the central view of the mitral valve (MV), aortic valve (AV) and left atrial appendage (LAA). Step 2 was developed to acquire the left pulmonary veins (PVs) and step 3 to acquire the right PVs. Steps 4, 5 and 6 were developed to create a sufficient overlap between different datasets. 3 D TOE datasets were registered and fused manually in end diastole. Results: The image acquisition protocol was feasible in all patients. In the fused 3 D dataset, a wide 3 D view of the LA is shown, and left and right PVs could be seen simultaneously. The LAA, MV, AV and fossa ovalis (FO) were visualised clearly in the 3 D TOE datasets. The PV ostia, which are located at the edges of the 3 D datasets, suffered more from the artefact of <b>echo</b> <b>loss.</b> The volume overlaps between neighbouring TOE datasets were 50 - 75 %. Conclusion: The major part of the LA anatomy incorporating the PVs, LAA, MV, AV and FO as important anatomical landmarks can be reconstructed by registering and fusing 3 D datasets acquired with the six-step TOE image acquisition protocol. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [93]- 94) In telecommunication, {{the echo}} canceler using an adaptive filter {{is the most}} effective technique for controlling echoes. Because the precision of speech detection significantly affects how the echo path is modeled, this thesis presents the structures of two echo cancelers and two speech detectors. Of the two echo cancelers, one is based on <b>echo</b> path <b>loss</b> (EPL) of 6 dB and the other uses two different echo path models. The speech detectors using a three variable-length windows technique are implemented as the far-end speech detector. Double-talk detectors based on EPL and <b>echo</b> return <b>loss</b> enhancement (ERLE) are also developed and evaluated. Different adaptation algorithms on the adaptive filter are discussed. The normalized partial block least-mean-square (NPBLMS) algorithm is discussed and compared with the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm. The results show that the former algorithm achieves a better performance. The center clipper is also introduced and implemented to compress the residual echo. The overall programs have been implemented on the digital signal processor TMS 320 C 54 x, where the partial maximum algorithm is also developed for the echo canceler in order to save more computation on DSP program.

40|$|Understory {{trees in}} {{multilayered}} stands are often ignored in forest inventories. Information about them would benefit silviculture, wood procurement, and biodiversity management. Cost-efficient inventory methods are needed and airborne LiDAR is a promising addition to fieldwork. The overstory, however, obstructs wall-to-wall {{sampling of the}} understory using LiDAR, because transmission losses affect echotriggering probabilities and intensity (peak amplitude) observations. We examined the potential of LiDAR in mapping of understory trees in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands (62 °N, 24 °E), using careful experimentation. We formulated a conceptual model for the transmission losses and illustrated that loss normalization is highly ill-posed, especially for vegetation. The losses skew the population of targets that produce a subsequent <b>echo.</b> <b>Losses</b> up to 10 – 15 % can occur even if an overstory echo is not triggered. In LiDAR sensors, quantized intensity values start from binary zero, but actually should include an offset, the noise level. We estimated these empirically. Constraining to low-loss pulses and ground data, we estimated parameters for compensation models that {{were based on the}} radar equation and employed the geometry of the pulse, as well as the overstory intensity observations as predictors. Intensity variation of second-return data was reduced, but, the intensity data were deemed of low value in species discrimination. Our results highlight differences between sensors in near-ground echo-triggering and height data. Area-based LiDAR height metrics from the understory had reasonable correlation with the density and mean height of the understory trees, whereas tree species seemed out of reach even if the transmission losses were compensated for. We conclude that transmission losses are a general impediment for radiometric analysis of multi-echo pulses in discrete- return and waveform LiDAR data...|$|R
