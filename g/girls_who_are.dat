Students have a personal tutor to discuss their progress, and boarding students have a house parent who communicates with parents at home.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E

25|$|These {{plants and}} trees are still {{used in the}} Art of Tuvalu to make {{traditional}} artwork and handicraft. Tuvaluan women continue to make Te titi tao, which is a traditional skirt made of dried pandanus leaves that are dyed using Tongo (Rhizophora mucronata) and Nonu (Morinda citrifolia). The art of making a titi tao is passed down from Fafinematua (elder woman) to the Tamaliki Fafine (young <b>girls)</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> preparing for their first Fatele.|$|E
25|$|Organized criminals can {{generate}} {{up to several}} thousand dollars per day from one trafficked girl, and the Internet has further increased profitability of sex trafficking and child trafficking. With faster access to a wider clientele, more sexual encounters can be scheduled. Victims and clients, according to a New York City report on sex trafficking in minors, increasingly use the Internet to meet customers. Because of protests, Craigslist has since closed its adult services section. According to authorities, Backpage is now the main source for advertising trafficking victims. Investigators also frequently browse online classified ads to identify potential underage <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trafficked.|$|E

25|$|In rural areas, {{schools have}} been {{reported}} to have gained the improved sanitation facility. Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys. Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others. Access to sanitation in some parts of northern India is very poor: about 85% of the rural households in Bihar have no access to a toilet; and this creates a dangerous situation for women and <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> followed, attacked and raped in the fields.|$|E
25|$|Assuming and {{initiating}} {{care has}} been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy (aloha). As children mature within the family, they go {{through a process of}} having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.|$|E
25|$|The Historical Characters line of 18-inch dolls were {{initially}} {{the main focus}} of Pleasant Company, which {{were initially}} derived from the 18-inch dolls made by Götz in Germany during the late 1980s to the 1990s. This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six-book series {{from the perspective of a}} girl living in that time period. Although the books are written for <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at least eight years old, they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, animal abuse and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities of their young audience.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the {{cultural}} practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) {{is known to}} impact women's health, though {{is difficult to know}} the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a Sub-Saharan African practice, it may have roots in the Middle East as well. The estimated 3 million <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects. Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention. Long-term consequences include urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding. Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) than women who have not.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
