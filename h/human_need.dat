25|$|The <b>human</b> <b>need</b> for art, on this view, {{stems from}} the need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers {{a way out of this}} dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E

The case study involved 18 international students and 22 academic and support staff members. Ethnography and content analysis for interviews during three phases yielded results that apply to Hofstede and Hofstede’s (2005) Cultural Dimensions Model, Devito’s (2004) Culture Shock Model, and Maslow’s (1954, 1970, and 1984) Hierarchy for <b>Human</b> <b>Needs.</b> The foregoing structures joined Western pedagogy in Liberal Secular Ideology to generate the Culture, <b>Human</b> <b>Needs,</b> and Western Pedagogy Model (CHNP).

First, <b>human</b> <b>needs</b> may exist across cultures, but the process for satisfying <b>human</b> <b>needs</b> is culture specific.

Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of [...] "resource wars". This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries, and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|According to Payne, Le Guin {{does not}} {{explicitly}} criticize {{the concept of}} religion in general, but the tendency within religion to reduce [...] "reality" [...] to that which can be contained and controlled by the human mind. This [...] "control" [...] is only possible within the entirely human-made environment aboard the spacecraft, which Le Guin depicts as lacking elements of the [...] "richly textured" [...] real world, and which denies human beings the experiences of [...] "wildness" [...] which make life interesting. In Payne's view the story challenges the idea, common to Western society, that human beings, and technology, can solve all problems; it does so by presenting an entire planet as a system not amenable to control. A 2002 review in Salon magazine also highlighted the religious themes in the story, stating that Le Guin offered an unusual take {{on the theme of}} religion by depicting a [...] "cult of atheists" [...] fed by the tendency to religious conformity among human beings. Scholar Max Haiven also said that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] demonstrated the <b>human</b> <b>need</b> for myth and spirituality, {{and the ways in which}} power structures could arise even in societies planned with the intent of avoiding them. According to Haiven, the zeroth generation made the mistake of assuming that they could create a completely rational society; instead, the emerging system of religion brought with it coercion and patriarchal standards of behavior.|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Health, Wealth and Happiness, theologians David Jones and Russell Woodbridge {{characterize}} the doctrine as poor theology. They suggest that righteousness cannot be earned {{and that the}} Bible does not promise an easy life. They {{argue that it is}} inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus and propose that the central message of the gospel should be Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Jones and Woodbridge see Jesus' importance as vital, criticizing the prosperity gospel for marginalizing him in favor of a focus on <b>human</b> <b>need.</b> In another article, Jones criticizes the prosperity theology interpretation of the Abrahamic covenant, God's promise to bless Abraham's descendants, arguing that this blessing is spiritual and should already apply to all Christians. He also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life and criticizes John Avanzini's teaching that Jesus was wealthy as a misrepresentation, noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up their material possessions. Although he accepts giving as [...] "praiseworthy", he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the [...] "Law of Compensation", which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will give back more in return. Rather, Jones cites Jesus' teaching to [...] "give, hoping for nothing in return." [...] Jones and Woodbridge also note that Jesus instructed followers to focus on spiritual rewards, citing his command in Matthew 6:19–20 [...] "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" [...] (KJV). Jones criticizes the doctrine's view of faith: he does not believe that it should be used as a spiritual force for material gain but seen as selfless acceptance of God.|$|E
500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the <b>human</b> <b>need</b> for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E
