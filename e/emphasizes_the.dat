5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|In aikido, {{specific}} muscles or {{muscle groups}} are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates. For example, many dojos begin each class with , which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} of early science and medicine Paula Findlen, {{writing in the}} Cambridge History of Science, calls De Materia Medica [...] "one {{of the most successful}} and enduring herbals of antiquity, [...] <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency", in contrast to Pliny's Natural History (which <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> wonders of nature) or the natural history studies of Aristotle and Theophrastus (which <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> causes of natural phenomena).|$|R
5|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> {{importance of}} personal empowerment, proposing {{that it is}} God's will for his people to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This {{is believed to be}} achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E
5|$|The {{politics}} {{within the}} poem <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> problems within British politics and expresses Coleridge's views that the conservatives were warmongering {{and that there}} was corruption within the government. Although he feels this way, he still feels loyalty to the country and wants the British to be safe regardless of their problems.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it {{presented}} casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "VaR" [...] is {{used both}} for a risk measure and a risk metric. This {{sometimes}} leads to confusion. Sources earlier than 1995 usually <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> risk measure, later sources {{are more likely}} to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> metric.|$|R

Based on the curriculum established by the Society of Jesus in the sixteenth century, the Core is shared by Jesuit schools {{all over the world}} and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> liberal arts as a basis of education.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{outreach}} {{efforts are}} coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, {{which was established}} in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The Hubble Heritage Project, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images {{of the most interesting}} and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.|$|E

5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> integration of the mitochondria, {{the product of an}} endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The State Emblem {{was adopted}} in 1954 and symbolizes Pakistan's ideological foundation, {{the basis of}} its economy, its {{cultural}} heritage and its guiding principles. The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above a shield, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll. The crest and the green colour of the emblem are traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and signify the agricultural base of the economy. The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, represents the floral designs used in traditional Mughal art and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> cultural heritage of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|The play The Reckoning of Kit and Little Boots, by Nat Cassidy, {{examines}} {{the lives of}} the Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe and Caligula, with the fictional conceit that Marlowe was working on a play about Caligula around the time of his own murder. It <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> similarities between the two charactersâ€”both stabbed to death at 29, both in part {{as a result of their}} controversial religious perspectives. The play focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family membersâ€”by default, a wife and two childrenâ€”being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game <b>emphasizes.</b> <b>The</b> player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada, and international students {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in marking schemes. In 2016, 44 percent of applications to full-time, first-year studies were accepted. In 2013, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Queen's was 89% overall, with the Commerce, Education and Engineering faculties having the highest entrance averages at 91.7%, 90.8%, and 90.6% respectively. The application process <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> mandatory Personal Statement of Experience (PSE). The statement expresses how the applicant's personal experiences may contribute to the university. It focuses on qualifications and involvement outside of academics and is an important factor in determining admission. Several faculties require applicants to submit a supplementary essay.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|This {{concentration}} is offered {{in partnership with}} Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Pastoral Care Department (RWJUH). Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min. Concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling.|$|E
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
