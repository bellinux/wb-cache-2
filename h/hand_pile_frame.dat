40|$|The {{research}} {{made for}} the purpose of completing the at hand dissertation is directed towards the second stage of the construction of a near shore jetty, namely the positioning and installation of the inclined piles that will support the whole structure. A number of printed books, articles in journals and reliable internet sources were assessed prior to conducting the methodology analysis for the dissertation. As the literature research grew, it became more and more clear that experts on the field were focusing their studies on the different types of piles, the various items of piling equipment and later the possible installation methods of general application. Moreover, noise control in construction sites is nowadays a matter of increasing importance due to the global turn towards the environmental safety and {{the health and safety of}} the people. Whereas most would find the subject complete from a Civil Engineer point of view, a Surveyor would object; an essential aspect of the installation process is to come up with a way to accurately position the <b>piling</b> <b>frame</b> that will guide the pile to the correct position. The greater the magnitude of the project and the more piling work at sea, the greater the challenge. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of the project in positional tolerances, one would consider a new model of <b>piling</b> <b>frame,</b> one with the element of flexibility in micro – movements, rather than trying to achieve the aforementioned accuracy by positioning the marine barge. In that sense, a need arose for trying to explain the positioning scheme of a <b>piling</b> <b>frame</b> with GPS technology, as well as to explain the mechanics of this new <b>piling</b> <b>frame</b> model, in order to bring a steel pile to the correct place and orientation. The research initiated in the context of fulfilling the requirements for the Master of Science degree of “MSc Hydrography” programme at Plymouth University, Devon, UK. The proposal is an essential part of the “Vassilikos Jetty Marine Works” project that took place in Vassilikos area, Cyprus and was completed under the efforts of the engineers and land/ marine crew of ARCHIMEDES S. A., a Heavy Marine and Civil Contractor in Greece. The Client was J&P Group and the project was successfully completed after almost 18 months...|$|R
