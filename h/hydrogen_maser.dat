25|$|The onboard passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> and {{rubidium}} clocks {{are very}} stable {{over a few}} hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so {{they need to be}} synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} sixties, Ramsey and Daniel Kleppner used a Stern–Gerlach system {{to produce a}} beam of {{polarized}} hydrogen {{as the source of}} energy for the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>Maser,</b> which {{is still one of the}} most popular atomic clocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{observatory}} is also {{equipped with}} a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> that maintains time standard stability to one part in 1015 {{in order to facilitate}} data correlation. The facility provides educational field schools for students from junior high to postdoctoral training programs including York University's space engineering field school. By appointment ARO is open to visitors.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} stable {{frequency}} references {{in the world are}} cesium standards, including cesium fountains, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers.</b> Cesium standards are widely recognized as having better long-term stability, whereas <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> can attain superior short-term performance; therefore, several national standards laboratories use ensembles of cesium standards and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> in order to combine the best attributes of both.|$|R
40|$|Historical cost curves were {{developed}} for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> and cesium beam standards used for frequency and timing calibration in the Deep Space Network. These curves {{may be used}} to calculate the cost of future <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> or cesium beam standards in either future or current dollars. The cesium beam standards are decreasing in cost by about 2. 3 % per year since 1966, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> are decreasing by about 0. 8 % per year since 1978 relative to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration inflation index...|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of primary}} time, (i.e., {{frequency}} standards) are caesium standards and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers.</b>|$|R
25|$|In January 2017, news {{agencies}} {{reported that}} {{six of the}} passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> {{and three of the}} rubidium atomic clocks had failed. Four of the full operational satellites have each lost at least one clock; but no satellite has lost more than two. The operation of the constellation has not been affected as each satellite is launched with three spare clocks. The possibility of a systematic flaw is being considered.|$|E
25|$|According to European sources ESA took {{measures}} to correct both identified sets of problems by replacing a faulty component {{that can cause}} a short circuit in the rubidium clocks and improve the passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clocks as well on satellites still to be launched. However, in August 2017, ISRO also faced clock failures, and these atomic clocks {{were said to be}} supplied by European supplier under a 4-million-euro deal.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser,</b> the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E

40|$|Application of a dc {{magnetic}} field on an RF hydrogen gas dissociator {{led to the}} development of a more efficient source of atoms for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers.</b> The influence of the applied {{magnetic field}} on the plasma and some details of the resulting enhancement of the dissociation efficiency are discussed. Ways that this improved efficiency can result in the enhancement of the operation and field life of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers,</b> as well as aid the development of spaceborne masers, are considered...|$|R
40|$|Very low {{temperature}} atomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> were developed. The advantages over room temperature <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> include higher radiated power {{due to the}} higher beam intensities possible using {{low temperature}} techniques and the much smaller electron spin flip cross section at low temperatures, lower cavity and amplifier noise temperatures, increased stability against mechanical creep at low temperatures, and opportunities to extend H atom collision studies to low temperatures, where quantum effects and details of the interatomic potentials are much more important...|$|R
25|$|In 1962 it was {{selected}} as the site for the Algonquin 46m radio telescope, which has been the site's primary instrument through most of its history. An earlier 10m instrument was set up in 1961 though was not equipped with a drive mechanism until 1964. The site also hosts a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser,</b> a standard feature for radio telescopes that can also serve to receive telemetry from deep space missions. Other instruments formerly at the site included a solar-observing array of thirty-two 10ft (3m) dishes, and a single 1.8m solar flux monitor observing at 10.7cm wavelength, and a 18m radio telescope from the University of Toronto.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey and his PhD student Daniel Kleppner {{developed}} the atomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser,</b> looking {{to increase the}} accuracy with which the hyperfine separations of atomic hydrogen, deuterium and tritium could be measured, {{as well as to}} investigate how much the hyperfine structure was affected by external magnetic and electric fields. He also participated in developing an extremely stable clock based on a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser.</b> Since 1967, the second has been defined based on [...] 9,192,631,770 [...] hyperfine transition of a cesium-133 atom; the atomic clock which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey's work. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 [...] "for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> and other atomic clocks". The Prize was shared with Hans G. Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul.|$|E
2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks {{which are}} independent of one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> the secondary <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft {{navigation}} to {{the outer}} planets (Jupiter and beyond) places very stringent demands upon the performance of frequency and time (F&T) reference standards.

2500|$|... {{the most}} {{important}} type of maser is the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> which is currently used as an atomic frequency standard. Together with other kinds of atomic clocks, these help make up the International Atomic Time standard ("Temps Atomique International" [...] or [...] "TAI" [...] in French).

2500|$|The blueshift of {{a falling}} photon {{can be found}} by {{assuming}} it has an equivalent mass based on its frequency [...] (where h is Planck's constant) along with , a result of special relativity. Such simple derivations {{ignore the fact that}} in general relativity the experiment compares clock rates, rather than energies. In other words, the [...] "higher energy" [...] of the photon after it falls can be equivalently ascribed to the slower running of clocks deeper in the gravitational potential well. To fully validate general relativity, it is important to also show that the rate of arrival of the photons is greater than the rate at which they are emitted. A very accurate gravitational redshift experiment, which deals with this issue, was performed in 1976, where a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>maser</b> clock on a rocket was launched to a height of 10,000km, and its rate compared with an identical clock on the ground. It tested the gravitational redshift to 0.007%.|$|E

40|$|Through {{the past}} 17 years, the time scale {{requirements}} at the National Research Council (NRC) {{have been met}} by the unsteered output of its primary laboratory cesium clocks, supplemented by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> when short-term stability better than 2 x 10 (exp - 12) tau(sup - 1 / 2) has been required. NRC now operates three primary laboratory cesium clocks, three <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers,</b> and two commercial cesium clocks. NRC has been using ensemble averages for internal purposes {{for the past several}} years, and has a realtime algorithm operating on the outputs of its high-resolution (2 x 10 (exp - 13) s at 1 s) phase comparators. The slow frequency drift of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>masers</b> has presented difficulties in incorporating their short-term stability into the ensemble average, while retaining the long-term stability of the laboratory cesium frequency standards. We report on this work on algorithms for an inhomogeneous ensemble of atomic clocks, and on our initial work on time scale algorithms that could incorporate frequency calibrations at NRC from the next generation of Zacharias fountain cesium frequency standards having frequency accuracies that might surpass 10 (exp - 15), or from single-trapped-ion frequency standards (Ba+, Sr+, [...] .) with even higher potential accuracies. The requirements for redundancy in all the elements (including the algorithms) of an inhomogeneous ensemble that would give a robust real-time output of the algorithms are presented and discussed...|$|R
