It is assumed that the advance rate of the crystal surface depends solely on the surface orientation, which implies that the classical kinematic wave theory applies. We present an algorithm to calculate the <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> at any given point in time in a single time step for initial <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> that are either completely convex or completely concave. We show that calculation of the <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> for mixed convex/concave <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> may require a series of time steps. Boundary conditions imposed at imperfections in the crystal surface or at boundaries with a container wall or a mask are treated. The possibility of two or more disconnected <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> that meet {{at some point in their}} evolution is also taken into account.

40|$|Ice {{crystals}} {{in clouds}} {{exist in a}} virtually limitless variation of geometries. The most basic <b>shapes</b> of ice <b>crystals</b> are columnar or plate-like hexagonal prisms with aspect ratios determined by relative humidity and temperature. However, crystals in ice clouds generally display more complex structures owing to aggregation, riming and growth histories through varying temperature and humidity regimes. <b>Crystal</b> <b>shape</b> is relevant for cloud evolution as it affects microphysical properties such as fall speeds and aggregation efficiency. Furthermore, the scattering properties of ice crystals are affected by their general shape, {{as well as by}} microscopic features such as surface roughness, impurities and internal structure. To improve the representation of ice clouds in climate models, increased understanding of the global variation of <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> and how it relates to, e. g., location, cloud temperature and atmospheric state is crucial. Here, the remote sensing of ice crystal macroscale and microscale structure from airborne and space-based lidar depolarization observations and multi-directional measurements of total and polarized reflectances is reviewed. In addition, a brief overview is given of in situ and laboratory observations of ice <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> as well as the optical properties of ice crystals that serve as foundations for the remote sensing approaches. Lidar depolarization is generally found to increase with increasing cloud height and to vary with latitude. Although this variation is generally linked to the variation of ice <b>crystal</b> <b>shape,</b> the interpretation of the depolarization remains largely qualitative and more research is needed before quantitative conclusions about ice shape can be deduced. The angular variation of total and polarized reflectances of ice clouds has been analyzed by numerous studies in order to infer information about ice <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> from them. From these studies it is apparent that pristine crystals with smooth surfaces are generally inconsistent with the data and thus crystal impurity, distortion or surface roughness is prevalent. However, conclusions about the dominating ice shapes are often inconclusive and contradictory and are highly dependent on the limited selection of shapes included in the investigations. Since ice crystal optical properties are mostly determined by the aspect ratios of the crystal components and their microscale structure, it is advised that remote sensing applications focus on the variation of these ice shape characteristics, rather than on the macroscale shape or habit. Recent studies use databases with nearly continuous ranges of crystal component aspect ratio and-or roughness levels to infer the variation of ice <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> from satellite and airborne remote sensing measurements. Here, the rationale and results of varying strategies for the remote sensing of ice <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> are reviewed. Observed systematic variations of ice crystal geometry with location, cloud height and atmospheric state suggested by the data are discussed. Finally, a prospective is given {{on the future of the}} remote sensing of ice cloud particle shapes...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in deriving the silicate mineralogy of comets is ascertaining how the anisotropic nature of forsterite crystals affects the spectral features' wavelength, relative intensity, and asymmetry. Forsterite features are identified in cometary comae near 10, 11. 05 - 11. 2, 16, 19, 23. 5, 27. 5 and 33 microns [1 - 10], so accurate models for forsterite's absorption efficiency (Qabs) are a primary requirement to compute IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs, lambdaF lambda vs. lambda) and constrain the silicate mineralogy of comets. Forsterite is an anisotropic crystal, with three crystallographic axes with distinct indices of refraction for the a-, b-, and c-axis. The {{shape of a}} forsterite crystal significantly affects its spectral features [13 - 16]. We need models that account for <b>crystal</b> <b>shape.</b> The IR absorption efficiencies of forsterite are computed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) code DDSCAT [11, 12]. Starting from a fiducial <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> of a cube, we systematically elongate/reduce one of the crystallographic axes. Also, we elongate/reduce one axis while the lengths {{of the other two}} axes are slightly asymmetric (0. 8 : 1. 2). The most significant grain shape characteristic that affects the crystalline spectral features is the relative lengths of the crystallographic axes. The second significant grain shape characteristic is breaking the symmetry of all three axes [17]. Synthetic spectral energy distributions using seven <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> classes [17] are fit to the observed SED of comet C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp). The Hale-Bopp crystalline residual better matches equant, b-platelets, c-platelets, and b-columns spectral shape classes, while a-platelets, a-columns and c-columns worsen the spectral fits. Forsterite condensation and partial evaporation experiments demonstrate that environmental temperature and grain shape are connected [18 - 20]. Thus, grain shape is a potential probe for protoplanetary disk temperatures where the cometary crystalline forsterite formed. The forsterite <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> (equant, b-platelets, c-platelets, b-columns - excluding a- and c-columns) derived from our modeling [17] of comet Hale- Bopp, compared to laboratory synthesis experiments [18], suggests that these crystals are high temperature condensates.
