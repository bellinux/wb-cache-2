5|$|A {{document}} of Inchaffray Abbey, {{preserved in the}} original (as opposed to a later copy), recorded that Bishop Walter {{had been involved in}} settling a dispute involving Inchaffray, an abbey which lay in his diocese. Inchaffray's dispute was with Naomhán Mac Eóghainn (Nevin MacEwen) and his wife Mairead (Mariota). Under Abbot Symon de Scone, previous Abbot of Inchaffray, the abbey had <b>given</b> <b>some</b> lands in exchange for 40marks to Mairead's father Maol Mhuire (Malmoran) of Glencarnie.|$|E
5|$|The threats {{faced by}} seabirds {{have not gone}} unnoticed by {{scientists}} or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced {{of the need to}} declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are <b>given</b> <b>some</b> measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Verbal {{derivation}} {{is extremely}} productive, and Greenlandic employs {{many hundreds of}} derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are <b>given</b> <b>some</b> examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.|$|E

5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is <b>given.</b> <b>Some</b> wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E
5|$|Katniss and Peeta {{are taken}} to the Capitol. In the {{few days before the}} Games start, they are advised and {{supported}} by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, <b>given</b> <b>some</b> training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{was the son}} of Ralph de Neville, a son of Alan de Neville, who {{was also}} Chief Forester. Hugh had a brother, Roger de Neville, who was part of Hugh's {{household}} from 1202 to 1213, when Roger was given custody of Rockingham Castle by King John. Another brother was William, who was <b>given</b> <b>some</b> of Hugh's lands in 1217. Hugh, Roger, and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen, most notable among them Geoffrey de Neville, who was a royal chamberlain, and Ralph Neville, who became Bishop of Chichester. Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph's career, and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh's life.|$|E

5|$|Prior to forming Taxiride, Tim Watson, Tim Wild, Jason Singh, and Dan Hall {{had each}} played in cover bands across Melbourne. Watson and Wild began writing {{together}} in 1997 in Camberwell, Melbourne, and soon recruited Singh {{as an additional}} vocalist. The trio invited Hall, whom Wild first encountered busking, to join the group, and he accepted. The band named themselves Taxiride because they had <b>given</b> <b>some</b> of their early work {{to a friend of}} theirs, a taxi driver, who had tested these songs on passengers. The group produced a demo at Melbourne's Secret Sound Studios, and used it to land a contract with Warner in Australia. Meanwhile, a friend of the group passed their work onto a Sire Records executive in the U.S., who signed them despite the group being unknown.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have <b>given</b> <b>some</b> demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E
5|$|The Lion King {{tells the}} story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is {{manipulated}} into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is <b>given</b> <b>some</b> valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.|$|E

5|$|The NZGB {{encourages}} {{the use of}} original Māori names and has <b>given</b> <b>some</b> places official double names. These can be expressed as alternative names where officially either name could be used (Mount Taranaki or Mount Egmont) or dual names where both names should be used together (Matiu / Somes Island). In 1998, {{as a result of}} the settling of the Ngai Tahu Treaty claim, New Zealand's tallest mountain officially became Aoraki / Mount Cook. There are also a few English dual names, with Wellington harbour also officially known as Port Nicholson.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapters}} of the book covered in this episode are Bran IV (less the first few pages that {{were included in the}} previous episode), Eddard V, Jon IV, Eddard VI, Catelyn V, Sansa II, Daenerys IV (chapters 25–30 and 37). Among the scenes created for the show, there are the conversations between Theon and Tyrion, Sansa and Septa Mordane, Doreah and Viserys, Jory Cassel and Jaime, Jon and Samwell and Eddard Stark and Cersei. The character of Alliser Thorne is <b>given</b> <b>some</b> more depth by justifying his harshness towards the new recruits, and a more subdued version of Bran's dream is included.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} specimen {{was shot}} {{along with a}} bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree. Nothing else is known about its behavior. The species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953, and as several searches of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of the bird, many believe {{that it may be}} extinct. However, a local hunter from southern Negros claimed to have shot it the nineties, and the discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to Negros on the nearby island of Panay have <b>given</b> <b>some</b> hope that the species may persist. As such, it is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and hunting.|$|E

5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are <b>given</b> <b>some</b> important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Æthelwig was trusted {{by the new}} king, William the Conqueror, and <b>given</b> <b>some</b> {{administrative}} duties. Æthelwig {{was one of a}} {{very small}} number of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan. Probably in 1069, Æthelwig was given authority in the former lands of the Mercian kingdom. After the deposition of Godric, the abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in 1070, Æthelwig served as his jailor. In 1072, Æthelwig was acting as a royal judge in the western part of England. During the rebellion of 1075, Æthelwig kept Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, Æthelwig was assisted by Wulfstan, as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d'Abetot. Æthelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by redeeming loans. Æthelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Serlo, the Abbot of Gloucester. A number of English landowners commended themselves into Æthelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after Æthelwig's death.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was <b>given</b> <b>some</b> time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.|$|E

5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have <b>given</b> <b>some</b> ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston {{accompanied}} {{him from the}} other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall’s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were <b>given</b> <b>some</b> respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.|$|E
