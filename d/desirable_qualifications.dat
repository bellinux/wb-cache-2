This article explores questions concerning the scope of care management services within the chronic illness care model; optimal ways to identify depressed patients in the primary care setting; responsibilities and <b>desirable</b> <b>qualifications</b> of depression care managers; the location and manner in which care managers interact with patients; costs of services provided by care managers; {{and the level of}} supervision by mental health specialists that is necessary to ensure quality care. KEY WORDS: care management; depression; primary care. BACKGROUND Although evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care were pub-lished as early as 1993 by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, depression continues to be underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. In an ef-fort to close what the Institute of Medicine (2001) called the ‘‘quality chasm’ ’ between the usual care of chronic illnesses and the appropriate care of these illnesses, researchers have instituted numerous studies. The first wave of studies that focused on depression tried to close the chasm by giving guideline-based feedback to primary care physicians (PCPs) about their patients who required depression care. However, this single measure of feedback to PCPs did not result in significant improvement of depression recognition or treatment, nor did other single-measure interventions, {{such as the use of}} pa-tient screening or patient registries (Gilbody, House...|$|E

40|$|The present essay {{discusses}} rhetorics as {{an instrument}} of both persuasion and deception. Early Chinese political thought shows a keen awareness of the deceptive potential immanent in rhetorical skills. Multiple texts warn against certain types of rhetorical behaviour that entail a potential threat to the ruler’s control over political power. Yet, at the same time rhetorical skills were also a <b>desirable</b> <b>qualification.</b> While most texts from early China discuss rhetorical skills in general terms as an asset or a threat to the ruler’s power, some texts reflect rhetorical skills in more detail, describing specific types of rhetorical behaviour. This essay introduces examples of such texts that were probably first composed as pragmatic texts for application in political practice, before they were integrated into larger compilations or literary texts for argumentative purposes. The essay also shows that these pragmatic texts used a set of technical terms, some of which were no longer recognized in the later transmission, which often led to changes in the texts...|$|R

This study aimed to compare the realistic service and the desirable service, as well as, to explore the directions to improve the service of Psychological Lab and Counseling Center among the service recipients based on their gender, age range, and field of studies. A total sample of 150 participants were service recipients; college students, lecturers, staff during the first semester academic year 2014 until the first semester academic year 2015. The instruments used included: the Questionnaire on needs assessment of the development of Psychological Lab and Counseling Center, and a focus group discussion. Frequency distribution, percentage, means, standard deviation, and variance were used to analyze the data. The needs assessment results showed as follows: 1) Overall the realistic basis of Psychological Lab and Counseling Center service was in an “above level of needs” while “the highest level of needs” was found in the <b>desirable</b> <b>qualification.</b> After having divided into categories, the result yielded an “above level” on the realistic basis of the counselor characteristics, task planning, and facility arrangement. For the desired qualification, the results showed that the needs on the counselors’ characteristics, task planning, and facility arrangement were identified as at a highest level of needs. 2) No differences were found on the realistic basis needs of the clients, the services provided, gender, and age range of the clients although they responded differently to the questionnaire. The clients who responded to the questionnaire from different field of studies showed the different needs of services provided in the realistic basis significantly at the level of. 05 in which the General Sciences clients held different needs from Psychology clients and mathematics clients significantly at. 05 level. However no differences were found between psychology clients and mathematics clients. 3) No differences were found on the <b>desirable</b> <b>qualification</b> of the center of the clients, the services provided, gender, and age range of the clients although they responded differently to the questionnaire. 4) the Suggestions for improving the services of Psychological Lab and Counseling Center included: extensive advertising of the services provided internally and externally, increasing a number of counselors to meet the clients’ needs, improving the privacy of the services environment to protect clients’ confidentiality, improving the counseling rooms to be more private and less sounds intefering, and boosting the channels of advertisement to social network like facebook...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A LITERACY COACH???S HANDBOOK: COACHING STRATEGIES TO IMPACT STUDENT LEARNING IN THE MIDDLE GRADES by Denise Conrado Master of Arts in Education Curriculum and Instruction Option California State University, Chico Spring 2010 With the {{increasing}} focus on reading achievement {{over the past}} decade at federal, state and local levels, there has been a rapid increase of literacy coaches hired to improve the reading expertise available to teachers and students at the school site level. The majority of these coaches have been hired to serve the primary grades because students are first learning to read at this level. Unfortunately, a large percent of students entering the middle grades do not have the skills necessary to comprehend core curriculum texts. Middle grades teachers often believe that students have come to them prepared to read and do not consider themselves as reading teachers equipped to teach literacy skills. A literacy coach can provide on-site staff development and coaching support to middle ix school teachers which will positively impact the literacy skills of young adolescent students. This project has developed a handbook for middle school literacy coaches, based on current research, which was field tested at a small, rural Northern California middle school. The handbook lists <b>desirable</b> <b>qualifications</b> for and responsibilities of middle grades literacy coaches. The handbook also describes the characteristics of young adolescents, their literacy development, and teaching strategies that {{have been shown to be}} effective in engaging these students while positively impacting their literacy development. Survey results in the final evaluation of this project showed positive results from the middle school teachers included in the field testing. All teachers indicated that the services offered by the literacy coach were beneficial to their teaching and had a positive impact on student learning and literacy skills development.

40|$|A {{new form}} of foreign travel called “voluntourism” has emerged in Sweden. In {{advertisements}} that invite to “make a difference”, travel agencies promote short- term aid opportunities at for example orphanages or schools in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. International volunteer work is nothing new. Rather, the volunteer agencies have entered an old and established organizational field. Using theories of new institutionalism and the analytical phrase “the story about”, this thesis investigates the way international aid work originated and evolved, and how commercial volunteer agencies entered the field. The thesis is partly based on historical data from organizational reports, biographies of aid work icons, and interviews with volunteers active during the 1960 s and 1970 s. Additionally, it makes use of contemporary data from interviews with representatives from volunteer travel agencies and volunteers. It also includes an analysis of how the travel agencies present their business operations on their websites. The thesis concludes that travel agencies apply the common perception of international aid work’s characteristics when marketing volunteer travels. This common perception can be traced through the evolution of international aid work. Travel agencies attract volunteers by offering access to this exclusive field. The volunteers are well-educated young women from middle class families. They are looking for experiences from international aid work, perspective on their own lives, and first-hand knowledge of local and traditional societies in poor countries. Nevertheless, due to the esteem in which the organizational field is viewed, a brief period spent as an aid worker is considered a <b>desirable</b> <b>qualification</b> for a job applicant. I interpret volunteer travel as a “grand tour”...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse {{potential}} changes in the genre of recruitment advertisement during the period 1955 to 2005, and investigate if changes in society can explain these changes in the genre. The study shows that some conventions regarding content, laoyut and style develops during the period. An important change is that information about the employer becomes an almost compulsory part of the advertisement {{by the end of}} the period. It also gets a salient place in the advertisement. The language/style is more conservative in some regards in the recruitment advertisements than in other genres. In the advertisement, an ideal applicant is constructed through the personal qualitaties asked for, the kind of benefits promised and information about preferred age and sex. During the whole period, one of the personal qualities most sought after is the ability to co-operate. This could be seen as a sign of the stability in Swedish working life. In the year of 2000, however, personal drive becomes the most <b>desirable</b> <b>qualification</b> instead of ability to co-operate. As the ideal candidate is constructed in the advertisement, so is the employer constructed as an attractive employer. The most common way of describing the employer during the whole period is as large, leading and expansive. At the end of the period there is a small but increasing amount of advertisements, which construct a new kind of employer identity more focused on advantages for the employee. During a period of fifty years, conventions for content, visual design and style develop in the recruitment advertisement. Some of these conventions are no longer in use when Internet becomes a competitor to the printed daily newspaper, but some are still used in recruitment advertisements on Internet. What is changing most is the view of the ideal candidate and the good employer. The way these are presented also affects the genre...|$|R

The job requirements specified a Masters Degree and experience. In fact, the majority of Health Physicists in the group were certified by the American Board of Health Physics. Under those circumstances, {{it was assumed that}} individuals in the group were technically qualified and the HPT instructor qualification stated that. In late 1993, the Health Physics Group at the LLNL was restructured and the training function was assigned to the training group. Additional requirements for training were mandated by the Department of Energy (DOE), which would necessitate increasing the existing training staff. With the need to hire, and the policy of reassignment of employees during downsizing, it was imperative that formal qualification standards be developed for technical knowledge. Qualification standards were in place for instructional capability. In drafting the new training qualifications for instructors, the requirements of a Certified Health Physicists had to be modified due to supply and demand. Additionally, for many of the performance-based training courses, registration by the National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologists is more <b>desirable.</b> Flexibility in <b>qualification</b> requirements has been incorporated to meet the reality of ongoing training and the compensation for desirable skills of individuals who may not meet all the criteria.

60|$|Of all modes {{in which}} a {{national}} representation can possibly be constituted, this one affords the best security for the intellectual <b>qualifications</b> <b>desirable</b> in the representatives. At present, by universal admission, it {{is becoming more and}} more difficult for any one who has only talents and character to gain admission into the House of Commons. The only persons who can get elected are those who possess local influence, or make their way by lavish expenditure, or who, on the invitation of three or four tradesmen or attorneys, are sent down by one of the two great parties from their London clubs, as men whose votes the party can depend on under all circumstances. On Mr. Hare's system, those who did not like the local candidates would fill up their voting papers by a selection from all the persons of national reputation on the list of candidates with whose general political principles they were in sympathy. Almost every person, therefore, who had made himself in any way honorably distinguished, though devoid of local influence, and having sworn allegiance to no political party, would have a fair chance of making up the quota, and with this encouragement such persons might be expected to offer themselves in numbers hitherto undreamed of. Hundreds of able men of independent thought, who would have no chance whatever of being chosen by the majority of any existing constituency, have by their writings, or their exertions in some field of public usefulness, made themselves known and approved by a few persons in almost every district of the kingdom; and if every vote that would be given for them in every place could be counted for their election, they might be able to complete the number of the quota. In no other way which it seems possible to suggest would Parliament be so certain of containing the very élite of the country.|$|R
5000|$|The Donoughmore Commission of 1928 {{recommended}} universal franchise, {{and this}} was also meant to include the plantation workers as well. Page 57 of the report proposed: [...] In the first place we consider it very <b>desirable</b> that a <b>qualification</b> of five years residence in the Island (allowing the temporary absence not exceeding eight months in all during the five years period) should be introduced in order that the privilege of voting should be confined {{to those who have}} an abiding interest in the country or who may be regarded as permanently settled in the Island... this condition will be of particular importance in its application to the Indian immigrant population. Secondly, we consider that the registration of voters should not be compulsory or automatic but should be restricted to those who apply for it. [...] However, the very concept of universal franchise was anathema to most of the political leaders of that era. Ponnambalam Ramanathan, a highly respected leader, opposed universal franchise as he felt that the caste system {{was an integral part of}} the Hindu way of life, and led a delegation to London seeking to legally enshrine the caste hierarchy, and dethrone universal franchise. The Kandyan Sinhalese also objected to the enfranchisement of the Indian estate workers as they feared that their electoral base would be diluted by a large influx of Indian Tamil votes. They also argued that the tea estates were land plundered by the British, and that the Kandyan peasants had been driven from their traditional lands and those injustices would be compounded if the Indian workers were legitimized. Governor Stanley, by an order in council introduced restrictions on the citizenship of Indian workers to make the Donoughmore proposals acceptable to the Ceylonese leaders. Thus the first state council of 1931, which consisted of many Tamil and Sinhalese members, agreed to not to enfranchise the majority of the Indian estate workers. (p 36), ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{experienced}} qualification needs and relevant qualifications procedures for school principals in upper secondary education, specified in the following question: What qualifications do school principals in upper secondary education believe they need in both administrative and pedagogical fields, and how are these needs expected to be fulfilled? This study's methodological foundation in phenomenography is based upon principals understanding of the surrounding world through their consciousness and experiences. According to Kroksmark (2007), phenomenography is a research methodology associated with the way in which something is perceived in a particular context. The central aspect of this approach is delineating the content of that which is perceived, i. e. which <b>qualification</b> needs are <b>desirable</b> and which <b>qualifications</b> are relevant. In this study, needs and methods are analyzed as they appear to the respondents and to me. A qualitative study is carried out using interviews conducted among a selected group of 20 school principals. In the study, the results, as they apply to administrative tasks, are primarily related to systems and rules of an overarching nature. This applies first and foremost to the implementation of leadership in the managerial part of the organization. Pedagogical leadership, meanwhile, pertains to the implementation of learning processes and development among students and staff in upper secondary schools. The first area of discussion will focus on qualification needs. This encompasses knowledge and skills school principals believe they require, i. e. adaptation and cooperation abilities, in addition to the creativity needed by the individual to accomplish mandatory leadership tasks, based on individual and societal needs, aims, and demands. While examining qualification needs, the study addresses core topics such as organization, interplay, school development, and the financial-administrative field. Organisation relates to social units, constructs, or phenomena included in further social environments. Interplay applies to interpersonal relations which include information, in terms of work and social implementations which in turn require adaptations to norms, rules of play, and strategies. Scholastic development has a creative foundation, which encompasses renewal and growth in upper secondary education. In the financial-administrative field, which forms a relatively strong, overarching framework for the operation of upper secondary schools, the key elements are financial issues and personnel management. The second area of the study, qualification, pertains to the necessary ability, knowledge, and skills for the implementation of initiatives and processes needed to cover emerging qualification needs for increased insight. The respondents tend to particularly focus on qualifications obtained through continuing education courses, experience in other organizations, and through peer advising. Thematically, theoretical increases in qualifications occur, which can be used to explain phenomena or actions when specific conditions are present. However, experiential learning, i. e. the execution of practical tasks and completion of experiential exchanges through information and communication exchanges in social interplay, is emphasised as the most qualifying initiative...|$|R
