He knew Scotland, and loved it; and there is hardly an event in any of his Scottish novels in which we do not breathe the very atmosphere of the place, and feel the presence of its moors and mountains. The place, morever, is usually so well chosen and described that the action seems almost {{to be the result}} of natural environment. Perhaps the most striking illustration of this harmony between scene and incident is found in Old Mortality, where Morton approaches the cave of the old Covenanter, and where the spiritual terror inspired by the fanatic's struggle with imaginary fiends is paralleled by the physical terror of a gulf and a roaring <b>flood</b> <b>spanned</b> by a slippery tree trunk. A second illustration of the same harmony of scene and incident is found in the meeting of the arms and ideals of the East and West, when the two champions fight in the burning desert, and then eat bread together in the cool shade of the oasis, as described in the opening chapter of The Talisman. A third illustration is found in that fascinating love scene, where Ivanhoe lies wounded, raging at his helplessness, while the gentle Rebecca alternately hides and reveals her love as she describes the terrific assault on the castle, which goes on beneath her window. His thoughts are all on the fight; hers on the man she loves; and both are natural, and both are exactly what we expect under the circumstances. These are but striking examples of the fact that, in all his work, Scott tries to preserve perfect harmony between the scene and the action.|$|R

40|$|In New Caledonia, a world-renowned mangrove, the "Coeur de Voh", {{grows in}} a {{semi-arid}} climate and at a high elevation in the intertidal zone. Net CO 2 exchange (NEE) between the Avicennia marina shrub mangrove and the atmosphere was studied using an eddy-covariance system. The NEE and its biophysical controls were investigated, and net ecosystem production (NEP) was determined for one year. The daytime NEE ranged from - 10. 7 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) to + 6. 9 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) and the nighttime NEE ranged from + 0. 38 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) to + 8. 80 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1). Both minimum values of daytime NEE and maximum values of nighttime NEE were measured during the wet, and warm season. Solar radiation, temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the controlling factors of NEE variations on both diel and seasonal scales. Water availability from tides and rainfall appeared to be key factors driving mangrove productivity. The tidal cycle also had pronounced effects on the mangrove NEE. Our results suggest that submerged conditions during high tide decreased the ecosystem respiration contribution and may increase the rate of tree photosynthesis. The absence of <b>flooding</b> <b>spanning</b> a few days rapidly decreased the NEE, suggesting that the trees experience water stress. The NEP was significantly and negatively correlated with rainfall and showed high seasonal variation. During the wet season, the NEP was very low and even negative, whereas the ecosystem photosynthesis was the greatest of the year. Indeed, the low NEP during the wet season was related to {{a significant increase in}} ecosystem respiration, whereas the low NEP during the dry season was linked to a decrease in ecosystem photosynthesis due primarily to an absence of freshwater from rainfall and seawater from tides. We estimate that the annual NEP was 73. 8 gC m(- 2) and may be lower if carbon tidal exports are significant. Consequently, the NEP of this dwarf mangrove in a semi-arid climate was much lower than that of mangroves in humid climates...|$|R

40|$|Glacier {{outburst}} floods are sudden {{releases of}} {{large amounts of}} water from a glacier. They are a pervasive natural hazard worldwide. They have an association with climate primarily via glacier mass balance and their impacts on society partly depend on population pressure and land use. Given the ongoing changes in climate and land use and population distributions there is therefore an urgent need to discriminate the spatio-temporal patterning of glacier outburst floods and their impacts. This study presents data compiled from 20 countries and comprising 1348 glacier <b>floods</b> <b>spanning</b> 10 centuries. Societal impacts were assessed using a relative damage index based on recorded deaths, evacuations, and property and infrastructure destruction and disruption. These floods originated from 332 sites; 70 % were from ice-dammed lakes and 36 % had recorded societal impact. The number of floods recorded has apparently reduced since the mid- 1990 s in all major world regions. Two thirds of sites that have produced >  5 floods (n =  32) have floods occurring progressively earlier in the year. Glacier floods have directly caused at least: 7 deaths in Iceland, 393 deaths in the European Alps, 5745 deaths in South America and 6300 deaths in central Asia. Peru, Nepal and India have experienced fewer floods yet higher levels of damage. One in five sites in the European Alps has produced floods that have damaged farmland, destroyed homes and damaged bridges; 10 % of sites in South America have produced glacier floods that have killed people and damaged infrastructure; 15 % of sites in central Asia have produced floods that have inundated farmland, destroyed homes, damaged roads and damaged infrastructure. Overall, Bhutan and Nepal have the greatest national-level economic consequences of glacier flood impacts. We recommend that accurate, full and standardised monitoring, recording and reporting of glacier floods is essential if spatio-temporal patterns in glacier flood occurrence, magnitude and societal impact are to be better understood. We note that future modelling of the global impact of glacier floods cannot assume that the same trends will continue and will need to consider combining land-use change with probability distributions of geomorphological responses to climate change and to human activity...|$|R

40|$|Catastrophic floods are {{important}} events, {{particularly in the}} Mediterranean region, where they cause damage to life and property and have major effects on the landscape. Unfortunately, their violence and rarity means that investigating them using conventional hydrological monitoring is often not possible. This study uses palaeoflood hydrological techniques to extend flood records and further {{our understanding of the}} occurrence and effects of catastrophic floods in the Mediterranean region. Research has focused on the Voidomatis and Aoos basins; two steepland catchments in northwest Greece. Periods of catastrophic flooding are placed within the context of long-term environmental variability and landscape change, so that the environmental controls on catastrophic flooding, and the effects they have had in the development of these river systems can be fully understood. The late Quaternary behaviour of the Voidomatis River has primarily been controlled by climatic conditions. Uranium-series dating results show that major phases of aggradation took place during the cold stages of the Late Pleistocene. Climatic amelioration in the Lateglacial and the Holocene periods reduced sediment supply and induced progressive incision until the last c. 1000 years or so, when prominent vertical accretion in the contemporary floodplain has occurred. Late Quaternary variations in fine-grained fluvial sediment sources are explored using a quantitative fingerprinting technique. These provenance data are shown to be valuable for reconstructing long-term changes in river activity. Analyses of palaeoflood slackwater deposits provides evidence for the occurrence of two distinct periods of Late Pleistocene catastrophic flooding, at around 21 ka and 17 cal ka. Fine sediment provenance data enable a detailed analysis of catchment conditions at the time of these flood events. Glacial meltwater discharges and general climatic and hydrological instability during the last glacial-interglacial transition were important factors in generating these floods. Palaeoflood information obtained from boulder berms and overbank floodplain sedimentation are combined with the short duration gauged data to develop a record of high magnitude <b>flooding</b> <b>spanning</b> the last 200 years. Catastrophic flooding is shown to reoccur at least every 40 to 50 years. Boulder berms record a decrease in the magnitude of extreme floods over this period, in response to hydrological changes induced by climatic warming following the end of the Little Ice Age (c. 1850 AD). This {{is one of the first}} extensive applications of palaeoflood hydrology in the Mediterranean region. High magnitude floods over long timescales are shown to play an important role in the late Quaternary development and contemporary operation of these mountain catchments. This study illustrates the potential value of palaeoflood hydrological techniques to flood prone regions of the Mediterranean, where systematic hydrological data are inadequate for understanding and predicting extreme flood events...|$|R

Concerns over the potential linkages between regulation of the Peace River in 1968 for hydroelectric production and low Peace River discharge between 1968 and 1971 during the filling of the hydroelectric reservoir, absence of a major ice-jam flood event between 1975 and 1995, and low water levels in perched basins during the 1980 s and early 1990 s have sparked numerous environmental studies largely aimed at restoring water levels in the PAD. Lack of sufficient long-term hydrological records, however, has limited the ability to objectively assess the importance of anthropogenic factors versus natural climatic forcing in regulating hydroecological conditions of the PAD. Here, we report results of a paleolimnological study on laminated sediments from two oxbow lakes in the PAD, which are located adjacent to major flood distributaries of the Peace River.

However, long time-series of climate and gauge data at high-elevation are too sparse to assess reliably the rate of recurrence of such events in mountain areas. Here paleolimnological techniques were used to assess the evolution of frequency and magnitude of flash flood events in the North-western European Alps since the Little Ice Age (LIA). The aim was to document a possible effect of the post- 19 th century global warming on torrential floods frequency and magnitude. Altogether 56 flood deposits were detected from grain size and geochemical measurements performed on gravity cores taken in the proglacial Lake Blanc (2170 ma. s. l., Belledonne Massif, NW French Alps). The age model relies on radiometric dating (137 Cs and 241 Am), historic lead contamination and the correlation of major flood- and earthquaketriggered deposits, with recognized occurrences in historical written archives. The resulting <b>flood</b> calendar <b>spans</b> the last ca 270 years (AD 1740 -AD 2007). The magnitude of flood events was inferred from the accumulated sediment mass per flood event and compared with reconstructed or homogenized datasets of precipitation, temperature and glacier variations.

This thesis addresses the computational complexity {{of a range of}} problems falling within one or both of these subjects. Much of the thesis is concerned with the computational complexity of problems related to the combinatorial game (Free-) Flood-It, in which players aim to make a coloured graph monochromatic ("flood" the graph) with the minimum possible number of flooding operations; such problems are known to be computationally hard in many cases. We begin by proving some general structural results about the behaviour of the game, including a powerful characterisation of the number of moves required to flood a graph {{in terms of the number}} of moves required to <b>flood</b> its <b>spanning</b> trees; these structural results are then applied to prove tractability results about a number of flood-filling problems. We also consider the computational complexity of flood-filling problems when the game is played on a rectangular grid of fixed height (focussing in particular on 3 xn and 2 xn grids), answering an open question of Clifford, Jalsenius, Montanaro and Sach. The final chapter concerns the parameterised complexity of list problems on graphs of bounded treewidth. We prove structural results determining the list edge chromatic number and list total chromatic number of graphs with bounded treewidth and large maximum degree, which are special cases of the List (Edge) Colouring Conjecture and Total Colouring Conjecture respectively. Using these results, we show that the problem of determining either of these quantities is fixed parameter tractable, parameterised by the treewidth of the input graph. Finally, we analyse a list version of the Hamilton Path problem, and prove it to be W[1]-hard when parameterised by the pathwidth of the input graph.

40|$|As the {{historian}} for the Mississippi River Commission and the Mississippi River and Tributaries project, I face {{the dilemma of}} leaving behind a record of current events for future generations. Oddly, {{it is easier for}} me to document the activities and accomplishments of the commission and the project from one hundred years ago than five or ten years ago. This is because very few paper records exist nowadays. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi River Commission generate voluminous amounts of memoranda, studies, correspondence, and briefings, but most can only be found in an electronic format. It was against this backdrop that I endeavored to produce this study. I do not view the pages that follow as a historical study, although I do incorporate historical material to provide context for key elements of the story. Instead, the narrative is more representative of an eyewitness account of a historic event. During several presentations and speaking engagements that I delivered after the flood, my audiences seemed to want the answer to three basic questions. The first involved the decision-making processes at the three floodways placed into operation in 2011. The second involved the history of the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway. The third involved the absence of a floodway to relieve pressure between the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway and the Old River control complex. This study attempts to addresses those questions. The chapters that chronicle the 2011 flood rely heavily on my own notes – a diary of sorts – interviews conducted after the event with key players that I identified during my coverage of the flood, daily situation reports from the district offices, daily emergency management briefings that tracked changing conditions, and electronic correspondence. To that end, one of {{the purposes of this study}} is to leave behind a transparent record of the 2011 flood so that future historians will have a central repository to work from. Yet, there is one caveat. The <b>flood</b> roughly <b>spanned</b> a three-week period and impacted the entire Mississippi River and Tributaries project system. Naturally, I could not be in all places at once, so coverage is limited to the three floodways and the flood fight in the Vicksburg Engineer District. Heroic flood fights took place along both banks of the Mississippi River from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atchafalaya River from Simmesport to Morgan City. The absence of a detailed discussion at any specific location is in no way intended to trivialize those desperate efforts to convey the flood. The chapters that provide historical context rely heavily on my personal collection of primary source material accumulated over the past decade in the form of correspondence, technical papers, reports, and Engineering News-Record articles.

40|$|Floods are extreme {{events that}} can have large impacts on human {{societies}} and ecosystems. They arise from a multitude of causes and can have very different consequences depending on regional and local circumstances. Floods {{are part of the}} natural hydrological cycle, but adverse impacts arise when water masses inundate infrastructures and land that cannot cope with the excessive water. Major flood disasters in Europe have caused loss of lives and economic loss that amount to billions of euro, but aggregated over large areas small local floods also produce significant losses. Analyses of trends of past flood events suggest flood hazard may have increased in parts of Europe. Available evidence suggests high flows have been increasing in northern Europe, especially in western Britain and coastal Scandinavia. Regional patterns are, however, diverse, with many weak negative trends occurring in northern Europe as well, and a very mixed pattern in central Europe. Across most of the continent, however, urbanisation and the accumulation of assets in flood prone areas have led to increasing trends in the damages and economic consequences of floods. Global warming may reduce flood hazard in areas that are dominated by annual snowmelt floods, except in those regions where a sharp increase in winter snowfalls outweighs the effects of a warmer and shorter snow season. In other parts of Europe there is greater uncertainty in how flood hazard will change due to climate change. Increases in extreme river flows have, however, been predicted in several studies and may occur over relatively short time <b>spans.</b> <b>Flood</b> risk management is a demanding task that requires careful analysis of flood hazards and their causes, assessments of the magnitude of the risks, systematic planning to reduce risks and adaptation in the face of possible change. Dam safety is a major issue in dealing with flood risks. Flood risk management requires appropriate institutions, technical solutions and functioning governance structures. Recently participatory approaches have opened up new avenues for the development of flood risk management. Promising examples of participatory flood risk management have been documented. Flood risk management has been seeking new directions and needs to adapt to an uncertain future. Flood risk management needs to consider developments in exposure and vulnerability due to land-use change and infrastructure development. Due to the combined effects of climate change and socio-economic development flood risk is unlikely to remain stationary. Scenarios for flood risk management thus have to combine socio-economic scenarios, such as projections for population growth, urbanisation and industrial developments with projections of future flood hazards. Detailed scenario studies are still missing in many river catchments. Recent studies have suggested that climate change can add significantly to the expected damages in some parts of Europe over the coming decades. Adaptation to changes in flood hazards and risk is therefore an essential element in efforts to adapt to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The 1815 - 1705 Ma Redbank {{package is}} a 3 - 6 km thick {{succession}} of shallow marine to braided fluvial sandstone and lesser conglomerate, mudstone, carbonates and rhyolitic-basaltic volcanics and high-level intrusions. It forms {{the base of}} the Palaeo proterozoic McArthur Basin in northern Australia. In the southern McArthur Basin, the Tawallah Group is the best exposed stratigraphic component of this package. Coarse-grained facies at {{the base of the}} Group formed in a proximal-medial braided fluvial environment and are overlain by widespread sheets of supermature quartzarenite and intervening flood basalt. These enigmatic sandstone sheets contain features consistent with deposition in a complex high-energy shallow marine, fluvial and aeolian setting on an extensive low-gradient shelf Overlying mudstones and carbonates were deposited on a shallow epeiric shelf and coastal sabkha fringe that onlapped basement tectonic ridges. A regional sequence boundary formed during subsequent regional uplift and local synsedimentary deformation, and was followed by deposition of another widespread quartzarenite sheet. The overlying succession of fine-grained sandstone, mudstone, carbonate and evaporitic redbeds suggest more diverse depositional settings. Marginal marine salina, near-shore peritidal, storm-dominated shelf and moderately deep water settings, with periodic restriction to the marine realm, fluctuating accommodation rates and minor synsedimentary faulting are all recorded. Regional-scale dolerite sills and an extensive stacked succession of basalt sheets were emplaced sequentially as widely-dispersed invasive flows under a thin blanket of wet unconsolidated sediment and peperite. Volcanism was locally associated with uplift and emplacement of polymict debris flows and breccia bodies. This was followed by deposition of a complex association of clastic sediments and felsic volcanics and intrusion of high-level plutons (upper Tawallah Group). Sheet-like rhyolitic lavas with abrupt talus-lined margins evolved via non-explosive eruption and long-term viscous flow. This was facilitated by low water content and high and continuous eruption temperature and effusion rate. Complex ephemeral alluvial and debris flow aprons formed adjacent to the lavas, recording the generation, erosional denudation and final burial of a dynamic high-relief volcano-tectonic landscape. Epiclastic materials were reworked in bordering lakes and low-relief braid plains that prograded radially away from the volcanic centres. Periods between magmatic events were characterised by deposition of widespread immature sandstone sheets in extensive high-energy ephemeral to perennial braided fluvial settings and the development of low-relief regional disconformities. Concurrent pluton emplacement in the northern McArthur Basin generated a series of structural domes with peripheral deformation. Accommodation space for intrusion was provided by decollement at ductility transitions, upward flexuring, outward gravity slide and vertical displacement of overlying sediments. Detailed stratigraphic and facies analysis of the Tawallah Group has enabled the development of a tectonostratigraphic framework for the entire Redbank package. Four second order subdivisions are recognised (Yirrumanja, Liverpool, Costello and Mitchell mesopackages) that facilitate a clearer, integrated regional understanding of the lithology, timing and geographic distribution of basin phases. The package concept is also applied to the composite McArthur Basin system as a whole. Five distinct and regionally coherent basin phases are recognised (Redbank, Goyder, Glyde, Favenc and Wilton packages). These were deposited in a dynamic tectonic environment over a period of - 350 m. y. Geochemical characterisation of Proterozoic igneous phases in northern Australia has confirmed many lithostratigraphic correlations in the McArthur Basin. Felsic units show temporal and spatial variation in geochemistry that reflects partial melting of heterogeneous Archaean mafic lower crust due to the emplacement oflarge basaltic magma chambers and radiogenic heating. The McArthur Basin contains five main mafic igneous phases with typical <b>flood</b> basalt attributes, <b>spanning</b> a period of - 480 m. y. Magmas were derived by partial melting of chemically-stratified lower lithosphere and do not exhibit a plume or rift signature. A convergent intracratonic setting is proposed for the Redbank package. Basin architecture reflects diverse subsidence mechanisms operating inboard of the active southern margin of the North Australian Craton (Strangways arc). Wedge-shaped and magmatic-related basin architectures formed during subduction. Subsidence was influenced by dynamic topography, thermally- and mechanically-driven viscoelastic behaviour of heterogeneous crust, magmatic underplating, lithospheric phase transformations, and local transtension and isostatic loading. Local growthfault architecture formed by incipient back-arc extension. Magmatism was driven by a persistent thermal anomaly related to insulative heating and a transient convective roll emanating from the Strangways arc, that eroded the lower lithosphere and generated a magma pool. Migration of magma into lower-crustal magma chambers and to the surface took place at transtensional sites along lithosphere-scale strike-slip faults. Regional unconformities and elongate and wedge basin architectures formed in the Redbank package during periodic terrane accretion events at the Strangways arc. Subsidence was influenced largely by transmission of in-plane stress through the lithosphere to produce lithosphere-scale folding, viscoelastic deflections of the lithosphere, and transtensional strike-slip and flexural back-bulge basins. Local elongate magmatic grabens are interpreted as impactogens resulting from indentor tectonics. ...|$|R
40|$|Floodplain lakes are {{strongly}} regulated by river connectivity because floodwaters exert strong {{influence on the}} water balance, the physical, chemical and biological limnological conditions, and the influx of contaminants. The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta (Canada) is a hydrologically complex landscape and is an important node in the upper Mackenzie River Drainage Basin. The ecological integrity of the PAD is potentially threatened by multiple environmental stressors, yet {{our understanding of the}} hydroecology of this large floodplain remains underdeveloped. Indeed, ever since the planning and construction of the WAC Bennett Dam (1960 s), concerns have grown over the effects of upstream human activities on the lakes of the PAD. More recently, concerns over the health of the PAD have intensified and come to the fore of national and international dialogue due to water abstraction and mining and processing activities by the rapidly expanding oil sands industry centred in Fort McMurray Alberta. Currently, widespread perception is that upstream human activities have reduced water levels and frequency of flooding at the PAD, which have lowered nutrient availability and productivity of perched basin lakes, and have increased supply of pollutants from oil sands. However, these perceptions remain based on insufficient knowledge of pre-impact conditions and natural variability. Current and past relations between hydrology and limnology of PAD lakes are mostly undocumented, particularly during the important spring freshet period when the effects of river flood waters are strongest. Similarly, knowledge of the deposition of oil-sands- related contaminants in the PAD remains insufficient to determine whether anthropogenic activities have increased the deposition of important oil-sands-related contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) relative to natural processes. Such knowledge gaps must be filled to achieve effective monitoring, policy and governance concerning impacts of industrial development and the protection of human and environmental health within the PAD and Mackenzie drainage basin. This thesis examines the effects of river flooding (and the lack of) on water clarity, nutrients, chemistry, phytoplankton abundance, epiphyton community composition and the deposition of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in lakes of the Peace-Athabasca Delta. To determine the role of flooding on contemporary epiphytic diatom communities (an abundant and diverse guild of primary producers in PAD lakes), a field experiment was conducted examining the community composition and abundance of epiphytic diatoms in four PAD lakes. Two of these four lakes had received floodwaters that spring and two had not. Epiphytic diatom communities in each lake were sampled during the peak macrophyte biomass period (summer) from two macrophyte taxa (Potamogeton zosteriformis, P. perfoliatus var. richardsonii) and from polypropylene artificial substrates previously deployed that spring. A two-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test identified that epiphytic diatom community composition differed between lakes that flooded and those that did not flood. From the use of similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, diatom taxa were identified that discriminate between flooded and non-flooded lakes. The relative abundance of ‘strong flood indicator taxa’ was used to construct an event-scale <b>flood</b> record <b>spanning</b> the past ~ 180 years using analyses of sedimentary diatom assemblages from a closed-drainage lake (PAD 5). Results were verified by close agreement with an independent paleo-flood record from a nearby flood-prone oxbow lake (PAD 54) and historical records. Comparison of epiphytic diatoms in flooded and non-flooded lakes in this study provides a promising approach to detect changes in flood frequency, and may have applications for reconstructing other pulse-type disturbances such as hurricanes and pollutant spills. Additionally, this study demonstrates that artificial substrates can provide an effective bio-monitoring tool for lakes of the PAD and elsewhere. To improve our understanding of the hydrolimnological responses of lake in the PAD to flooding, repeated measurements over three years (2003 - 05) were made on a series of lakes along a hydrological gradient. This allowed the role of river flooding to be characterized on limnological conditions of lakes and to identify the patterns and timescales of limnological change after flooding. River floodwaters elevate lake water concentrations of suspended sediment, total phosphorus (TP), SO 4 and dissolved Si (DSi), and reduce concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), DOC and most ions. River flooding increases limnological homogeneity among lakes, because post-flood conditions {{are strongly}} affected by the river water properties. After floodwaters recede, limnological conditions become more heterogeneous among lakes in response to diversity of local basin influences (geology, slope, vegetation, depth, fetch, and biological communities and processes), and limnological changes occur at two distinct timescales. In the weeks to months after flooding, water clarity increases as suspended sediments and TP settle out of the water column. In the absence of flooding for many years to decades, evaporative concentration leads to an increase in most nutrients (TKN, inorganic N, and dissolved P), DOC and ions. Contrary to a prevailing paradigm, these results suggest that regular flooding is not required to maintain high nutrient concentrations. In light of anticipated declines in river discharge, limnological conditions in the southern Athabasca sector will become increasingly less dominated by the short-term effects of flooding, and resemble nutrient- and solute-rich lakes in the northern Peace sector that are infrequently flooded. To determine the roles of the Athabasca River and atmospheric transport as vectors for the deposition of PACs in the PAD, sediment cores spanning the last ~ 200 years were collected from three lakes within the delta. A closed-drainage basin elevated well above the floodplain (PAD 18) was selected to determine temporal patterns of change in PAC concentration due to atmospheric deposition and within-basin production of PACs. Known patterns of paleohydrological changes at the other two lakes (PAD 23 and 31) were used to assess the role of the Athabasca River in delivering PACs to the Athabasca Delta during the ~ 200 year. Well- dated sediment core samples were analysed for 52 alkylated and non-alkylated PACs (method EPA 3540 / 8270 -GC/MS). Sediments deposited in the non-flood prone lake (PAD 18) contained lower concentrations of total PACs compared to sediments deposited during flood-prone periods in the other study lakes, and were dominated by PACs of a pyrogenic rather than bitumen origin. Multivariate analysis of similarity tests identified that the composition of PACs differs between sediments deposited during not flood-prone and flood-prone periods. Subsequent Similarities Percentage (SIMPER) analysis was used and identified seven PACs that are preferentially deposited during flood-prone periods. These seven PACs are bitumen-associated, river-transported and account for 51 % of the total PACs found in oil-sands sediment. At PAD 31, which has been flood-prone both before and since onset of Athabasca oil sands development, identified no measureable differences in both the proportion and concentration of the river-transported indicator PACs in sediments deposited pre- 1940 s versus post- 1982. Our findings suggest that natural erosion of exposed bitumen {{along the banks of the}} Athabasca River and its tributaries is the main process delivering PACs to the Athabasca Delta, and that the spring freshet is a key period for contaminant mobilization and transport. Such key baseline environmental information is essential for informed management of natural resources and human-health concerns by provincial and federal regulatory agencies and industry, and for designing effective long-term monitoring and surveillance programs for the lower Athabasca River watershed in the face of future oil sands development. Further monitoring activities and additional paleolimnological studies of the depositional history of PACs and other oil-sands- and non-oil-sands-related contaminants is strongly recommended. Overall, results of this research identify that river flooding exerts strong control on physical, chemical and biological conditions of lakes within the PAD. However, contrary to prevailing paradigms, the PAD is not a landscape that has been adversely and permanently affected by regulation of the Peace River and industrial development of the oil sands along the Athabasca River. Instead, data from contemporary and paleolimnological studies identify that natural processes continue to dominate the delivery of water and contaminants to the delta. Regular and frequent flooding is not essential to maintain the supply of nutrients and productivity of delta lakes, which has been a widespread paradigm that developed in the absence of objective scientific data. Instead, nutrient concentrations rise over years to decades after flooding and lake productivity increases. During the thesis research, novel approaches were developed and demonstrated to be effective. Namely, new artificial substrate samplers were designed for aquatic biomonitoring that accrue periphyton and can identify the occurrence of flood events. Also, paleolimnological methods were employed to characterize the composition and concentration of PACs supplied by natural processes prior to oil sands industrial activity, which serves as an important benchmark for assessing industrial impacts. These are effective methods that can be employed to improve monitoring programs and scientific understanding of the factors affecting this world-renowned landscape, as well as floodplains elsewhere. 1 yea...|$|R
