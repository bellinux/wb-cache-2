5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
5|$|McCann was {{an active}} member of the Big Brother Movement in South Australia, which was {{involved}} in supporting boys that had migrated to Australia from the United Kingdom under the Child Migrant scheme. He commanded the 43rd Battalion until July 1930 when he transferred to the Unattached List, and continued as president of the RSSILA until 1931, leading the RSSILA delegation to the biennial conference of the British Empire Service League in London in 1929. Upon his return from the conference and a tour of the former battlefields and war cemeteries, he offered his personal opinion that World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been worthwhile, as the tremendous loss had resulted in little gain. This resulted in some public criticism by potential political opponents.|$|E
25|$|My misfortune I {{trust will}} be {{properly}} considered {{by all the}} World – It was a circumstance I could not foresee – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> sufficient Officers & had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> a Spirited & brave fellow about me & the Mutineers treated them as such. My conduct has been free of blame, & I showed everyone that, tied as I was, I defied every Villain to hurt me...|$|E

60|$|However, {{we got to}} Benton, Heaven {{knows how}} and why, but we were a sorry-looking lot, though our scalps were intact. If in all that region there is a {{mountain}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> climbed, a river that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> swum, an alkali pool that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> thrust my muzzle into, or an Indian that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> shuddered to think about, I am {{ready to go back}} in a Pullman sleeper and do my duty.|$|R

25|$|My fifth MiG kill was {{an exact}} {{duplicate}} of a syllabus mission (at Fighter Weapons School), so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> only flown {{that as a}} student, but had taught it probably a dozen times prior to actually doing it in combat.|$|E
25|$|We had {{to create}} our own {{journals}} because {{it was impossible to}} obtain entry into the official journals of psychiatry and medicine. Before 1967 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and by then I had about 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.|$|E
25|$|Then Boycott and Edrich {{began to}} run what in the Tests had been 'impossible' runs, to play what had been 'impossible' strokes...the Australian out-fieldsmen were hurling {{themselves}} about along the fence in a manner <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen for years in desperate endeavour to save fours and reduce runs.|$|E

60|$|Am I {{living for}} ambition? for fame? for show? for money? for pleasure? If so, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{the mind of}} Christ. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> found out the golden secret. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen what true glory is; what the glory of Christ is--to live {{for the sake of}} doing my duty--for the sake of doing good.|$|R
25|$|After {{about a year}} {{some trouble}} arose {{between them and the}} Indians, and I took the war path as a warrior, not as a chief. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been wronged, but some of my people had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the {{soldiers}} and not the Indians were at fault.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E
25|$|Abousfian felt it {{necessary}} to state why he didn't list the names of his supporters {{in a letter to the}} editor of Globe and Mail,"On the urging of my lawyers...I had earned the money by reciting alms. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> wanted to invite scrutiny of those who paid me, knowing where guilt by association can lead".|$|E

5000|$|He {{wrote about}} his work: [...] "I must add, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{relied on the}} {{knowledge}} of others; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> spoken nothing which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen or undergone..." [...]|$|R
25|$|The {{substance}} of what I took the liberty to mention {{to you this}} morning was: You are on {{the borders of the}} grave, as well as I; shortly we must both appear before God. When it seemed to me, some months since, that my life was near an end, I was troubled that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> dealt plainly with you. This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E
25|$|If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> heard {{long ago}} {{from other people}} {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since you thought I was sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your hand, as if you had me caught. I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> studied law. And I {{am afraid}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> the {{necessary}} push--I {{believe that is}} the name barristers give to their vulgarity--for success in pleading.|$|R

But <b>I</b> {{will tell you what}} is not the matter with me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> got housemaid’s knee. Why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> got housemaid’s knee, I cannot tell you; {{but the fact remains that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> got it. Everything else, however, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got.” ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen an Englishman bowl either faster {{or better}} than Snow at Sydney since Tyson...In a fast bowler rhythm and {{accuracy}} generally go hand in hand. When everything is absolutely ticking, so to speak, a strong fellow like Snow finds not only an extra yard of pace but seems able to keep an unerring eye on the target. The merit of Snow is that in this form is not only that that high arm and loose wrist get the utmost life and lift from the pitch but that he is so extraordinarily straight.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, {{and at once}} it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, Diggory! don't {{you know}} me?" [...] said she. [...] "But {{of course you}} don't, wrapped up like this. What do you mean? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been crying here, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been here before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A searching question! I answer--Yes and No. If on the {{one hand}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{accomplished}} what <b>I</b> set out to accomplish--which of us does!--on the other I can fairly say this: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> lowered my ideal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{would have}} made me say these things but your own good. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> wished to interfere; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> wished to give you pain. I am a useless old woman. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no {{children}} of my own. I only {{want to see you}} happy, Katharine." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E
500|$|Many notable {{painters}} {{have been}} influenced by this particular series including Les Fauves, Derain, and Vlaminck. Kandinsky's memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cotten was {{the only}} {{principal}} for whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses," [...] Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.|$|E
6000|$|... "No,--she could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done that. She <b>had</b> no authority. <b>I</b> only {{mention her}} name {{because it will}} have weight with you, and because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> done that which, under other circumstances, perhaps, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> been bound to do. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen your father." ...|$|R
