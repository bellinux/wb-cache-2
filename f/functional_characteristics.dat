25|$|All {{white blood}} cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets. Types of leukocytes can be {{classified}} in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These types are distinguished by their physical and <b>functional</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic. Further subtypes can be classified.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} gene is that it begins with two promoter regions. The first exon from the 5' end contains two tissue-specific promoter regions. Transcription can begin at either promoter (depending on the tissue) so that the same gene can produce a slightly different molecule in liver and in other tissues. The two isoforms of glucokinase differ only by 13–15 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the molecule, which produces only a minimal difference in structure. The two isoforms have the same kinetic and <b>functional</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In both Visigothic/Mozarabic and Gregorian chant, {{there is}} a {{distinction}} between antiphonal and responsorial chants. [...] Originally, responsorial chant alternated between a soloist singing a verse and a chorus singing a refrain called the respond, while antiphonal chant alternated between two semi-choruses singing a verse and an interpolated text called an antiphon. [...] In the developed chant traditions, they took on more <b>functional</b> <b>characteristics.</b> [...] In an antiphonal chant, the antiphon is generally longer and more melodic than the verse, which is usually sung to a simpler formula called a psalm tone. [...] In a responsorial chant, the verse and refrain are often comparable in style and melodic content.|$|E
2500|$|During {{embryonic}} development these {{inner cell mass}} cells continuously {{divide and}} become more specialized. [...] For example, {{a portion of the}} ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as 'neurectoderm', which will become the future central nervous system. [...] Later in development, neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural tube. [...] At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain. [...] At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a neural stem cell. [...] These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and <b>functional</b> <b>characteristics.</b> [...] The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called neurogenesis. [...] One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the radial glial cell, so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some glial characteristics, most notably the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). [...] The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular zone, adjacent to the developing ventricular system. [...] Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and thus their potency is restricted.|$|E
