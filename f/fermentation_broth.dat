25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to {{coagulate}} milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the <b>fermentation</b> <b>broth,</b> so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{alternative}} methodology (direct crystallisation) to {{the traditional}} calcium precipitation to obtain succinic acid (SA) from defined and wheat-based <b>fermentation</b> <b>broths</b> is reported. SA crystals were successfully recovered from <b>fermentation</b> <b>broths</b> (FB) using this method. A higher SA crystal purity (95 %) and yield (70 %) were obtained in the direct crystallisation method compared to a slightly modified traditional calcium precipitation method (90 % and 24 %, respectively). Chemical transformations (e. g. esterifications) to high-added value derivatives of both recovered SA crystals were then investigated using a range of solid acids including our acidic tunable mesoporous carbonaceous materials denoted as Starbon® acids. Results showed that SA crystals could be successfully converted into mono- and diesters in high yields and selectivities employing solid acids regardless of the reaction conditions. The order of reactivity was found to be: pure SA crystals > SA crystals from defined FB > FB SA crystals. Results demonstrate that SA can be effectively purified from actual <b>fermentation</b> <b>broths,</b> showing the importance of integrating the fermentation and downstream processing to optimise the fermentative production of SA and its chemical transformations to produce high-added value derivatives. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

50|$|Perstraction {{has been}} {{combined}} with the ABE (acetone butanol ethanol) fermentation for butanol production.

The application of LLE would also require the extractant to be sterilised prior to contact with the <b>fermentation</b> <b>broth.</b> Perstraction can overcome these problems due to a membrane separating the <b>fermentation</b> <b>broth</b> from the extractant.

40|$|Background: Finding new {{antitumor}} compounds {{is essential}} for treating cancer. Streptomyces species are the major producers of antitumor agents. The objective {{of the present study}} was to screen the products of soil isolated Streptomyces species using cell culture technique to detect antitumor agents.
