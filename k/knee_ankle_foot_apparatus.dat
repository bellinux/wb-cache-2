50|$|Splints, also {{referred}} to as orthoses, are designed to maintain or improve ROM, prevent deformity, and improve function. Splints help to support and keep limbs stretched, which delays or prevents the onset of contractures that commonly affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. <b>Ankle</b> <b>foot</b> orthoses (AFOs) can be used during sleep or during the day. The purpose of this is to keep the foot from pointing downward and sustain the stretch of the Achilles tendon. Maintaining the length of the tendo-Achilles, {{also referred}} to as the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, is extremely important for walking. <b>Knee</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>foot</b> orthoses (KAFOs) are also used for walking or for standing and can be used to prolong ambulation or help delay the onset of lower limb contractures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a new approach for orthopaedic footwear to apply in KAFO orthosis (acronym for <b>Knee</b> <b>Ankle</b> <b>Foot</b> Orthosis). This procedure starts with full characterization of the problem with the purpose to characterize a plantar of a patient’s foot with polio. A 3 D Scanner was used to collect their feet's data to produce an anatomic insole. After this step, the patient performs a study of his gait using a static and dynamic study with the aim of characterizing the parameters to improve quality in the footwear. The insole was produced using a 3 D printing technology. It was essential to optimize manufacturing processes and it was developed a footwear prototype with innovative characteristics, which is 25 % lighter, allowing the user to consume less energy in daily routines.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} work is to design and a new dynamic Stance Control <b>Knee</b> <b>Ankle</b> <b>Foot</b> Orthosis (SCKAFO) to support people with gait disorders, namely from patients with quadriceps femoris muscular weakness.

A bibliographic and field research is presented and computational models have been developed in order to analyze the human gait in different scenarios, with and without orthosis. The computational models allow the evaluation and quantification of biomechanical parameters, such as knee angle during human gait, foot-ground reaction forces and metabolic cost. A new SCKAFO orthosis will be designed and built taking into account several performance aspects such as geometrical, kinematical, dynamical, material, ergonomical and biomechanical.

Methods: Seven subjects with poliomyelitis who routinely wore conventional KAFOs participated in this study, and received training to enable them to ambulate with the powered KAFO on level ground, prior to gait analysis. Results: There were no significant differences in the gait symmetry index (SI) of step length (P= 0. 085), stance time (P= 0. 082), double limb support time (P= 0. 929) or speed of walking (p= 0. 325) between the two test conditions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{the range of}} forces and moments applied to lower limb orthoses during ambulation by routine users. DESIGN: Well-established gait analysis techniques {{were used to determine}} the loading at the major joints. It was assumed that the joint moments were transmitted by the orthosis encompassing any particular joint. Two hundred and five assessments of 164 patients were successfully completed by a consortium of four gait laboratories in Europe. The orthosis specification and patient clinical data were also recorded. BACKGROUND: The design and development of orthoses has occurred largely by evolution rather than by formal engineering methods. In particular, formal design has been hampered by a lack of information on the forces and moments applied during ambulation. METHODS: A standard gait analysis procedure was employed to capture the data. In-house biomechanical models were used to calculate the joint loading. Data were normalised with respect to patient weight and leg length. RESULTS: It was found that the median maximum normalised ankle moment transmitted by an <b>ankle</b> <b>foot</b> orthosis was 0. 15 and the maximum knee moment was 0. 09. The greatest moment transmitted by the hip joint of a hip <b>knee</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>foot</b> orthosis was also 0. 09. There was a wide variation in the data due to differences in the impairments of the test subjects. CONCLUSION: It is possible to estimate the loads transmitted by an orthosis using established gait analysis procedures without the need for load measurement transducers. There is now a need both to collect a larger representative dataset and to perform validation studies with transducers. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency, users’ satisfaction and tolerance of the <b>Knee</b> <b>Ankle</b> <b>Foot</b> Orthosis (KAFO) in treatment of painful genu recurvatum (PGR). Material and methodEpidemiologic retrospective monocentric study. Patients having a clinical PGR on stance phase confirmed by a practitioner. The main outcome was the pain before and after having the KAFO evaluated with the numerical verbal scale (NVS) of pain rated on 100 and the simple verbal scale (SVS) of pain. The secondary outcomes were the French version of the Quebec user evaluation of satisfaction with assistive technology (QUEBEC 2. 0) and a numerical scale of satisfaction (NSS) rated on 100. ResultsTwenty-seven patients but 31  KAFO have been analyzed (4  patients had both KAFO) : 25  free knee joints/ 6  locked knee joints. Before and after having the KAFO, the NVS of pain decreased from a mean of 80 / 100 to 26. 9 (P ≤  0. 001) and the SVS of pain from “extreme” to “weak” (P ≤  0. 001).

40|$|Despite the multifactorial {{nature of}} {{musculoskeletal}} disease, obesity consistently {{emerges as a}} key and potentially modifiable risk factor in the onset and progression of musculoskeletal conditions of the hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>ankle,</b> <b>foot</b> and shoulder. To date, the majority of {{research has focused on}} the impact of obesity on bone and joint disorders, such as the risk of fracture and osteoarthritis. However, emerging evidence indicates that obesity may also {{have a profound effect on}} soft-tissue structures, such as tendon, fascia and cartilage. Although the mechanism remains unclear, the functional and structural limitations imposed by the additional loading of the locomotor system in obesity have been almost universally accepted to produce aberrant mechanics during locomotor tasks, thereby unduly raising stress within connective-tissue structures and the potential for musculoskeletal injury. While such mechanical theories abound, there is surprisingly little scientific evidence directly linking musculoskeletal injury to altered biomechanics in the obese. For the most part, even the biomechanical effects of obesity on the locomotor system remain unknown. Given the global increase in obesity and the rapid rise in musculoskeletal disorders, there is a need to determine the physical consequences of continued repetitive loading of major structures of the locomotor system in the obese and to establish how obesity may interact with other factors to potentially increase the risk of musculoskeletal disease...|$|R
5000|$|The biggest {{difference}} in play on artificial turf {{was that the}} ball bounced higher than on real grass, and also travelled faster, causing infielders to play farther back than they would normally, {{so that they would}} have sufficient time to react. The ball also had a truer bounce than on grass, so that on long throws fielders could deliberately bounce the ball in front of the player they were throwing to, with the certainty that it would travel in a straight line and not be deflected to the right or left. However, the biggest impact on the game of [...] "turf", as it came to be called, was on the bodies of the players. The artificial surface, which was generally placed over a concrete base, had much less give to it than a traditional dirt and grass field did, which caused more wear-and-tear on <b>knees,</b> <b>ankles,</b> <b>feet</b> and the lower back, possibly even shortening the careers of those players who played a significant portion of their games on artificial surfaces. Players also complained that the turf was much hotter than grass, sometimes causing the metal spikes to burn their feet, or plastic ones to melt. These factors eventually provoked a number of stadiums, such as Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, to switch from artificial turf back to natural grass.|$|R
