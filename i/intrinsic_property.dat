The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> show linear relationship with spontaneous combustion liability and therefore, identifies the factors affecting spontaneous combustion of these materials. The influence of coal-shales <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> towards spontaneous combustion liability shows higher correlation coefficients than the coals.

This theoretical work relates to the biological properties of neuromodulation by presynaptic and postsynaptic effects on connectivity and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> ([6]). We have previously found that highly synchronous inputs drives neurons, such that small differences in <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> disappear, while distributed inputs lets <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> determine output behavior ([5]). We choose a parametrizable two-dimensional neural oscillator model (similar to a Morris-Lecar model), to investigate the effects of changed network topology for larger collections of neurons. We focus on <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> that encode frequency-specificity. We suggest that presynaptic modulation can be an effective way of rapidly altering network topology. We investigate changes in network topology along the dimensions of small-world connectivity vs. random graph connectivity. We hypothesize that SW graphs produce more globally synchronized feedforward behavior with lower link density than comparable random graphs. In accordance with the hypothesis, we find that in a SW graph, because of highly synchronous inputs, the difference between neuronal <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> is minimized, while a random graph allows read out of neuronal <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties.</b> Thus, altering network topology can alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven determined network activity. ∗ Based on a presentation at the AMS Meeting on Dynamical Neuroscience, March 2005, Santa Barbara.

Spontaneous combustion of coal has caused many mine fires leading to huge loss of coal and also loss of many human lives. Storage and transportation of coal requires knowledge about the spontaneous heating liability of coal, as it starts degrading on coming in contact with air. Numerous studies and research work has been done to understand the mechanism of spontaneous heating and its relation with coal’s <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties.</b> The present study presents the correlation of spontaneous heating susceptibility of coals belonging to different coalfields of India with their <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties.</b> The coal samples were collected from different Indian coalfields. Twelve coal samples were collected from Mahanadi Coalfield Ltd. (MCL), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL) and North Eastern Coal Fields Ltd. (NECL). The <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> were determined by carrying out – proximate analysis, Aliphaticity from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gross calorific value (GCV) using Bomb calorimetry.

The correlation of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> and susceptibility indices is done using both Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. The results for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> and the susceptibility indices are presented in table 1.

30|$|The study {{indicated}} {{that the use of}} single variable equations obtained from the linear regression analysis to predict the spontaneous combustion liability of coals and coal-shales is an unreliable method (Tables  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). This is because some properties show different trends with the spontaneous combustion liability indices (i.e. similar property may be either positive or negative on the two liability indices which is not supposed to be so in a real sense). The lack of significant relationships between all the dependent and independent variables cannot allow separation of the main <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> influencing spontaneous combustion liability. It is more likely that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> have an influence on one another to some extent during low-temperature oxidation and this dependence of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> determine the spontaneous combustion liability. This implies that the most favourable conditions for spontaneous combustion to occur likely depends on the interrelation of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties.</b> This necessitated the use of multiple regression to establish interrelationships between the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> and spontaneous combustion liability results. The multiple regression analysis was used to derive the predictive models for spontaneous combustion liability of coals and coal-shales. The predictive models were derived by using 12 independent variables. The multiple regression analysis showed that some of the variables were highly correlated with other independent variables. The best model which provides the highest R-squared values and correlation coefficient and lowest standard error of estimate was found through some multiple regression calculations (Table  8).|$|R
