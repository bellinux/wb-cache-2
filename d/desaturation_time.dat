BACKGROUNDIt has been reported that elderly patients might be more susceptible to hypoperfusion during CPB. METHODSOne hundred eighty-five patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were studied. Group 1 (n = 56) was young (70 years old). After induction of anesthesia, a fiberoptic oximetry oxygen saturation catheter was inserted into the right jugular bulb to monitor Sjvo 2 continuously. Hemodynamic variables and arterial and jugular venous blood gases were measured at seven time points. RESULTSThe cerebral <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (duration when Sjvo 2 was < 50 %) and the ratio of the cerebral <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> to the total CPB time in group 3 were significantly different from those in groups 1 and 2 (group 1 : 20 ± 6 min and 16 ± 5 %; group 2 : 19 ± 7 min and 14 ± 6 %; group 3 : 34 ± 9 min and 24 ± 7 %, respectively; p < 0. 05). Also, age (odds ratio [OR] 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 to 1. 8, p = 0. 02) and <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 1. 4, p = 0. 03) were perioperative factors in relation to short-term cognitive impairment. However, age and <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> were not perioperative factors in relation to long-term cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONSReduced Sjvo 2 was associated with short-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found {{decreases}} in arterial oxygen saturation {{to be linked to}} reductions in power output (PO). The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine how long is required to identify arterial desaturation and change pacing strategy while breathing low oxygen concentrations during simulated competition. We tested the hypothesis that the starting PO of a TT would be the same regardless of inspired F 102, due to a strong pretrial template. Trained cyclists performed randomly ordered 3 km time trials with differing patterns of low oxygen administration. The early <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> trial began 3 minutes after administration of hypoxic air; the late <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> trial began 30 seconds after administration. We saw no early effect on PO when the hypoxic condition was applied prior to the time trial, and there was no difference relative to when hypoxia was applied. The time required to decrease PO was approximately 40 seconds after the start of the trial. Despite reductions in PO, the rating of perceived exertion was greater throughout the hypoxic trial. The results support the strong effect of the pre-exercise template, and the inadequacy of matching PO to perceived exertion during the trial...|$|E
40|$|Stability {{of oxygen}} {{saturation}} depends on maturation {{and function of}} individual components of the respiratory system. The {{aim of this study}} was to record and analyse comprehensive oxygen saturation data in a longitudinal study over the first year of life. Detailed sleep studies were performed on 15 normal infants eight times in the first year of life. The accrued oxygen saturation data were analysed on a computerized oximetry data analysis system. Results show the mean sleep saturation levels trending upwards and stabilizing by 185 days. There was an inverse curvilinear relationship between mean age and median <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> and the median number of desaturations at less than or equal to 95, less than or equal to 92 and less than or equal to 90 % saturation. The mean cumulative <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> less than or equal to 90 % in the first 4 months was 11. 08 min (range 2. 5 - 36. 57 min). This study demonstrates monotonic patterns of increasing saturation and decreasing number and time of desaturations less than or equal to 95 % and less than or equal to 90 % but a random pattern of desaturations less than or equal to 85 % occurs across the first 6 months of life. Cumulative desaturation times over the first 4 months of life were high and could be important to the development of maturity of the respiratory system. After 6 months, all indices of saturation and desaturation point to a stable and mature respiratory system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{the use of}} {{propofol}} for sedation during gastrointestinal {{endoscopic procedure}} has become more popular, either by intermittent-bolus (IB) technique or target-controlled infusion (TCI). Theaim {{of this study was}} to compare the outcomes of both techniques including the total consumption of propofol, consumption per minute, total cost, side effects and its recovery time. Method: This study was a single-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted at Digestive Endoscopy Center, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta between October and November 2013. There were fifty patients with pre-operative American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Physical Status Classification I-III, aged 18 - 65 years, body mass index 18 - 30 kg/m 2 who were randomized to obtain sedation with IB propofol or TCI after having a premedication with 1 μg/kgBW fentanyl. The outcomes including the duration of sedation, total dose, propofol consumption per minute, the total cost, the incidence of hypotension, the incidence of <b>desaturation,</b> and recovery <b>time</b> were then evaluated using SPSS version 21. 0. Results: Duration of procedure between two groups was not significantly different (p = 0. 718). Total dose of propofol, its consumption per minute and total cost were higher in TCI group (p = 0. 010; p = 0. 004; p = 0. 001). The incidence of hypotension, <b>desaturation</b> and recovery <b>time</b> were not significantly different (p = 0. 248; p = 0. 609; p = 0. 33) in both groups. Conclusion: IB technique is more efficient in terms of total propofol dose, consumption per minute and total cost compared to the TCI technique.

30|$|Within groups {{comparisons}} did {{not show}} a significant interaction between time and airway pressures. The observation that airway pressures did not change significantly over time suggests that bronchospasm occurred early during the case, and treatment {{did not result in}} measurable improvement. In contrast, arterial blood gas values showed significant time effect: hypoventilation occurred in all groups and persisted over time, even though ventilation was still considered satisfactory, whereas oxygenation worsened and resulted in <b>desaturation</b> over <b>time</b> only in obese patients with bronchospasm. Bariatric surgery patients may be more susceptible to hypoventilation and impaired oxygenation, because general anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum can exaggerate the respiratory dysfunction already present in morbid obesity. General anesthesia reduces FRC by up to 20  % in healthy individuals and by up to 50  % in obese patients (Bjerkedal 1957). However, we cannot attribute this effect to bronchospasm, because airway pressures did not change significantly over time. There was no obvious synergistic effect over time in obese patients with regards to airway pressure, PaCO 2 or PaO 2, meaning that no variable changed more over time in the obese group. As discussed earlier, because the observed synergistic effect of PaO 2 over time in patients with bronchospasm was due to increasing FiO 2, this finding cannot support any valid conclusions.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The stress {{responses}} from tracheal intubation are potentially dangerous {{in patients with}} higher cardiovascular risk, such as obese patients. The primary outcome objective {{of this study was}} to test whether, in comparison with the endotracheal tube (ETT), the Proseal™ Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA™) (Laryngeal Mask Airway Company, Jersey, United Kingdom) reduces blood pressure and norepinephrine responses and the amounts of muscle relaxants needed in obese patients. METHODS: We assessed hemodynamic and hormonal stress responses, ventilation, and postoperative recovery in 75 morbidly obese patients randomized to receive standardized anesthesia with either an ETT or the PLMA™ for laparoscopic gastric banding. RESULTS: In repeated-measures ANOVA, mean arterial blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine were significantly higher in the ETT group than in the PLMA™ group. In individual pairwise comparisons, blood pressure rose higher in ETT than PLMA™ patients after insertion and removal of airway devices, and after recovery. In ETT compared with PLMA™ patients, plasma norepinephrine was higher after induction of carboperitoneum (mean ± SD, 534 ± 198 and 368 ± 147 and pg/ml, P = 0. 001), after airway device removal (578 ± 285 and 329 ± 128 pg/ml, P < 0. 0001), and after recovery in postanesthesia care unit (380 ± 167 and 262 ± 95 and pg/ml, P = 0. 003). Compared with use of the ETT, the PLMA™ reduced cisatracurium requirement, oxygen <b>desaturation,</b> and <b>time</b> to discharge from both the postanesthesia care unit and the hospital.

40|$|Propofol is an {{intravenous}} anesthetic. Currently, it is {{not possible}} to routinely measure blood concentration of the drug in real time. However, multi-capillary column ion-mobility spectrometry of exhaled gas can estimate blood propofol concentration. Unfortunately, adhesion of volatile propofol on plastic materials complicates measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the extent to which volatile propofol adheres to various plastics used in sampling tubing. Perfluoralkoxy (PFA), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyurethane (PUR), silicone, and Tygon tubing were investigated in an experimental setting using a calibration gas generator (HovaCAL). Propofol gas was measured for one hour at 26 °C, 50 °C, and 90 °C tubing temperature. Test tubing segments were then flushed with N 2 to quantify desorption. PUR and Tygon sample tubing absorbed all volatile propofol. The silicone tubing reached the maximum propofol concentration after 119 min which was 29 min after propofol gas exposure stopped. The use of PFAor PTFE tubing produced comparable and reasonably accurate propofol measurements. The <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> for the PFA was 10 min shorter at 26 °C than for PTFE. PFA tubing thus seems most suitable for measurement of volatile propofol,with PTFE as an alternative...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Sleep {{breathing}} disorders {{occur in}} 45 % {{of patients with}} heart failure, with 36 %- 50 % manifesting Cheyne-Stokes respiration with central sleep apnea and 12 % exhibiting obstructive sleep apnea. Several {{studies have shown that}} sleep pathophysiology may negatively affect the cardiovascular system and that cardiac dysfunction alters sleep and respiration. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) using overnight pulse oximetry. Methods: Overnight pulse oximetry was conducted in the patients' homes with wrist pulse oximeters and finger probes that were placed around the forefingers of 15 patients with CHF and ejection fractions less than 50 %, who were classified as New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. Results: The patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of seven patients with oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices of over 5 events/h, and the second group contained eight patients with oxyhemoglobin desaturation indices of 5 or less events/h. Student's t-tests did not show any significant differences between the groups. The patients' body mass indices correlated positively with the total desaturation episodes and <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> less than 90 % and correlated negatively with the arterial oxygen saturation nadir.

40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) {{is characterized by}} repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) increases platelet activation and has been reported as an inde-pendent predictor of adverse outcomes {{in the general population}} and is believed to be associated with cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality. We evaluated RDW, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) as a severity index in OSAS and the relationship between carotid intima media thickness and pul-monary hypertension. Material/Methods: The study population consisted of 99 patients who were admitted to the sleep laboratory. Based on the apnea-hypopnea index, patients were grouped into 3 OSAS severity categories. Morning blood samples were with-drawn from patients after a 12 -hour fasting period. MPV, PDW, and RDW were measured in a blood sample. Bilateral common carotid arteries of the patients were scanned. Results: Ninety-nine patients – 73 with OSAS and 26 simple snoring control cases – were included. Mean values of MPV, PDW, and RDW were similar in patients compared to simple snoring subjects in the control group (p= 0. 162, p= 0. 656, p= 0. 091).

40|$|Background and Aims: Apnoeic {{oxygenation}} during laryngoscopy {{has been}} emphasised in recent recommendations for airway management. We aimed {{to compare the}} effect of nasal oxygen supplementation on time for pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2) to fall from 100 % to 92 % (<b>desaturation</b> safety <b>time),</b> to assess the arterial oxygen partial pressures (PaO 2) with and without nasal oxygen supplementation and the time for SpO 2 to recover from 92 % to 100 % after initiation of ventilation. Methods: This is a prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial involving sixty patients, where nasal oxygen supplementation given at 10 L/min during apnoea of laryngoscopy in one group of patients (Group O 2) was compared to no oxygen supplementation in other group (Group NoO 2). Desaturation safety period and the PaO 2 just after intubation were compared. Time for SpO 2 to increase to 100 % after initiation of ventilation was also assessed. Demographic details were compared using the Chi-square and t-tests. Student's t-test for independent variables {{was used to compare}} means of data obtained. Results: Desaturation safety period at 415. 46 ± 97. 23 seconds in group O 2 versus 378. 69 ± 89. 31 seconds in group NoO 2 (P = 0. 213) and PaO 2 (P = 0. 952) and time to recovery of SpO 2 (P = 0. 058) were similar in both groups. Rise in arterial carbon dioxide secondary to apnoea was slower in oxygen supplementation group (P = 0. 032). Conclusion: Apnoeic oxygen supplementation at 10 L/min flow by nasal prong did not significantly prolong the apnoea desaturation safety periods or the PaO 2 in our study...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARYIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that nocturnal desaturation (NOD) in patients with chronic bronchitis emphysema (CBE) and basal hypoxemic levels greater than 55 mmHg can be related to the installation of a sustained pulmonary hypertension (PH). In this study the relationships between different NOD parameters and basal respiratory function and the relationships between NOD and PH, were evaluated. Thirty-six patients with CBE and basal stabilised PaO 2 55 - 70 mmHg were submitted to right heart cathetherization and to polysomnographic study. Fourteen patients were excluded (6 because of sleep apnoea syndrome and 8 because of left ventricular dysfunction). From the different parameters of nocturnal desaturation evaluated in the remaining 22 patients (12 men; 10 women; mean age= 67 ± 8. 6 years; mean FEV 1 =l, 1 ± 0, 42 L; 47, 9 ± 19, 3 % predicted; mean PaO 2 = 61, 5 I± 3, 8 mmHg) only those related to the <b>time</b> spent in <b>desaturation</b> (mean nocturnal <b>desaturation</b> and <b>time</b> spent with SaO 2 < 90 %) showed significant correlation with basal PaO 2, PaCO 2 e SaO 2 Using the time spent with a SaO 2 < 90 % greater than 30 % of the total sleep time as a definition of NOD, 50 % of the patients were nocturnal desaturators: basal PaCO 2 was significantly higher in these patients (44, 9 ± 2, 3 vs. 40, 9 ± 4, 3; p < 0, 05). Eleven patients (50 %) presented with PH: basal SaO 2 was significant lower in these patients (89, 8 ± 1, 6 vs. 91, 7 ± 1, 2; p< 0, 05). We conclude that: 1) NOD is frequent in patients with CBE and PaO 2 55 - 70 mmHg; 2) tile different desaturation indices are not related with the same basal functional status; 3) the <b>time</b> spent in <b>desaturation</b> is related to the basal level of hypoventilation; 4) probably, NOD {{it is not the only}} factor related to the presence of PH in these patients...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{delicate}} balance between too little and too much supplemental oxygen exposure in premature infants. Since underuse and overuse of supplemental oxygen can harm premature infants, oxygen saturation levels must be monitored and kept at less than 95 % to prevent reactive oxygen species-related diseases, such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>desaturation</b> below 80 to 85 % must be avoided to prevent adverse consequences, such as cerebral palsy. It is still unclear what range of oxygen saturation is appropriate for premature infants; however, until the results of further studies are available, a reasonable target for pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2) is 90 to 93 % with an intermittent review of the correlation between SpO 2 and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2). Because optimal oxygenation depends on individuals at the bedside making ongoing adjustments, each unit must define an optimal target range and set alarm limits {{according to their own}} equipment or conditions.

40|$|Recurrent hypoxia, {{which is}} {{associated}} with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), leads {{to an increase in}} the degradation of adenosine triphosphatase into xanthine, which in turn increases uric acid concentrations. The current study aimed to determine whether an association exists between OSAS and uric acid levels in the peripheral blood from a representative population of Sao Paulo (Brazil). A population-based survey adopting a probabilistic 3 -stage cluster sample of Sao Paulo was used to represent the population according to gender, age, and socioeconomic class. A total of 1, 042 volunteers underwent polysomnography recordings for OSAS diagnosis, blood pressure assessment, and biochemical blood analysis, and answered questionnaires. Uric acid levels were correlated with most important risk factors for OSAS, such as AHI, <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> and index, minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO 2), blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, triglycerides and arousal, and with OSAS itself. Also, uric acid was increased in OSAS volunteers even after controlling for all confounders. Hyperuricemic volunteers presented lower mean and minimum SpO 2 and increased desaturation index. Importantly, minimum SpO 2 {{was a significant predictor of}} uric acid levels, which in turn was considered an independent predictor for OSAS in the binary logistic model. However, a ROC curve analysis for establishing cut-off points for uric acid levels as a biomarker of OSAS revealed moderate sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{metabolic}} syndrome (MS) prevalence {{in patients with}} obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and to evaluate the relationship between sleep parameters and MS incidence. Materials and Methods: Included {{in this study were}} 101 patients with complaints of snoring, witnessed apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and no prior OSAS diagnosis. An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score ≥ 5 was required for the diagnosis of OSAS. The patient group included 80 cases, and the control group (AHI < 5) included 21 cases. MS diagnosis was based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Results: MS was diagnosed in 33. 3 % of controls (7 / 21) and in 66. 3 % of OSAS patients (53 / 80) (p= 0. 006). The MS frequency was 51. 7 % (15 / 29) in mild OSAS (AHI 5 - 14), 77. 8 % (14 / 18) in moderate OSAS (AHI 15 - 29. 9), and 72. 7 % (24 / 33) in severe OSAS (AHI ≥ 30). In patients with oxygen <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (ODT) < 5. 75 minutes, the MS frequency was 38. 9 %, while it was 74. 2 % in patients with ODT ≥ 5. 75 minutes (p= 0. 005). In the logistic regression analysis with multiple variables (including AHI ≥ 5, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 27 kg/m 2, age and ODT ≥ 5. 75), it was determined that ODT, age and BMI increase the risk of MS independent of other risk factors. Conclusions: We found that ODT, age and BMI, which are independent of other risk factors, are determinants of MS in patients with OSAS. Additionally, the time of hypoxia, which is independent of AHI, also increases the risk of MS. Turk Jem 2008; 12 : 63 -...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to assess the impact of}} prevention of bradycardia with physiologic pacing on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. BackgroundApneic episodes during sleep are associated with slowing of the heart rate during apnea and tachycardia with subsequent arousal. Patients with permanent pacemakers may have reduced episodes of sleep apnea when their pacemaker rate is set faster than their spontaneous nocturnal heart rate. MethodsWe conducted a prospective, randomized, single-blind crossover trial of temporary atrial pacing in obstructive sleep apnea to reduce the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Fifteen patients (age 60 ± 13 years, 12 men) with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHI 34 ± 14) underwent insertion of an externalized atrial permanent pacing system via the left subclavian vein. Patients underwent overnight respiratory sleep studies in hospital, during atrial pacing at 75 beats/min, and with pacing turned off. The order of pacing mode was randomized, with crossover the subsequent night to the other mode. Patients were blinded to pacing mode, and the analysis of sleep recordings was blind to pacing mode. ResultsPacing was tolerated without complications in all patients. Overnight physiologic pacing did not affect the AHI (pacing 39 ± 21 /h vs. control 42 ± 21 /h, p = 0. 23, 95 % confidence interval − 9. 3 to 2. 5 for difference), <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (pacing 3. 8 ± 6. 0 % vs. control 3. 5 ± 4. 3 %, p = 0. 70), or the minimum SaO 2 (pacing 75 ± 10 % vs. control 77 ± 11 %, p = 0. 38). There was a borderline significant reduction in circulatory time with pacing (pacing 23. 4 ± 3. 2 s vs. control 25. 5 ± 4. 4 s, p = 0. 09).

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative roles and interaction of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and obesity on interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort. SETTING: The Icelandic Sleep Apnea Cohort. PARTICIPANTS: 454 untreated OSA patients (380 males and 74 females), mean ± standard deviation age 54. 4 ± 10. 6 yr. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants underwent a sleep study, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging to measure total abdominal and visceral fat volume, and had fasting morning IL- 6 and CRP levels measured in serum. A significantly higher correlation was found for BMI than visceral fat volume with CRP and IL- 6 levels. Oxygen <b>desaturation</b> index, hypoxia <b>time,</b> and minimum oxygen saturation (SaO₂) significantly correlated with IL- 6 and CRP levels, but apnea-hypopnea index did not. When stratified by body mass index (BMI) category, OSA severity was associated with IL- 6 levels in obese participants only (BMI > 30 kg/m²). A multiple linear regression model with interaction terms showed an independent association of OSA severity with IL- 6 levels and an interaction between OSA severity and BMI, i. e., degree of obesity altered the relationship between OSA and IL- 6 levels. An independent association of OSA severity with CRP levels was found for minimum SaO₂ only. A similar interaction of OSA severity and BMI on CRP levels was found for males and postmenopausal women.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Induction of {{anaesthesia}} causes significant macrohaemodynamic changes, {{but little}} is known about its effects on the microcirculation. However, alterations in microvascular perfusion are known to be associated with impaired tissue oxygenation and organ dysfunction. Microvascular reactivity can be assessed with vascular occlusion testing, which evaluates the response of tissue oxygen saturation to transient ischaemia and reperfusion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of an opioid-based anaesthesia induction on microvascular reactivity. We hypothesised that despite minimal blood pressure changes, microvascular function would be impaired. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Single-centre, tertiary university teaching hospital, Belgium. PATIENTS: Thirty-five adult patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. INTERVENTION: Microvascular reactivity was assessed before and 30 min after anaesthesia induction by means of vascular occlusion testing and near-infrared spectroscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tissue oxygen saturations, <b>desaturation</b> rate, recovery <b>time</b> (time from release of cuff to the maximum value) and rate of recovery were determined. RESULTS: Data are expressed as median (minimum to maximum). Tissue oxygen saturation was higher after induction of anaesthesia [70 (54 to 78) vs. 73 (55 to 94) %, P = 0. 015]. Oxygen consumption decreased after induction, appreciable by the higher minimum tissue oxygen saturation [45 (29 to 69) vs. 53 (28 to 81) %, P < 0. 001] and the slower desaturation rate [11 (4 to 18) vs. 9 (5 to 16) % min(- 1), P < 0. 001]. After induction of anaesthesia, recovery times were longer [40 (20 to 120) vs. 48 (24 to 356) s, P = 0. 004] and the rate of recovery was lower [114 (12 to 497) vs. 80 (3 to 271) % min(- 1), P < 0. 001].

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in young patients from an urban European city with many migrants. Methods: The medical data of 2, 343 patients referred for polysomnography from January 2007 till September 2009 were retrospectively reviewed in order to identify patients younger than 40 years with OSA and assess their characteristics. Results: One hundred twenty-one of the 2, 093 patients (6 %) referred for diagnostic polysomnography were younger than 40 years and had OSA. There were 17 women and 104 men. The race was Caucasian in 55 % (67 / 121) and African in 42 % (51 / 121). The median apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 39 in men and 23 in women (p < 0. 01), 30 in Caucasians and 39 in Africans (p = 0. 03). BMI was positively correlated to the AHI (correlation of 0. 19, p = 0. 04). Multiple regression modeling showed that African origin (p = 0. 01), current smoking (p = 0. 05), and neck circumference (p < 0. 01) were predictors of AHI, independently of BMI, but not the presence of upper airway abnormalities (p = 0. 75). Co-morbidities were frequent (hypertension, 20 %; diabetes, 13 %; hypercholesterolemia, 27 %; depression, 13 %; reflux and gastric ulcer, 13 %; hypothyroidism, 5 %; asthma, 9 %), and were related to BMI (p = 0. 02), nocturnal <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (p = 0. 02), and African origin (p = 0. 024). Conclusions: In patients aged < 40 years and suffering from OSA, disease severity was associated with high BMI, large neck circumference, male sex, and African origin. After adjustment for BMI, African origin, tobacco use, and neck circumference remained predictors of high AHI. Neither upper airway abnormalities nor co-morbidities were found to be a risk factor for higher AHI in this group of young patients from a European city. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} implicated {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) as an {{independent}} comorbid factor in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The recurrent episodes of occlusion of upper airways during sleep result in pathophysiological changes that may predispose to vascular diseases, and we postulate that nitric oxide {{may be one of}} the mediators involved. This study investigates the levels of circulating nitric oxide (NO), measured as serum nitrites and nitrates, in the early morning in OSA subjects compared with control subjects, and the effect of overnight nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in OSA subjects. Thirty men with moderate to severe OSA (age = 41. 9 ± 9. 0; apnea-hypopnea index, AHI = 48. 0 ± 18. 1) were compared with 40 healthy men (age = 40. 6 ± 5. 4; AHI = 1. 4 ± 1. 2). Serum nitrite/nitrate levels were significantly lower in OSA subjects (OSA = 38. 9 ± 22. 9 μM, control subjects = 63. 1 ± 47. 5 μM, p = 0. 015). There was significant negative correlation between serum nitrites/nitrates and the following parameters: AHI (r = - 0. 389, p = 0. 001), oxygen <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (r = - 0. 346, p = 0. 004), and systolic blood pressure (BP) (r = - 0. 335, p = 0. 005). Stepwise multiple linear regression with systolic or diastolic BP as the dependent variable identified serum nitrites/nitrates as the only significant correlate. Twenty-two OSA subjects had measurements of serum NO at baseline and after an overnight application nCPAP. There was significant increase in serum NO after nCPAP (baseline = 30. 5 ± 14. 4 μM, after nCPAP = 81. 0 ± 82. 1 μM, p = 0. 01). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that circulating NO is suppressed in OSA, and this is promptly reversible with the use of nCPAP. The findings offer support for nitric oxide being one of the mediators involved in the acute hemodynamic regulation and long-term vascular remodeling in OSA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} penile rigidity {{during sleep}} {{and the relationship}} of sleep abnormalities with priapism in adults with sickle cell disease. Materials and Methods: This was a case-control study of 18 patients with sickle cell disease and a history of priapism during the previous year, and 16 controls with sickle cell disease. Participants underwent overnight polysomnography and RigiScan (R) Plus recording to detect penile rigidity oscillations. Results: the priapism group (cases) showed a higher apnea-hypopnea index and oxyhemoglobin desaturation parameters than controls. A lower positive correlation between the apnea-hypopnea index and oxyhemoglobin <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> was observed in cases than in controls (Spearman coefficient rho = 0. 49, p = 0. 05 vs rho = 0. 76, p < 0. 01), suggesting that desaturation events occurred independently of apnea. Two controls and 14 cases had a total sleep time that was greater than 10 % with oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90 % but without CO 2 retention. Penile rigidity events were observed during rapid eye movement sleep and during stage 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep, particularly in cases. the duration of penile rigidity events concomitant to respiratory events was higher in cases than in controls. Regression analysis revealed that the periodic limb movement and desaturation indexes were associated with priapism after adjusting for rapid eye movement sleep and lung involvement. Finally, oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90 % was associated with priapism after adjusting for lung involvement, hyperhemolysis and the apnea-hypopnea index. Conclusions: Oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep was associated with priapism history. It may underlie the distribution pattern of penile rigidity events during sleep in these patients.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: COPD {{patients}} run a risk {{of developing}} nocturnal oxygen desaturation. When evaluating patients with nocturnal hypoxemia, an unfamiliar hospital environment and the monitoring equipment may cause sleep disturbances. It was hypothesized that increased sleep disruption will lead to fewer instances of desaturation during a night of monitoring. DESIGN:The following forms of monitoring were evaluated prospectively on 3 nights for each patient: oximetry at home; polysomnography (PSG) at home; and PSG in the hospital. SETTING: Department of Pulmonology, Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Fourteen stable COPD patients (7 men; median age, 71. 5 years; age range, 59 to 81 years; FEV(1), 32. 5 % predicted; FEV(1) range, 19 to 70 % predicted) participated in the study. All subjects had significant instances of nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation. Those patients with a sleep-related breathing disorder or cardiac failure {{were excluded from the}} study. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) level was higher during PSG monitoring at home (89. 7 %; range, 77 to 93 %) than during oximetry monitoring (88. 5 %; range, 80 to 92 %) [p 4 %) was lower during PSG monitoring at home (22. 1 %; range, 3 to 63 %) during PSG monitoring at home than during oximetry monitoring (50. 4 %; range, 4 to 91 %) [p < 0. 01]. A correction for actual sleep during PSG monitoring reduced the differences between PSG monitoring at home and oximetry monitoring, although a difference in the <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> remained (PSG monitoring at home, 31. 9 % [range, 2 to 75 %]; oximetry monitoring, 50. 4 % [range, 4 to 91 %]) [p = 0. 041]. A comparison of sleep architectures for nights when PSG was being monitored showed a higher arousal index in the hospital than at home (PSG monitoring in the hospital, 5. 6 arousals per hour [range, 2 to 16 arousals per hour]; PSG monitoring at home, 2. 5 arousals per hour [range, 1 to 6 arousals per hour]) [p < 0. 025], but no differences in SaO(2) levels were found between PSG monitoring at home and PSG monitoring in the hospital. CONCLUSION: The artifacts due to sleep-monitoring equipment may cause an underestimation of the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia in COPD patients. The addition of an unfamiliar environment causes more sleep disruption, but this does not affect nocturnal SaO(2) levels further...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Descrever as características clínicas de lactentes com bronquiolite viral aguda (BVA) e verificar a influência do tempo de dessaturação de oxigênio (TD) como teste preditivo para estimar a evolução desses pacientes. MÉTODOS: Estudo de coorte realizado com 111 lactentes hospitalizados com diagnóstico de BVA e em oxigenoterapia por cateter nasal. Os desfechos foram: tempo de internação, tempo de oxigenoterapia e tempo para saturar 95 % em ar ambiente. Foi aplicado, duas vezes ao dia, um escore de gravidade com os sinais clínicos verificados durante o período em que o paciente necessitou de oxigênio suplementar. Após {{suspender}} o oxigênio do paciente, foi observado o tempo necessário para a saturação transcutânea de oxigênio decrescer até 90 % e 85 %. Utilizou-se o teste do qui-quadrado ou teste exato de Fisher, para comparar entre si os grupos de variáveis categóricas, e o teste t ou Mann-Whitney, para as variáveis numéricas. A correlação de Spearman foi utilizada para avaliar associações entre variáveis contínuas de distribuição assimétrica. RESULTADOS: Houve predominância de idade inferior a quatro meses (61, 3 %). Os pacientes com história de sibilância prévia (45 %) foram analisados separadamente e tiveram resultados semelhantes ao grupo com BVA (p OBJECTIVE: To {{describe the}} clinical characteristics of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB) {{and to assess}} the influence of oxygen <b>desaturation</b> <b>time</b> (DT) as a prognostic test to estimate the evolution of such patients. METHODS: We performed a cohort study with 111 hospitalized patients diagnosed with AVB receiving oxygen therapy through nasal prong. The outcomes were: length of admission, length of oxygen therapy and time elapsed to read 95 % saturation in room air. A severity score was obtained twice a day based on clinical signs during {{the time when the}} patient required oxygen supplementation. After the supply of oxygen was interrupted, the time required for transcutaneous oxygen saturation decreased to 90 % and 85 %. The chi 2 test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare categorical variables. The t test or Mann-Whitney's test were used for numerical variables. Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate associations in continuous variables with asymmetric distribution. RESULTS: Most patients (61. 3 %) were younger than 4 months. Patients with wheezing history (45 %) were analyzed separately and had similar results to those of the group with AVB (p< 0. 05). Twenty-six patients (23 %) had moderate or severe malnutrition. All patients were using bronchodilators; 20 % were using systemic corticosteroids; and 47 %, antibiotics. The median time of oxygen therapy required for a reading of 95 % oxygen saturation in room air was 83 hours (IQI 55 - 128). The median of length of admission was 7 days (IQI 5 - 10. 5). Little clinical variability was observed in the period studied. No significant correlations were found between the clinical scores, DT and the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: DT was not useful as an aid to assess AVB patients on oxygen therapy in this study. It is possible that this tool could have been more useful in patients with more clinical variability...|$|E
