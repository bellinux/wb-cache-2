40|$|Recent {{work has}} called into {{question}} {{the reality of the}} rare male mating advantage, pointing out that it could be a statistical artifact of marking flies for behavioral observation or of experimental bias in collecting males. We designed an experiment to test for rare male mating advantage that avoids these sources of bias. Large numbers of males of three Drosophila pseudoobscura karyotypes were allowed to mate with females of one karyotype in population cages. The females were then isolated before multiple mating occurred and their progeny used to diagnose the males that mated them. Populations were studied at five sets of male karyotypic frequencies. The mating success of the male homokaryotypes ST/ST and CH/CH, relative to that of the <b>heterokaryotype</b> ST/CH, was frequency dependent. Both ST/ST and CH/CH males displayed a statistically significant mating advantage at low frequency by comparision with their mating success in the midrange of karyotypic frequencies. Both male homokaryotypes also showed a significantly greater mating success at high homokaryotypic frequency than at intermediate frequencies, which is the same as saying that the <b>heterokaryotype</b> not only failed to show a rare male advantage but actually suffered a mating disadvantage at low frequency. We conclude that rare male mating advantage is not always an experimental or methodological artifact but does occur in laboratory populations of D. pseudoobscura. It may occur for some genotypes and not for others, however, and it may be only one of several forms of frequency-dependent mating behavior operating in a population...|$|E

Monozygocity was revealed by QF-PCR showing identical short tandem repeat markers on chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. The twins were heterokaryotypic for duplication chromosome 2 q 13 -q 23. 3, as shown by array comparative genomic hybridization. Selective foeticide was performed.

40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{worldwide}} latitudinal distribution and seasonal fluctuations in In(2 L) t frequencies in Drosophila melanogaster, fitness differences among In(2 L) t and Standard (ST) homo-and heterokaryotypes under high-temperature conditions were determined. Viabilities were measured for high-temperature treatment started at different juvenile stages. The capacity to restore fertility after high-temperature treatment was measured for adults and juveniles. Furthermore, genetic adaptation for increased temperature resistance for these traits was determined for strains which were reared at 33 degrees C for 10 generations. Whereas larva-pupa survival rates were high, highest juvenile mortalities and strongest karyotypic effects were observed during the pupal stage when preceding larval stages were reared at 33 degrees C. ST karyotypes showed lowest viabilities. Although mating rate was hardly influenced, sterility was induced for females and males after high-temperature treatment of adults as well as juveniles. Subsequent transfer to 25 degrees C, however, resulted in restored fertility {{in some of the}} individuals, depending on the length of the recovery period. Fertility restoration was significantly higher for <b>heterokaryotype</b> males and females. <b>Heterokaryotype</b> superiority for restored fertility as well as for viability was positively correlated with severity of the treatment. Tell generations of selection at 33 degrees C resulted in significant improvement of juvenile survival and fertility restoration for all karyotypes. These fitness components were positively correlated (r = 0. 91; P < 0. 001), which might suggest pleiotropic effects. It is concluded that the capacity to restore fertility after heat stress is an important fitness component, especially with respect to the In(2 L) r polymorphism The observed heterokaryotypic superiority fits with the idea that the latitudinal distribution of In(2 L) t frequencies is maintained by balancing selection, with equilibrium values decreasing with latitude...|$|E
40|$|In the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, {{alternative}} {{arrangements of}} chromosome 2 (2 La and 2 L+a) vary in relative frequency along clines of aridity, suggesting {{the action of}} natural selection on targets within the inversion.

Accordingly, we estimated recombination rates on 2 L from the backcross progeny of 2 La/+a <b>heterokaryotypes</b> and as a control, from 2 L+a homokaryotypes. In homokaryotypes, the recombination rate was uniform at ~ 2. 0 centimorgans per megabase (cM/Mb). In <b>heterokaryotypes,</b> recombination within the rearranged region was reduced to < 0. 5 cM/Mb, with slightly higher but nevertheless reduced levels (< 1. 0 cM/Mb) flanking the rearrangement. Yet, gene exchange was recorded between nearly all markers, including those very near the distal inversion breakpoint. These results suggest that reduced recombination is a necessary but not sufficient mechanism for genetic isolation between alternative arrangements, and that the targets of natural selection can be identified against the different chromosomal backgrounds...|$|R

In all populations studied it is polymorphic for two gene arrangements on Chromosome I. A polymorphism at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus is {{strongly associated with}} this inversion {{and can be used}} to estimate karyotype frequencies. An extensive series of samples from natural populations has revealed a seasonal cycle in inversion frequencies but otherwise frequencies are remarkable constant both geographically and temporally. There is a consistent excess of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> in these samples. Three selective forces influencing inversion frequencies have been investigated. 1) An association between karyotype and development time, previously observed in the laboratory, has been demonstrated in conditions case to those in natural populations. 2) Viability differences between karyotypes have been examined. In natural populations {{there is some evidence that}} the excess of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> increases with larval density. In the laboratory <b>heterokaryotypes</b> are shown to have higher viability than either homokaryotype but the strong density dependence reported previously has not been observed. Viability differences are concentrated in the first two days of larval life and are probably related to the rate of supply of nutrients. 3) An association is demonstrated between karyotype and adult size – especially in males. Adult size is shown to correlate with longevity and fecundity of both sexes. Several experiments indicate that large males enjoy greater mating success than small males. The relationship between larval density, development time and adult size is described. The possibility that the effect of the inversion varies between populations or between alcohol dehydrogenase genotypes has also been investigated. A simulation has been used to study how these selective forces interact with one another, and with the changeable environment in which the flies live, and to examine the extent to which they can account for the observed karyotype frequencies...|$|R

The {{results showed that}} their competitive population cage performances were correlated to their viabilities as homozygotes but were not correlated to their viabilities as heterozygotes or as <b>heterokaryotypes.</b> However, the results do not fit in too simply with the mutational model of population structure, since the improvement of homozygous viability with increased competitive fitness was not accompanied by a significant degree of dominance {{as measured by the}} regression of viabilities of heterozygotes on homozygotes. Only the AR chromosomes derived from the population with poorest competitive fitness showed marked partial dominance (h=. 35). The viabilities of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> were markedly uniform for all chromosomes tested and produced significantly greater numbers of flies per culture than the homokaryotypes. In general, the results show that the ranking of relative competitive fitnesses of these chromosomes is not a simple extrapolation of their viabilities, although marked changes in the populations tested have occurred. It is proposed that the differences in competitive fitness, homozygous viability, and degree of dominance observed among these chromosomes, arise from differences in genetic variability which enable different linkage relationships to be established for genes affecting these attributes...|$|R
40|$|In {{a natural}} {{population}} of Drosophila persimilis (McDonald Ranch, Napa Valley, California), KL and MD chromosomal arrangement frequencies undergo a seasonal cycle, with MD common {{in spring and}} KL common in summer. Samples collected from spring and summer provided isofemale strains established as homozygous KL and MD pairs (kinlines) with each pair derived from a single <b>heterokaryotype</b> wild progenitor. Haploid doses of chromosomes 2 and 4 were controlled by marker-cross derivations of kinlines. Percentage onset of female receptivity was measured from cultures at 25 ° and at 15 °, using ten kinlines from spring and nine from summer collections, with fast-mating hybrid males as standard testers. Mating tests consisted of 20 tester males x 20 females of specific age, karyotype, and kinline observed for 30 min. At 25 ° females became receptive at 48 hr after eclosion: parental line (KLi/KLi and MDi/MDi) females were approximately equal at 55 to 60 % receptive, while among hybrids, MDi/MDj homokaryotype females were significantly less receptive (68 %) than all other outbred combinations (73 to 77 %). At 15 °, females became receptive at four days of age, with increases on the fifth and sixth days: both parental line and outbred MD/MD females were significantly more receptive (28 % at four days and 62 % at six days) than all <b>heterokaryotype</b> females (20 to 26 % at four days and 55 to 59 % at six days), which in turn were more receptive than KL/KL parental and outbred females (10 % at four days and 40 % at six days). Heterosis was expressed at 25 °, but not at 15 °. Thus, dominance for female receptivity was temperature dependent.

40|$|How polymorphisms are {{maintained}} within populations {{over long periods}} of time remains debated, because genetic drift and various forms of selection are expected to reduce variation. Here, we study the genetic architecture and maintenance of phenotypic morphs that confer crypsis in Timema cristinae stick insects, combining phenotypic information and genotyping-by-sequencing data from 1360 samples across 21 populations. We find two highly divergent chromosomal variants that span megabases of sequence and are associated with color polymorphism. We show that these variants exhibit strongly reduced effective recombination, are geographically widespread, and probably diverged millions of generations ago. We detect <b>heterokaryotype</b> excess and signs of balancing selection acting on these variants through the species' history. A third chromosomal variant in the same genomic region likely evolved more recently from one of the two color variants and is associated with dorsal pattern polymorphism.

Here we report {{the results of our}} comparative cytogenetic mapping efforts and population genetics studies focused on the genomic characterization of this balanced chromosomal polymorphism. Comparative chromosome painting and cytogenetic mapping of 15 zebra finch BAC clones to the standard (ZAL 2) and alternative (ZAL 2 m) arrangements revealed that this chromosome is orthologous to chicken chromosome 3, and that at a minimum, ZAL 2 and ZAL 2 m differ by a pair of included pericentric inversions that we estimate span at least 98 Mb. Population-based sequencing and genotyping of multiple loci demonstrated that ZAL 2 m suppresses recombination in the <b>heterokaryotype</b> and is evolving as a rare nonrecombining autosomal segment of the genome. In addition, we estimate that the first inversion within the ZAL 2 m arrangement originated 2. 2 ± 0. 3 million years ago. Finally, while previously recognized as a genetic model for the evolution of social behavior, we found that the ZAL 2 /ZAL 2 m polymorphism also shares genetic and phenotypic features with the mouse t complex and we further suggest that the ZAL 2 /ZAL 2 m polymorphism is a heretofore unrecognized model for the early stages of sex chromosome evolution...|$|E

40|$|About 20 {{years ago}} Drosophila subobscura, a native Palearctic species, colonized both North and South America. In Palearctic populations lethal genes are not {{associated}} in general with particular chromosomal arrangements. In colonizing populations {{they are not}} randomly distributed and usually are associated to a different degree with chromosomal arrangements caused by the founder event. The persistence of two lethal genes in the colonizing populations, one completely associated with the O 5 inversion and the other partially associated with the O 3 + 4 + 7 arrangement, has been analyzed. In all populations studied (five North American and six South American) the observed frequency of the lethal gene completely associated with the O 5 inversion is higher than expected, the difference being statistically significant in all South American and one North American populations. The observed frequency of the lethal gene partially associated with the O 3 + 4 + 7 arrangement is also significantly higher than expected. Taking into account that the O 5 inversion exhibits significant latitudinal clines both in North and South America, an overdominant model favoring the <b>heterokaryotypes</b> {{seems to be in}} operation. From this model, a polynomial expression has been developed that allows us to estimate the relative fitness and the coefficient of selection against all karyotypes not carrying the O 5 inversion. The relative fitness of the O 5 <b>heterokaryotypes</b> is higher in South American than in North American populations. Furthermore, the observed frequencies of the lethal genes studied are in general very close to those of the equilibrium.

40|$|Development {{time and}} body weight of In(2 L) t, R (a {{putative}} short inversion {{on the left}} arm of the second chromosome) and ST (standard) karyotypes of Drosophila melanogaster were measured at different temperatures. Frequency changes were followed in populations polymorphic for In(2 L) t and ST and kept under different environmental conditions. These experiments were carried out in order to explain the worldwide latitudinal clines for In(2 L) t and other inversions. To avoid interactions with the Adh and alpha-Gpdh loci, which also have latitudinal clines, all karyotypes were homozygous Adh(s) alpha-Gpdh(F). In(2 L) t homokaryotypes had a longer development time and a lower weight than the other karyotypes at all temperatures. R/ST <b>heterokaryotypes</b> had the shortest development time and ST/ST had the smallest weight decrease with increasing temperature. The differences among the In(2 L) t and ST karyotypes in development time were further analyzed in an experiment where {{the age at which}} 50 % of the larvae were able to become adults, without further food ingestion, was determined. In polymorphic populations at 20 -degrees and 25 -degrees a signficant decline of In(2 L) t frequencies was observed.

On ethanol-supplemented food the most drastic decline in In(2 L) t frequency was observed. Populations transferred at 2 - and 3 -week intervals at 25 -degrees exhibited large differences in final In(2 L) t frequencies. The frequency changes could in part be attributed to the differences in development time and to previously observed differences in high temperature resistance.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to {{a broader range of}} genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease <b>heterokaryotype</b> fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{populations of}} Drosophila silvestris are {{polymorphic}} for inversions {{in one or}} more of four of the five major chromosome arms; laboratory stocks tend to retain this heterozygosity. A laboratory stock, U 28 T 2, was started from a single naturally inseminated wild female caught at Kilauea Forest Reserve, Hawaii, in January 1977. Polytene analysis in 1980 showed the presence of three natural inversions in chromosome 4 : k 2 is distal, t is central and l 2 is proximal. The inversions are short but only short uncovered euchromatic sections exist at the distal and proximal ends. Periodic examinations through 1986 showed all three inversions to be persistent at moderately high frequencies. In 1984, a series of tests of mating performance of caged, mature males, taken at random as they eclosed from the stock, were followed by cytological testcrosses to females from a homokaryotypic stock. Only three of the eight possible haplotypes, k 2 /t/+ (A), +/+/l 2 (a) and +/+/+ (a') were present. Tests of crossing over show none in males; in females, there is about 1 % in each of the two regions between the inversions. Only one such apparent crossover haplotype was found among 1084 examined in samples from this stock. Thus, chromosome arrangements A, a and a' virtually behave as wholechromosome alleles in both sexes. Of 146 males marked and tested in cages, 61 produced progeny; the others failed to reproduce. Of 58 males and 80 females producing progeny and analyzed cytologically, there were, respectively, 49 and 59 <b>heterokaryotypes.</b> On the basis of frequencies calculated for fertilized eggs, 33. 6 males and 46. 3 females are expected. The facts suggest that individual males with the Aa karyotype are particularly successful in production of offspring. Adult females show an excess of Aa' as well as Aa. Such high fitness of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> in the effective breeding adults could be {{a major factor in the}} maintenance of stable chromosomal polymorphisms both in laboratory stocks and in nature.

The evidence of a lower activity of the +/+ homokaryotypes was confirmed when the mosquitoes were stimulated by a human arm.

40|$|In(2 LR) PL {{is a large}} pericentric {{inversion}} polymorphic in populations of Drosophila melanogaster on two Indian Ocean islands. This polymorphism is puzzling: because crossing over in female <b>heterokaryotypes</b> produces inviable zygotes, such inversions {{are thought to be}} underdominant and should be quickly eliminated from populations. The observed fixation for such inversions among related species has led to the idea that genetic drift can cause chromosome evolution in opposition to natural selection. We found, however, that In(2 LR) PL is not underdominant for fertility, as heterokaryotypic females produce perfectly viable eggs. Genetic analysis shows that the lack of underdominance results from the nearly complete absence of crossing over in the inverted region. This phenomenon is probably caused by mechanical and not genetic factors, because crossing over is not suppressed in In(2 LR) PL homokaryotypes. Our observations do not support the idea that the fixation of {{pericentric inversion}}s among closely related species implies the action of genetic drift overcoming strong natural selection in very small populations. If chromosome arrangements vary in their underdominance, it is those with the least disadvantage as heterozygotes, like In(2 LR) PL, that will be polymorphic or fixed in natural populations...|$|R

The location of the rp 49 gene region within the inversion loop differs among heterokaryotypes: it {{is very close to}} one of the breakpoints in heterozygotes involving Ost chromosomes, while it is in a more central position in all other <b>heterokaryotypes.</b> The distribution of nucleotide polymorphism in the different arrangements is consistent with a monophyletic origin of the inversions. The data also provide evidence that gene conversion and possibly double crossover are involved in shuffling nucleotide variation among gene arrangements. The analyses reveal that the level of genetic exchange is higher when the region is located in a more central position of the inverted fragment than when it is close to the breakpoints. The pairwise difference distributions as well as the negative values of Tajima's and Fu and Li's statistics further support the hypothesis that nucleotide variation within chromosomal arrangements still reflects expansion after the origin of the inversions.

40|$|Knowledge of {{population}} structure {{in a major}} vector species is fundamental {{to an understanding of}} malaria epidemiology and becomes crucial in the context of genetic control strategies that are being developed. Despite its epidemiological importance, the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus has received far less attention than members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Previous chromosomal data have shown a high degree of structuring within populations from West Africa and have led to the characterization of two chromosomal forms, “Kiribina” and “Folonzo. ” In Central Africa, few data were available. We thus undertook assessment of genetic structure of An. funestus populations from Cameroon using chromosomal inversions and microsatellite markers. Microsatellite markers revealed no particular departure from panmixia within each local population and a genetic structure consistent with isolation by distance. However, cytogenetic studies demonstrated high levels of chromosomal heterogeneity, both within and between populations. Distribution of chromosomal inversions was not random and a cline of frequency was observed, according to ecotypic conditions. Strong deficiency of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> was found in certain localities in the transition area, indicating a subdivision of An. funestus in chromosomal forms. An. funestus microsatellite genetic markers located within the breakpoints of inversions are not differentiated in populations, whereas in An. gambiae inversions can affect gene flow at marker loci. These results are relevant to strategies for control of malaria by introduction of transgenes into populations of vectors...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{of strong}} {{associations}} of Est- 1 alleles with the 2 L, 2 L 1 and 2 L 3 gene arrangements {{of the left}} arm of the second chromosome in D. robusta is presented. Each gene arrangement is polymorphic {{for three to four}} Est- 1 alleles. The allele frequencies differ in the 2 L 3 and 2 L arrangements; the allele Est- 1. 92 is 8 % in the 2 L 3 arrangement (n= 203) —this allele is 82 % in the 2 L arrangement (n= 203); the allele Est- 11. 0 is 66 % and 14. 8 % in the 2 L 3 and 2 L arrangements, respectively. There are no differences in allele frequencies in 2 L 3 arrangements from any of the widely separated seven different populations; similarly the allele frequencies in the 2 L arrangement are alike in all five widely separated populations studied. The allele frequencies in the 2 L 1 arrangement are intermediate to those observed in the 2 L 3 and the 2 L arrangements and show north-south clinal change. These associations between Est- 1 alleles and gene arrangements of the left arm of the second chromosome are due to natural selection favoring different allele frequencies in different gene arrangements, as a result of epistatic interactions between the Est- 1 locus and the loci on the gene arrangements. As expected, we observe that the proportion of heterozygotes is greater in the inversion <b>heterokaryotypes</b> than in the homokaryotypes...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal inversions disrupt {{recombination}} in heterozygotes by both reducing crossing-over within inverted {{regions and}} increasing it {{elsewhere in the}} genome. The reduction of recombination in inverted regions facilitates the maintenance of hybridizing species, as outlined by various models of chromosomal speciation. We present a comprehensive comparison {{of the effects of}} inversions on recombination rates and on nucleotide divergence. Within an inversion differentiating Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, we detected one double recombinant among 9, 739 progeny from F 1 hybrids screened, consistent with published double-crossover frequencies observed within species. Despite similar rates of exchange within and between species, we found no sequence-based evidence of ongoing gene exchange between species within this inversion, but significant exchange was inferred within species. We also observed greater differentiation at regions near inversion breakpoints between species versus within species. Moreover, we observed strong “interchromosomal effect” (higher recombination in inversion heterozygotes between species) with up to 9 -fold higher recombination rates along collinear segments of chromosome two in hybrids. Further, we observed that regions most susceptible to changes in recombination rates corresponded to regions with lower recombination rates in homokaryotypes. Finally, we showed that interspecies nucleotide divergence is lower in regions with greater increases in recombination rate, potentially resulting from greater interspecies exchange. Overall, we have identified several similarities and differences between inversions segregating within versus between species in their effects on recombination and divergence. We conclude that these differences are most likely due to lower frequency of <b>heterokaryotypes</b> and to fitness consequences from the accumulation of various incompatibilities between species. Additionally, we have identified possible effects of inversions on interspecies gene exchange that had not been considered previously...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal inversions impact genetic {{variation}} and facilitate speciation {{in part by}} reducing recombination in <b>heterokaryotypes.</b> We generated multiple whole-genome shotgun sequences of the parapatric species pair Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis and their sympatric outgroup (Drosophila miranda) and compared the average pairwise differences for neutral sites within, just outside and far outside of the three large inversions. Divergence between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis is high inside the inversions and in the suppressed recombination regions extending 2. 5 Mb outside of inversions, but significantly lower in collinear regions further from the inversions. We observe little evidence of decreased divergence predicted {{to exist in the}} centre of inversions, suggesting that gene flow through double crossovers or gene conversion is limited within the inversion, or selection is acting within the inversion to maintain divergence in the face of gene flow. In combination with past studies, we provide evidence that inversions in this system maintain areas of high divergence in the face of hybridization, and have done so for a substantial period of time. The left arm of the X chromosome and chromosome 2 inversions appear to have arisen in the lineage leading to D. persimilis approximately 2 Ma, near the time of the split of D. persimilis–D. pseudoobscura–D. miranda, but likely fixed within D. persimilis much more recently, as diversity within D. persimilis is substantially reduced inside and near these two inversions. We also hypothesize that the inversions in D. persimilis may provide an empirical example of the ‘mixed geographical mode’ theory of inversion origin and fixation, whereby allopatry and secondary contact both play a role...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Burkina Faso, two {{chromosomal}} {{forms of}} the malaria vector Anopheles funestus, Folonzo and Kiribina, are distinguished by contrasting frequencies of shared polymorphic chromosomal inversions. Sympatric and synchronous populations of Folonzo and Kiribina mate assortatively, as indicated by a significant deficit of <b>heterokaryotypes,</b> and genetic associations among inversions on independently segregating chromosome arms. The present study aimed to assess, by intensive longitudinal sampling, whether sympatric Folonzo and Kiribina populations are characterized by behavioural differences in key malaria vectorial parameters. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} two adjacent villages near Ouagadougou, in the dry savanna of central Burkina Faso. Mosquito adult resting behaviour of both forms was compared based on parallel indoor/outdoor collections across six breeding seasons; 8, 235 fully karyotyped samples of half-gravid females were analysed in total. Additionally, indoor/outdoor human biting behaviour, host selection, and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate was assessed and compared between chromosomal forms. Results: The Kiribina form was numerically predominant in the area. However, the Folonzo form was significantly over-represented in indoor resting collections and showed stronger post-prandial endophily, while Kiribina predominated outdoors. Neither form was statistically distinguishable in human biting behaviour, and both were more likely to seek (> 89 % and > 8 %, respectively). Conclusions: Both Kiribina and Folonzo chromosomal forms are formidable malaria vectors in Burkina Faso. However, the significantly greater tendency for the Kiribina form to rest outdoors despite its pronounced anthropophily suggests that uniform exposure of the overall An. funestus population to indoor-based vector control tools cannot be expected; Kiribina is more likely to evade indoor interventions and escape unharmed outdoors, reducing the efficacy of malaria control. Accordingly, more efficient methods to detect Kiribina and Folonzo, and a more complete understanding of their distribution and behaviour in Africa are advocated...|$|R
40|$|Different electrophoretic alleles of amylase show {{associations}} with particular chromosome 3 inversions in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. Relative adult amylase activities were compared in 37, 37 and 10 strains of D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. miranda, respectively. Strains carrying the same electrophoretic allele were compared by crossing these lines individually to a reference strain carrying a different electrophoretic mobility allele. This procedure allows comparisons among species, inversions, electromorphs and strains for genetic variation in amylase activity. F 2 analysis {{established that the}} activity variation co-segregates with the structural amylase locus. This type of variation {{could be due to}} either structural gene differences or differences in closely linked, cis-acting regulatory regions. Variation has been detected among and within electrophoretic mobility classes. Moreover, this variation is clearly nonrandom and reveals more of the genetic structure associated with the chromosomal inversion phylogeny of D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. —Some of the findings are: (1) Similar electromorphs in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis usually show different activities. These species show nearly complete differentiation of amylase alleles, based on activities. (2) D. persimilis has the broadest range of variation in amylase activity, about four-fold between the highest and lowest alleles. D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda are also polymorphic for activity, but have more constrained ranges of variation. D. miranda alleles show on the average about four times the activity of D. pseudoobscura alleles. (3) Some association of electrophoretic mobility and activity has been found. Alleles 1. 09 of D. persimilis, as well as 1. 43 and 1. 55 of D. miranda, have relatively high activity. It may be that these high activity alleles are part of an adaptation to cooler habitats. (4) Within electrophoretic classes, associations of activities with inversions have been found. These are especially strong in D. persimilis. The 1. 00 alleles in the ST, KL, MD and WT inversions, the 0. 92 allele in the ST and MD inversions and the 1. 09 allele in the WT and KL inversions have levels of activities that depend upon the arrangement in which they are located. These results demonstrate that suppression of recombination in inversion <b>heterokaryotypes</b> can result in extensive genic divergence between inversions...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{polytene}} chromosome {{studies on the}} Anopheles gambiae complex in Mali were reviewed. The banding pattern was successfully scored in 17, 705 specimens from 76 sampling sites representing the main ecological strata of the country. Two members of the complex, namely An. arabiensis and An. gambiae, were found widespread and frequently sympatric, with the latter prevalent in most localities. Population genetic analysis of the inversion polymorphisms indicated the existence of panmictic conditions for An. arabiensis only, whereas the parallel study of An. gambiae supported its splitting into at least three reproductive units, characterized by different 2 R chromosome arrangements, designated Bamako, Mopti and Savanna. The chromosomal evidence {{was consistent with the}} hypothesis of complete reproductive isolation between Bamako and Mopti. Partial isolation between these two taxa and Savanna was suggested by the scoring of hypothetical hybrid 2 R <b>heterokaryotypes</b> in various samples, but the actual hybrid origin of these specimens was not confirmed Different patterns of geographical and seasonal distribution were shown as follows. An. arabiensis prevails in arid savannas (Sahel and Northern Sudan savanna) out of the flooded or irrigated zones: it is able to withstand the most arid conditions of Saharan localities and its breeding might extend throughout the dry season. An. gambiae Savanna and Bamako prevail in relatively humid savannas (Southern Sudan savanna) and their breeding generally occurs only during the rainy season. The Savanna taxon was almost absent in flooded or irrigated zones and in riverine localities; the Bamako taxon is distributed along the upper river Niger and its tributaries. An. gambiae Mopti extends its range in all ecological zones present in Mali including the Sahel and predesertic areas, showing high relative frequencies up to absolute dominance in flooded or irrigated areas; its breeding is highly successful also during the dry season. Rainfall at the sampling sites was found to correlate positively with the frequency of Savanna and negatively with the frequency of Mopti. The remarkable ecological flexibility of the latter was found associated with wide seasonal and geographical variations in its 2 R inversion polymorphism bc/u. Higher frequencies of the be arrangement were recorded both in the Southern localities during the dry season and in the Northern more and localities during the rainy season. The absence or scarcity of An arabiensis and An. gambiae Savanna in most flooded or irrigated zones suggests their competitive exclusion by An. gambiae Mopti...|$|R
