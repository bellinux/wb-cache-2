40|$|Background. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as <b>epoetin</b> alfa and <b>beta,</b> and {{darbepoetin alfa}} have {{improved}} {{the management of}} anaemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. Numerous studies have reported a dose reduction when patients receiving dialysis were converted from epoetin to darbepoetin alfa using the starting dose conversion of 200 : 1 as indicated on the prescribing label by the European Medicines Agency. The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize the existing body of scientific evidence to evaluate the potential dose savings when comparing <b>epoetin</b> alfa or <b>beta</b> to darbepoetin alfa. Method. Medline and EmBase were searched to identify all published trials investigating ESA treatment in anaemic patients receiving dialysis and converted from epoetins to darbepoetin alfa. We selected prospective randomized controlled, non-randomized and observational studies involving patients on dialysis that compared epoetin and darbepoetin alfa dosing. Results. Of 573 articles identified, 9 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis. The overall percentage dose savings attained when dialysis patients were converted from epoetin to darbepoetin alfa was 30 % (range: 4 % 44 %). Greater dose savings were noted with intravenous administration (33 %) compared with subcutaneous (27 %) and between switch-over studies (31 %) and RCTs (27 %). In all studies, target haemoglobin levels were maintained before and after conversion. Conclusion. This meta-analysis demonstrates that when using an initial 200 : 1 conversion ratio, as indicated on the European label, from epoetin to darbepoetin, a subsequent reduction in dose was observed and an average 30 % dose savings could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anaemia is a {{risk factor}} for death, adverse {{cardiovascular}} outcomes and poor quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESA) are the most used treatment option. In observational studies, higher haemoglobin (Hb) levels (around 11 - 13 g/dL) are associated with improved survival and quality of life compared to Hb levels around 9 - 10 g/dL. Randomized studies found that targeting higher Hb levels with ESA causes an increased risk of death, mainly due to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. It is possible that this is mediated by ESA dose rather than haemoglobin concentration, although this hypothesis has never been formally tested. Methods: We present the protocol of the Clinical Evaluation of the Dose of Erythropoietins (C. E. DOSE) trial, which will assess the benefits and harms of a high versus a low ESA dose therapeutic strategy for the management of anaemia of end stage kidney disease (ESKD). This is a randomized, prospective open label blinded end-point (PROBE) design trial due to enroll 900 haemodialysis patients. Patients will be randomized 1 : 1 to 4000 UI/week i. v. versus 18000 UI/week i. v. of <b>epoetin</b> alfa, <b>beta</b> or any other epoetin in equivalent doses.

Thirty patients required blood transfusions during the year prior to the study. Mean hemoglobin concentration pretreatment was 75 g/L (range 57 - 89 g/L). Intervention: After a pretreatment period of tyro weeks, 60 IU kg- 1 week- 1 divided into three weekly doses of <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> was administered subcutaneously.

RESULTS: All patients responded rapidly to <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> treatment, showing a median Hb increase of > or = 1 g/dl from baseline at week 4. A median Hb of 12. 2, 12. 5 and 11. 8 g/dl was achieved in all patients, those receiving Pt-based CT and those receiving non-Pt-based CT, respectively, after 16 weeks of treatment. Transfusion risk reductions associated with <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> treatment of 53 % (p< 0. 0001), 61 % (p< 0. 0001) and 26 % (non significant) were observed for all patients, Pt- and non-Pt-based CT patients, respectively.

Here we provide an overview of these recent data and review the role of <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia over the past 20 years.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} recombinant human erythropoietin (<b>epoetin</b> <b>beta)</b> on anemia, trans-fusion need, {{and quality of life}} (QOL) in severely anemic patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: Transfusion-dependent pa-tients with NHL (n 106), CLL (n 126), or MM (n 117) and a low serum erythropoietin concentration were randomized to receive <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> 150 IU/kg or placebo subcutaneously three times a week for 16 weeks. Primary efficacy criteria were transfusion-free and transfusion- and severe anemia–free survival (he-moglobin [Hb]> 8. 5 g/dL) between weeks 5 to 16. Response was defined as an increase in Hb> 2 g/dL with elimination of transfusion need. QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale. Results: Transfusion-free (P. 0012) survival and transfusion- and severe anemia–free survival (P. 0001) were significantly greater in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> group ver-sus placebo (Wald 2 test), giving a relative risk reduction of 43 % and 51 %, respectively. The response rate was 67 % and 27 % in the <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> versus the placebo group, respectively (P 2 g/dL). A target Hb that could be generally recommended could not be identified. Conclusion: Many severely anemic and transfusion-dependent patients with advanced MM, NHL, and CLL and a low performance status benefited from epoetin therapy, with elimination of severe anemia and trans-fusion need, and improvement in QOL...|$|E

40|$|Anaemia has a {{detrimental}} {{impact on}} {{quality of life}} and it is important that this condition is recognised and treated in patients with cancer. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of anaemia in patients {{with a wide range of}} solid and haematological malignancies. A study in patients with lymphoid malignancies confirms that <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> is equally effective at the same overall weekly dose (30, 000 IU weekly) when given once-weekly or three-times weekly. This once-weekly regimen has also proved effective in patients with solid tumours. Once-weekly treatment is more convenient for the patient, potentially improving compliance and is associated with reduced hospital administration costs. The majority of patients with cancer will respond to epoetin therapy with an increase in haemoglobin levels. However, it is of value to identify those patients who are likely to respond, so that cost-effectiveness can be improved. Despite much research into potential predictive factors, follow-up studies are required and clinical judgement remains key to managing the anaemia of cancer. In addition, studies suggest that intravenous iron supplementation can improve response to epoetin therapy in patients with functional iron deficiency. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> offers an effective, safe and convenient therapy for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer. Ongoing studies are expected to lead to a greater understanding of the optimal use of epoetins in cancer-related anaemia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|TO THE EDITOR: It is {{appreciated}} that our {{study on the}} subject of the Epo analysis (5) has generated the much needed debate on the present World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) test proce-dure for detection of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Several interesting points have been made, includ-ing the comments of Prof. Jelkmann (see Ref. 4) arguing that at present no test is available for biosimilars of <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> or pegylated <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta,</b> and the comments by Drs. Mørkeberg, Belhage, and Damsgaard (see Ref. 4) commenting on the too-strict criteria used to judge a test result as an “adverse analytical finding. ” As suggested by Drs. Schumacher and Pottgiesser (see Ref. 4), a consequence hereof could be to consider all available information on erythropoiesis in the evaluation of an athlete. This would require introducing the so-called blood pass-port. Another consequence is for the WADA laboratories t...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epoetin</b> <b>beta,</b> three-times weekly (t. i. w.), is {{effective}} in reversing anaemia in lymphoproliferative disorders. The current study investigated whether an <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> dose of 30, 000 IU given subcutaneously once weekly (q. w.) was at least as effective as 10, 000 t. i. w. administration in anaemic patients with lymphoproliferative malignancy and defective endogenous erythropoietin (Epo) production. Overall, 241 anaemic patients with multiple myeloma, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, all with serum Epo values </= 100 mU/ml, were randomized to receive the q. w. (n = 119) or t. i. w. (n = 122) regimen for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy criterion, i. e. the time-adjusted area under the haemoglobin-time curve from weeks 5 - 16, was comparable between the q. w. and t. i. w. groups [difference = - 0. 20 g/dl (90 % confidence interval - 0. 52 - 0. 11) ]. Moreover, response rates were high and similar in both arms (72 %vs 75 %, q. w. and t. i. w. groups respectively). Baseline serum Epo was predictive of response: the lower serum Epo, the higher the likelihood of response (P = 0. 002). Thus, <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> administered q. w. is an effective and convenient treatment for anaemia in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Tailoring this treatment modality to subjects with defective endogenous Epo production represents a rational use of epoetin from both a medical and a community perspective. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Recombinant human {{erythropoietin}} (r-HuEPO) is used {{to treat}} symptomatic anaemia due to chemotherapy. A new r-HuEPO, Epoetin theta (Eporatio ®), was investigated and compared to placebo and <b>Epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in adult cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, using a fixed weekly starting dose of 20, 000 IU Epoetin theta.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of the poor {{long-term}} survival of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia complicating CKD not only impairs patients’ quality of life, but is also an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has greatly changed the management of anemia in CKD patients. Besides improving hemoglobin levels, rHuEPO therapy has been demonstrated to significantly improve quality of life and decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>beta,</b> together with epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, is one of the erythropoiesis-stimulating agents now available on the market. Different studies have shown that <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> once-weekly administration to hemodialysis patients is as effective as three-times-weekly administration in maintaining hemoglobin levels at equivalent weekly doses. This raises the possibility of reducing the frequency of administration of rHuEPO therapy, thus increasing the alternatives available for tailoring anemia therapy to patients needs, and at the same time reducing nursing times and treatment costs. This is expected to potentially enhance patient compliance, thus helping more patients achieve their target hemoglobin levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiosensitivity}} {{of solid}} tumours in anaemic rats treated with {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (rhEPO, <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta)</b> was studied. Anaemia was induced by a single dose of carboplatin (45 mg kg(- 1) i. v.), resulting in {{a reduction in the}} haemoglobin concentration by 30 %. In a second group, the development of anaemia was prevented by rhEPO (1000 IU kg(- 1)) administered s. c. three times per week starting 6 days before the carboplatin application. Three days after carboplatin treatment, DS-sarcomas were implanted subcutaneously onto the hind foot dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rhEPO treatment influenced tumour growth rate. Five days after implantation, tumours were irradiated with a single non-curative dose (10 Gy), resulting in a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumours. In the rhEPO-treated group, the growth delay lasted significantly longer (9. 5 days vs. 4. 5 days) and the regrowth was slower (6. 0 days vs. 4. 1 days) compared with the anaemic group. These data suggest that the correction of chemotherapy-induced anaemia by rhEPO (<b>epoetin</b> <b>beta)</b> treatment increases tumour radiosensitivity, presumably {{as a result of an}} improved oxygen supply to tumour tissue...|$|E
40|$|Background: Erythropoiesis {{stimulating}} agents (ESAs) {{are widely}} used to treat anaemia but concerns exist about their potential to promote pathological angiogenesis in some clinical scenarios. In the current study we have assessed the angiogenic potential of three ESAs; epoetin delta, darbepoetin alfa and <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> using in vitro and in vivo models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The epoetins induced angiogenesis in human microvascular endothelial cells at high doses, although darbepoetin alfa was pro-angiogenic at low-doses (1 – 20 IU/ml). ESA-induced angiogenesis was VEGFmediated. In a mouse model of ischaemia-induced retinopathy, all ESAs induced generation of reticulocytes but only <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> exacerbated pathological (pre-retinal) neovascularisation in comparison to controls (p, 0. 05). Only epoetin delta induced a significant revascularisation response which enhanced normality of the vasculature (p, 0. 05). This was associated with mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells and their localisation to the retinal vasculature. Darbepoetin alfa also {{increased the number of}} active microglia in the ischaemic retina relative to other ESAs (p, 0. 05). Darbepoetin alfa induced retinal TNFa and VEGF mRNA expression which were up to 4 fold higher than with epoetin delta (p, 0. 001). Conclusions: This study has implications for treatment of patients as there are clear differences in the angiogenic potentia...|$|E
40|$|Background. Extending the {{administration}} interval of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) represents {{an opportunity to}} improve the efficiency of anaemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, effective haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance can be challenging with epoetin alfa and <b>epoetin</b> <b>beta</b> administered at extended intervals. C. E. R. A., a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, has a unique pharmacologic profile and long half-life (∼ 130 h), allowing administration at extended intervals. Phase III results have demonstrated that C. E. R. A. administered once every 4 weeks effectively maintains stable Hb levels in patients with CKD on dialysis...|$|E
