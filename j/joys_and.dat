25|$|In 1956 Sun {{became the}} artistic {{director}} and vice-president {{of the new}} Chinese Experimental Theatre. While working with the Experimental Theatre, Sun attempted {{to create a new}} style of socialist art by combining Stanislavsky's system with dramatic techniques found in traditional Chinese opera. In June 1956 Sun produced the play <b>Joys</b> <b>and</b> Sorrows, a drama about a romantic triangle between a CCP official and two women. The play was warmly received for its verisimilitude, portraying CCP officials as prone to the same weaknesses as other people. Because <b>Joys</b> <b>and</b> Sorrows focused on the personal life of a CCP leader, both it and Sun were criticized during the Anti-Rightist Movement of 1957, initiated by Mao in order to persecute those potentially critical of him.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also {{cultivated}} the Greek folk song (Demotiko) which {{is divided into}} two cycles, the akritic and klephtic. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with Digenes Akritas. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the Greek War of Independence. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, paraloghes (narrative song or ballad), love songs, mantinades, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.|$|E

Armijn Pane, writing four years after the film's release, criticised the troops' neatness during their march, writing that their uniforms should have become progressively dirtier. Foreign reception, however, has been more positive. The Japanese film critic Tadao Sato, for instance, praised the film's concept, comparing it to the work of Andrzej Wajda.|$|E

Pink's vocal range spans from the high-tone of B♭4 to the low-tone of F3. Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press commented that although the song did not display the power of Pink vocals, [...] "her voice is still potent, full of hurt and confusion that anyone can feel".

500|$|In Arhanghelii, the {{implicit}} Christian lesson {{is about the}} love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community. At {{the heart of the}} novel is a former notary, Rodean, whose gold claim appears to be endlessly productive and corrupting. As Șăineanu writes: [...] "with emotion and mounting interest, we witness here the ephemeral <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village." [...] The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall [...] "awkward", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a [...] "frightening human torment" [...] by Iorga. Șăineanu deplores its [...] "prolixity" [...] and arcane mining terminology. As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from the card table to see his mine collapsing, [...] "has remarkable qualities of literary vividness and vigor." [...] Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a [...] "solidly realistic novel" [...] that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its [...] "originality and newness". He sees Agârbiceanu as an [...] "unlucky" [...] novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally.|$|E

In Bloomberg News, the critics commented that the playwrights were [...] "literary alchemists expert at mixing the sentimental and the satirical and turning out something poignant" [...] and noted that the clothing and accessories dominated the memories while [...] "The men are extras." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the show as a cross between The Vagina Monologues and What Not to Wear. Helen Shaw, writing for Time Out, also described the Ephrons' style as similar to The Vagina Monologuess' Eve Ensler. [...] Jay Reiner of The Hollywood Reporter also notes that from the work [...] "a tapestry of the collective female psyche emerges that is tender and insightful without being sentimental". TheaterMania.com, Inc. describes the show as [...] "So insightful and entertaining is this survey of sartorial preoccupations and the deeper questions underlying them that multiple viewings would be advisable." ...|$|E
500|$|He and Albert {{were brought}} up and educated {{together}} {{as if they were}} twins. Though Albert was fourteen months younger, he surpassed Ernest intellectually. According to their tutor, [...] "they went hand-in-hand in all things, whether at work or at play. Engaging in the same pursuits, sharing the same <b>joys</b> <b>and</b> the same sorrows, they were bound to each other by no common feelings of mutual love". Perhaps the [...] "sorrows" [...] aforementioned related to their parents' marriage. It was not a happy one and Duke Ernest I was continually unfaithful. In 1824, Ernest I and Louise divorced; she subsequently left Coburg and was disallowed from seeing her sons again. She soon remarried to Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Pölzig and Beiersdorf, dying in 1831 at the age of thirty. The year after her death, their father married his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg, who was his sister Antoinette's daughter. Their stepmother was thus also their first cousin. The duke and his new duchess were not close, and would produce no children; while the boys formed a happy relationship with their stepmother, Marie had little to no input in her stepsons' lives. The separation and divorce of their parents, as well as the later death of their mother left the boys scarred and in close companionship with each other.|$|E
