5|$|Opinion has varied on the {{validity}} of a separate genus for Nedoceratops. John Scannella and Jack Horner regarded it as an intermediate <b>growth</b> <b>stage</b> between Triceratops and Torosaurus. Andrew Farke, in his 2011 redescription of the only known skull, concluded {{that it was an}} aged individual of its own valid taxon, Nedoceratops hatcheri. Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Fields also did not consider it a transition between Torosaurus and Triceratops, suggesting that the frill holes were pathological.|$|E
25|$|Dodson {{believed}} {{one species}} of Monoclonius, M. nasicornis, {{may actually have}} been a female Styracosaurus. His assessments have been partially followed, with other researchers not accepting Monoclonius nasicornis as a female Styracosaurus, or Monoclonius as a valid genus. While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for an earlier ceratopsian, Protoceratops, there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid. Others have synonymies C. nasicornus with C. apertus, or considered it a separate Centrosaurus species: Centrosaurus nasicornus. It has also been suggested as the direct ancestor of Styracosaurus albertensis. A 2014 study of changes during growth in Centrosaurus concluded that C. nasicornus is a junior synonym of C. apertus, representing a middle <b>growth</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E

In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early <b>growth</b> <b>stage</b> when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile polystyrene rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added.

25|$|Müller {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of Darwin. He wrote Für Darwin in 1864, arguing that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was correct, and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any <b>growth</b> <b>stage.</b> Müller sent a copy to Darwin, who had the book privately translated for his own use. A later translation into English, with some additional material by Müller, was made by W.S. Dallas, and was published as Facts and Arguments for Darwin in 1869 (Darwin sponsored the translation and publication). If Müller had a weakness it was that his writing was much less readable than that of Darwin or Wallace; both the German and English editions are hard reading indeed, which has limited the appreciation of this significant book.|$|E

40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{environmental}} factors limiting crop productivity. For this reason, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in Rasht, North of Iran during 2010 growing season to evaluate the salinity levels of irrigation water at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> on the some physiological characterization of rice. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two factors and three replications. Factor one included four levels of saline water (2, 4, 6, and 8 dS m‒ 1); factor two consisted of four <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> (tillering, panicle initiation, panicle emergence and ripening). The results of this work showed that effect of different salinity levels on the all yield components except percentage of filled grains per panicle was not significant. Increase in salinity levels decreased this component. Effect of different <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> on total number of empty grains per panicles, percentage of filled grains per panicle, number of unfilled panicles and percentage of ratio of number of unfilled panicles to tillers was significant but effect of different saline water on length of unfilled panicle and number of spikelets per unfilled panicle was insignificant. Resistance of final <b>growth</b> <b>stages,</b> i. e. panicle emergence and ripening stages against salinity was more than primary <b>growth</b> <b>stages,</b> i. e. tillering and panicle initiation. Therefore, in irrigation with saline water the final <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> were important and irrigation with saline water should be applied at final <b>growth</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hydroponic {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} appraise variation in the salt tolerance potential of two wheat cultivars (salt tolerant, S- 24 and moderately salt sensitive MH- 97) at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Salinity stress caused a marked reduction in plant {{biomass and grain yield}} of both wheat cultivars. However, cv. S- 24 was superior to cv. MH- 97 in maintaining higher plant biomass and grain yield under saline stress. Furthermore, salinity caused a significant variation in different physiological attributes measured at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> For example, salt stress caused a marked reduction in net photosynthetic and transpiration rate in both wheat cultivars but to a varying extent at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Higher photosynthetic and transpiration rates were recorded at the boot stage than at other <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> in both wheat cultivars. The response of other gas exchange attributes was also variable at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Salt sensitive wheat cultivar MH- 97 was more prone to salt-induced adverse effects on gas exchange attributes as compared to cv. S- 24. Salt stress caused considerable reduction in different water relation attributes of wheat plants. A significant reduction in leaf water, osmotic and turgor potentials was recorded in both wheat cultivars at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Maximal reduction in leaf water potential was recorded at the reproductive stage in both wheat cultivars. In contrast, maximal turgor potential was observed at the boot stage. Salt-induced adverse effects of salinity on different water relation attributes were more prominent in cv. MH- 97 as compared to those in cv. S- 24. The integrity of PS II was greatly perturbed in both wheat cultivars at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> and this salt-induced damage to PS II was more in cv. MH- 97. A significant alteration in different biochemical attributes was also observed in both wheat cultivars at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> For example, salt stress caused a substantial decrease in chlorophyll pigments, ascorbic acid, phenolics and tocopherols. In contrast, it increased the endogenous levels of ROS (H 2 O 2), MDA, total soluble proteins, proline, glycine betaine and activities of enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, POD, CAT, APX). These biochemical attributes exhibited significant salt-induced variation at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> in both wheat cultivars. For example, maximum accumulation of glycine betaine and proline was recorded at the early <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> (vegetative and boot). However, cv. S- 24 showed higher accumulation of these two organic osmolytes and this could be the reason for maintenance of higher turgor than that of cv. MH- 97 under stress conditions. The activities of various enzymatic antioxidants increased markedly in both wheat cultivars, particularly at the vegetative stage. However, cv. S- 24 exhibited consistent increase in the activities of various enzymatic antioxidants, whereas, this phenomena occurred erratically in cv. MH- 97 at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Salt stress significantly increased the endogenous levels of toxic ions (Na+and Cl-) and decreased essential cations (K+ and Ca 2 +) in both wheat cultivars at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages.</b> Furthermore, K+/Na+ and Ca 2 +/Na+ ratios decreased markedly due to salt stress in both wheat cultivars at different <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> and this salt-induced reduction was more prominent in cv. MH- 97. Moreover, higher K+/Na+ and Ca 2 +/Na+ ratios were recorded at early <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> in both wheat cultivars. It can be inferred from the results that wheat plants are more prone to adverse effects of salinity stress at early <b>growth</b> <b>stages</b> than that at the reproductive stage...|$|R
