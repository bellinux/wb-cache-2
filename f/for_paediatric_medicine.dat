40|$|We {{sought to}} {{understand}} gaps in reporting childhood TB cases among {{public and private}} sector health facilities (dubbed "non-NTP" facilities) outside the network of national TB control programmes, and the resulting impact of under-reporting on estimates of paediatric disease burden and market demand for new medicines. Exploratory assessments were carried out in Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan, reaching a range of facility types in two selected areas of each country. Record reviews and interviews of healthcare providers were carried out to assess numbers of unreported paediatric TB cases, diagnostic pathways followed and treatment regimens prescribed. A total of 985 unreported diagnosed paediatric TB cases were identified over a three month period in 2013 in Indonesia from 64 facilities, 463 in Pakistan from 35 facilities and 24 in Nigeria from 20 facilities. These represent an absolute additional annualised yield to 2013 notifications reported to WHO of 15 % for Indonesia, 2 % for Nigeria and 7 % for Pakistan. Only 12 % of all facilities provided age and sex-disaggregated data. Findings highlight the challenges of confirming childhood TB. Diagnosis patterns in Nigeria highlight a very low suspicion for childhood TB. Providers note the need <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> aligned to WHO recommendations. This study emphasises the impact of incomplete reporting on the estimation of disease burden and potential market size of <b>paediatric</b> TB <b>medicines.</b> Further studies on "hubs" (facilities treating large numbers of childhood TB cases) will improve {{our understanding of the}} epidemic, support introduction efforts for new treatments and better measure markets <b>for</b> new <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Concern with {{potential}} toxicity {{due to the}} widespread use of unlicensed and off label drugs in children has led to regulatory changes aimed to strengthen the evidence base <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> drugs. This thesis examines paediatric randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the highest level of evidence, and assesses them in relation to global child health. 	 A systematic review was performed using validated methods to search three major databases <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> RCTs published in 2007. More than 600 RCTs were identified involving more than 100, 000 children. The RCTs appear to study the appropriate clinical areas however few studies involved neonates. The RCTs also seem to be of good methodological quality with a mean Jadad score of 3. 22. The reporting of RCTs that involve both adults and children needs to be improved to add to the evidence base of <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b> More attention is also needed on the reporting of safety information from the RCTs to provide useful toxicity data. Although severe and moderate ADRs were seen in 25 % of the RCTs, few RCTs (12 %) established safety monitoring committees (SMCs). SMCs are vital to ensure patients in paediatric RCTs are protected from toxicity. The burden of childhood disease is heaviest in low and middle income countries (LMIC). A minority of the RCTs were performed in LMIC, although they are increasingly globalised. RCTs conducted in LMIC appear to have lower methodological quality, and reported less well on ethical approval and adverse events. In conclusion high quality, ethical paediatric RCTs should add to the evidence base <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b> However they should correspond with the health needs of children on a global basis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{availability}} of appropriate medicines for children is an extensive and well known problem. Paediatricians and Physicians who {{take care of}} the paediatric population are primarily exposed to cope with this negative situation very often as {{more than half of the}} children are prescribed off-label or unlicensed medicines. Discussion Medicinal products used to treat this population should be subjected to ethical research of high quality and be explicitly authorised for use in children as it happens in adults. For that reason, and following the US experience, the European Paediatric Regulation has been amended in January 2007 by the European Commission. The objective of the Paediatric Regulation is to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children aged 0 to 17 years, to facilitate the {{availability of}} information on the use of medicines for children, without subjecting children to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorisation of medicines for use in adults. Summary The Paediatric Regulation is dramatically changing the regulatory environment <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> in Europe and is fuelling an increased number of clinical trials in the paediatric population. Nevertheless, there are some risks and pitfalls that need to be anticipated and controlled in order to ensure that children will ultimately benefit from this European initiative. </p...|$|R
40|$|This European Respiratory Society {{task force}} has {{reviewed}} the evidence <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> in respiratory disease occurring in adults and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies. Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies {{will focus on}} screened infants and robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection, antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance. In uncommon conditions, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, congenital pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, drugs indicated for other conditions (e. g. dornase alfa) are commonly used and trials are needed. In neuromuscular disorders, the beta-agonists may enhance muscle strength and {{are in need of}} evaluation. Studies of antibiotic prophylaxis, immunoglobulin and antifungal drugs are needed in immune deficiency. We hope that this summary of the evidence for respiratory medicines in children, highlighting gaps and research priorities, will be useful for the pharmaceutical industry, the paediatric committee of the European Medicines Agency, academic investigators and the lay publi...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Patient acceptability of a medicinal product {{is a key}} aspect {{in the development and}} prescribing of medi-cines. Children and older adults differ in many aspects from the other age subsets of population and require par-ticular considerations in medication acceptability. This review highlights the similarities and differences in these two age groups in relation to factors affecting acceptability of medicines. New and conventional formulations of medicines are considered regarding their appropriateness for use in children and older people. Aspects of a formu-lation that impact acceptability in these patient groups are discussed, including, for example, taste/smell/viscosity of a liquid and size/shape of a tablet. A better understanding of the acceptability of existing formulations highlights opportunities for the development of new and more acceptable medicines and facilitates safe and effective prescribing for the young and older populations. Key Points Appropriate pharmaceutical design of oral medicines can improve acceptability and patient outcomes in paediatric and geriatric populations. Similar considerations should be given to physical characteristics affecting swallowability of tablets and capsules for use in children and older patients. Whilst formulation factors such as taste and smell are important features <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines,</b> safe swallowing is the key formulation factor in designing medicines for older patients. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prescribing}} of unlicensed and {{off label}} medicines to children {{has become an}} area of concern due to risks of toxicity and side effects or suboptimal therapy.   Current efforts to reduce this practice have so far concentrated on encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to conduct paediatric clinical trails where appropriate {{to increase the number}} of <b>medicines</b> licensed <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> use in the future.   This work investigated off label prescribing, homeopathic prescribing and the co-prescribing of corticosteroid preparations in primary care in order to highlight other target areas <b>for</b> improving <b>paediatric</b> prescribing. Results: At least 1 off label prescription was issued to 17715 (26. 1 %) children.   Prescribing outside the recommended dose was the most common from of off label prescribing with prescribing trends and GP responses to the questionnaire indicating that this may be inadvertent due to the wide variation in dose related age bandings <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b>   Homeopathic medicines were most commonly prescribed to infants (1. 1 %) with self-limiting conditions.   GPs with a favourable opinion were found to influence the opinions of their partners. The co-prescribing of inhaled and nasal corticosteroids was common particularly in adolescents with the majority receiving a high total steroid burden. Conclusions: Off label prescribing in primary care could be reduced by standardising dose related age bandings for medicines based on major childhood physiological and developmental stages. Increased training in homeopathy and the presence of an interested partner may facilitate communication and ensure children receive optimal therapy. For children chronically prescribed more than one corticosteroid preparation consideration should be given to the total daily steroid burden to minimise potential adverse effects on growth and development.

40|$|It is rare <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> palliative <b>medicine</b> {{physicians}} {{to have to}} break news of a diagnosis of a life-limiting condition (LLC). Usually {{that has been done}} weeks or months before. It is much commoner for us to be faced with the question: "how long?" Clearly it is a question that cannot be answered with certainty, and yet a great deal may depend on it. While palliative care (PC) should ideally be available from diagnosis, the need for 'active' practical PC intervention will fluctuate {{during the course of a}} child's illness. For most children this will last months or years; often decades. Typically, there will be several periods during which death seems likely before the final terminal episode, particularly among children with non-malignant LLC. Optimal management of all these episodes depends on anticipating the child’s needs in order for timely interventions - or withdrawal of interventions - to be considered. This consideration in turn depends on recognising that such an episode has begun. Providing adequate PC critically depends on making a diagnosis of dying. In this article, we will consider why it is important to make a 'diagnosis of dying', briefly review some of the tools available to help, and examine some of the evidence from published literature in children and adults...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{diseases}} remain {{among the}} {{leading causes of}} morbidity and mortality in children. Yet <b>paediatric</b> respiratory <b>medicine</b> (PRM) is a young subspecialty which only started to develop in the 1940 s. Many of the early leaders were physiologists and clinicians with a special interest in the breathing of chil-dren, who applied physiological techniques to study lung function in children [1]. With scientific advances, and thus the increasing difficulties of mastering the whole discipline of children's medicine, the need for subspecialisation has become imperative. The subspecialty of PRM {{has come a long way}} and in Europe, PRM continues to evolve towards a consolidated and recognised tertiary care sub-specialty. Structured programmes for education and training in PRM are now central to the development of the subspecialty and to a longer-term goal of ensuring the best quality of care for all children with respiratory problems. Harmonising education and training at the European level will have a major role in achiev-ing this goal and is thus a priority for all involved in clinical care of children with respi-ratory diseases. Working towards this more than 10 years ago, the Long Range Planning Committee of the Paediatric Assembly of the European Respiratory Society (ERS), led by Max Zach, developed the first Training Syllabus <b>for</b> <b>Paediatric</b> Respiratory <b>Medicine</b> as a tertiary care subspecialty. This pioneering syllabus specified both the content of training and cur-riculum components and has since served as a model for other specialties. However, this first syllabus was developed by a few distinguished European specialists in PRM, and at that stage, there were only limited opportunities for wider consultation. Following the example of the ER...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The 1995 - 2005 {{balance of}} EMEA {{activities}} {{in the field of}} <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> was evaluated, taking into account the number both of drugs authorised <b>for</b> children and <b>paediatric</b> studies supporting the Marketing Authorisation (MA). Methods: Data on drugs authorised by EMEA were extracted from EPARs (European Public Assessment Reports). Active substance, year of approval, anatomical, therapeutic and chemical (ATC) code, indication, orphan status, ages, and registrative clinical studies characteristics were assessed. Results: The percentage of authorised substances for paediatrics is 33. 3 %. This percentage decreased or increased when different subsets of medicines were considered [medicines for children under 2 years (23. 4 %), N-ATC code drugs (6 %) and orphan drugs (46. 4 %) ]. A total of 165 trials were included in the MA dossiers of 51 drugs at the time of approval, and additional 22 studies were added to the dossiers of 12 active substances submitted <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> variations. PK and Efficacy/Safety studies were performed for 32 (52 %) active substances, while either one PK or one Efficacy/Safety study was carried out for 43 (69 %) and 45 (73 %) substances, respectively.

40|$|AbstractSeven {{years after}} {{the launch of the}} European <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Medicine</b> Regulation, limited {{progress}} in paediatric oncology drug development remains a major concern amongst stakeholders – academics, industry, regulatory authorities, parents, patients and caregivers. Restricted increases in early phase paediatric oncology trials, legal requirements and regulatory pressure to propose early Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs), missed opportunities to explore new drugs potentially relevant <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> malignancies, lack of innovative trial designs and no new incentives to develop drugs against specific paediatric targets are some unmet needs. Better access to new anti-cancer drugs <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> clinical studies and improved collaboration between stakeholders are essential. The Cancer Drug Development Forum (CDDF), previously Biotherapy Development Association (BDA), with Innovative Therapy for Children with Cancer Consortium (ITCC), European Society <b>for</b> <b>Paediatric</b> Oncology (SIOPE) and European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA) has created a unique Paediatric Oncology Platform, involving multiple stakeholders and the European Union (EU) Commission, with an urgent remit to improve paediatric oncology drug development. The Paediatric Oncology Platform proposes to recommend immediate changes in the implementation of the Regulation and set the framework for its 2017 revision; initiatives to incentivise drug development against specific paediatric oncology targets, and repositioning of drugs not developed in adults. Underpinning these changes is a strategy for mechanism of action and biology driven selection and prioritisation of potential paediatric indications rather than the current process based on adult cancer indications. Pre-competitive research and drug prioritisation, early portfolio evaluation, cross-industry cooperation and multi-compound/sponsor trials are being explored, from which guidance for innovative trial designs will be provided...|$|R

It {{consists of a}} network of 43 centres from England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and aims to improve the emergency care of children through the performance of robust collaborative multicentre research within emergency departments. A study was conducted regarding the research priorities of PERUKI, to establish the research agenda <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> emergency <b>medicine</b> in the UK and Ireland. Methods A two-stage modified Delphi survey was conducted of PERUKI members via an online survey platform. Stage 1 allowed each member to submit up to 12 individual questions that they identified as priorities for future research. In stage 2, the shortlisted questions were each rated on a seven-point Likert scale of relative importance. Participants Members of PERUKI, including clinical specialists, academics, trainees and research nurses. Results Stage 1 surveys were submitted by 46 / 91 PERUKI members (51 %). A total of 249 research questions were generated and, following the removal of duplicate questions and shortlisting, 60 questions were carried forward for stage 2 ranking. Stage 2 survey responses were submitted by 58 / 95 members (61 %). For the 60 research questions that were rated, the mean score of ‘relative degree of importance’ was 4. 70 (range 3. 36 – 5. 62, SD 0. 55). After ranking, the top 10 research priorities included questions on biomarkers for serious bacterial illness, major trauma, intravenous bronchodilators for asthma and decision rules for fever with petechiae, head injury and atraumatic limp.

40|$|The new {{paediatric}} European Union (EU) {{regulation and}} the consequent demand <b>for</b> <b>paediatric</b> studies {{on one hand and}} the ethical need for minimizing the burden of studies in children on the other hand necessitate optimal techniques in the assessment of safety/efficacy and use of drugs in children. Modelling and simulation (M&S) is one way to circumvent some difficulties in developing medicinal products in children. M&S allows the quantitative use of sparse sampling, characterization and prediction of pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), extrapolation from adults to children, interpolation between paediatric age subsets, optimal use of scientific literature and in vitro/preclinical data. Together, industry, academia and regulators recognize the usefulness of modelling and simulation in this setting.
