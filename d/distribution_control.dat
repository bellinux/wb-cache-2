Such industrial grade resistors can be {{as large as a}} refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, with a range of resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms.

The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the street Viper, but {{increased}} power to , and [...] of torque. The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an FIA-legal roll cage. [...] The exterior design of the Competition Coupe {{was based on the}} Viper GTS-R concept from 1999. [...] Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper were a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing control arm attachments, two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. [...] The anti-lock braking system added a <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> system. The initial price of the car is around $100,000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located {{inside and outside the}} core. The physical power density <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in {{the central part of the}} core. [...] There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the reactor}} control rods are {{inserted}} from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below {{and are used}} to augment the axial power <b>distribution</b> <b>control</b> of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a [...] long graphite section at the end, separated by a [...] long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a boron carbide neutron absorber section. The role of the graphite section, known as [...] "displacer," [...] is to enhance {{the difference between the}} neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a neutron absorber, although much weaker than boron carbide; a control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased. When the control rod is fully retracted, the graphite displacer is located {{in the middle of the}} core height, with 1.25m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25m of the core as the rod moves down causes a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This [...] "positive scram" [...] effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent water circuit and kept at [...] The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18–21 seconds for the RCPS rods, or about 0.4m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod tubes by a thin layer of water while letting the rods themselves move in gas.|$|E
