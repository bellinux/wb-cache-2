6000|$|... "I was not," [...] she said. [...] "I {{knew you}} were on board a ship that had just arrived. Then I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> to Mr. Jefferson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I did {{not keep}} you waiting," [...] I said, [...] "but I stayed at the door as I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking,</b> and thought there was someone with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} mean enough," [...] she answered, [...] "to listen at the door, and I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> of your father. I {{want to hear}} more about him. That is why I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Compromise? Robert, why do <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> so {{differently}} to-night {{from the}} way I have always <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk?</b> Why are <b>you</b> changed? ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Looking {{at him in}} surprise.] Lord Goring, <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> quite seriously. I don’t think I ever <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> seriously before.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, doctor, but I've <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about Browning's poetry: {{and that}} {{showed me that}} you're METAPHYSICAL, at any rate. So--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl's {{sense of}} humor triumphed for a second over her excitement. [...] "There are your diamonds," [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about them at dinner the other night. One of them you said was worth a hundred pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|ISABEL. Please, {{there as}} {{something}} I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about, last time, with Miss Mary. I {{was at my}} lessons, but I heard something about nests; and I thought it was birds' nests; and I couldn't help listening; and then, I remember, it was about [...] "nests of quartz in granite." [...] I remember, because I was so disappointed! ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was gone}} rather long {{and there was}} talk within and the cooing and babble of the child. When she {{came out with a}} basin of warm water and some lard in a broken saucer in her hands, and a towel caught under her arm, he suggested, [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> with some one, Nancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Betty, what in {{the world}} do you mean? I never <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> that way," [...] said Lydia, opening her blue eyes in astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of {{something}} in the spy way upon the others, my dear,' said Fagin. 'My friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{called at}} the Rue de St. Antoine," [...] he answered. [...] "The {{housekeeper}} {{said that she}} had <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about dining at one of these places. Arnold?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] he answered, [...] "I've {{starved for}} three days and nights in {{a hole in the ground}} like an earthed-up fox; a culvert in your garden hid me. At last I crept out to see the light and die, and <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking,</b> and thought that I would ask for mercy, since mortal {{extremity}} has no honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was glad}} when I heard your voices, señors," [...] Maria {{said when she}} {{appeared}} {{a quarter of an}} hour later. [...] "I knew they would not hurt me; but I was horribly frightened, and wrapped myself up in my blanket and lay there till I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking,</b> and I heard the logs thrown on the fire; then I felt that it was all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'DEAR CHARLES,--Living here so {{long and}} intimately with Helena, I have [...] {{naturally}} learnt her history, especially that of it which refers to [...] you. I am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time, [...] and I {{think you ought to}} give her the opportunity. You inquire in an [...] old note if I am sorry that I showed temper (which it wasn't) that [...] night when I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> to her. No, Charles, I am not sorry at [...] all for what I said then.--Yours sincerely, SALLY HALL.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Philip. If 'it' <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> like that, <b>you</b> {{would join}} Grumps. Don't {{let me hear}} any more such stuff," [...] but, though she spoke sharply, somehow {{she did not look}} displeased.|$|R
6000|$|LUCRETIA: Look not so dreadfully! By my {{salvation}} I {{knew not}} aught that Beatrice designed; Nor do I think she designed any thing [...] 160 Until she <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of her dead brothers.|$|R
6000|$|Sar. My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music: [...] The very {{chorus of}} the tragic song [...] I have <b>heard</b> <b>thee</b> <b>talk</b> of as the {{favourite}} pastime [...] Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, like Juliet Bingham. It {{was your}} voice made me think--it was your voice that first {{made me want}} to see you, that made me write to you, in the beginning. I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> that night in the hotel, where you left that circular; you were in the room next to mine; and I wanted to come right up here then; but I {{had to go back to}} New York, and so I wrote to you. When your letters came, I always seemed to hear you {{speaking}} in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, they weren't," [...] she {{answered}} {{without the slightest}} hesitation. [...] "One real dance, when at last it came, was worth the whole of them. Oh, I know, I've <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking,</b> all of you--of the faces {{that you see in}} dreams and that are ever so much more beautiful than the faces that you see when you're awake; of the wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints, {{and all the rest of}} it. I don't believe a word of it. It's tommyrot!" ...|$|E
60|$|After privately {{slipping}} the laudanum {{into your}} brandy and water, he wished you good night, {{and went into}} his own room. It was the next room to yours; and the two had a door of communication between them. On entering his own room Mr. Godfrey (as he supposed) closed his door. His money troubles kept him awake. He sat, in his dressing-gown and slippers, for nearly an hour, thinking over his position. Just as he was preparing to get into bed, he <b>heard</b> <b>you,</b> <b>talking</b> to yourself, in your own room, {{and going to the}} door of communication, found that he had not shut it as he supposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, George! George! you frighten me! Why, I never <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> so; I'm afraid you'll do {{something}} dreadful. I don't wonder at your feelings, at all; but oh, do be careful--do, do--for my sake--for Harry's!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please! Don't be angry! I just mean--I mean----Oh, {{not spend}} all of it, of course, {{but if you}} led off the list, and the others came in, and if they <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about a more {{attractive}} town----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, dear, don't go too {{far into}} things. Lie down again. You have been dreaming. What are the Madicojumbras and Zuzitotzums? I never <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of them before. What use can it be troubling {{yourself}} about such things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Making up your bill? We'll square it at {{the fifteen}} dollars to the day you hauled in the last load. Now I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> of taking up land, and I've been {{thinking}} some. Nothing to earn a dollar at before the spring, and it will cost you considerable to board at Regina or Brandon. Is there anything the matter with stopping here? If you are particular we'll make it a deal and cut in three the grocery bill. Meantime you can chop building lumber ready to start your house in spring. No, it isn't any favor; I'll be mighty glad of your company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there, Miss," [...] Jane ran on, {{putting a}} cushion to my back tenderly--it was strange {{to be the}} {{recipient}} of so much delicate attention from a perfect stranger,--"not exactly what you'd call harsh to us ourselves, you know: {{he was a good}} master enough, as long as one did what was ordered, though he was a little bit fidgetty. But to you, we all thought he was always rather hard. People said so in Woodbury. And yet, in a way, I don't know how it was, he always seemed more'n half afraid of you. He was careful about your health, and spoiled and petted you for that; yet he was always pulling you up, you know, and looking after what you did: and for one thing, I remember, there's many a time you were sent to bed when you were a good big girl for nothing on earth else but because he <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> to us in the hall about Australia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} it is every young fellow's lot," [...] quoth George, as we trudged home together, [...] "to pawn his heart away to some girl that's not worth the winning? Psha! it's all mad rubbish this sentiment. The women {{ought not to be}} allowed to {{interfere}} with us: married if a man must be, a suitable wife should be portioned out to him, and there an end of it. Why doesn't the young man marry this girl, and get back to his business and paint his pictures? Because his father wishes it--and the old Nabob yonder, who seems a kindly-disposed, easy-going, old heathen philosopher. Here's a pretty little girl: money I suppose in sufficiency--everything satisfactory, except, I grant you, the campaigner. The lad might daub his canvases, christen a child a year, and be as happy as any young donkey that browses on this common of ours--but he must go and heehaw after a zebra forsooth! a lusus naturae is she! I never spoke to a woman of fashion, thank my stars--I don't know the nature of the beast; and since I went to our race-balls, as a boy, scarcely ever saw one; as I don't frequent operas and parties in London like you young flunkeys of the aristocracy. I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about this one; I couldn't help it, as my door was open and the young one was shouting like a madman. What! does he choose to hang on on sufferance and hope to be taken, provided Miss can get no better? Do you mean to say that is the genteel custom, and that women in your confounded society do such things every day? Rather than have such a creature I would take a savage woman, who should nurse my dusky brood; and rather than have a daughter brought up to the trade I would bring her down from the woods and sell her in Virginia." [...] With which burst of indignation our friend's anger ended for that night.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You vowed you did {{not believe}} the scandals about me, and now, when I refuse you the {{smallest}} thing, you are ready to believe every word. What a love is this! I thought I had <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> so often of boundless confidence.' ...|$|R
60|$|MAUD. No; you've {{got to hear}} things. You don't {{really love}} anybody but yourself, father. What's good for you has {{to be good for}} everybody. I've often <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about independence, but it's a limited company and you've got all the shares.|$|R
6000|$|It was the Progenitor's {{turn now}} to start in surprise. 'What! Lady Hilda!' he cried with a bewildered look. 'Lady Hilda! Did I hear you say [...] "Lady Hilda"? Is this Lady Hilda Tregellis, then, that I've <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about so often, Artie?' ...|$|R
50|$|Trafalgar: The Biography of a Battle made an {{appearance}} at Christmas in the comedy programme 'Peep Show' (series 7 episode 5), when Mark (played by David Mitchell) receives {{a copy of}} the book as a present from his flatmate Jeremy (played by Robert Webb). 'I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about it', comments Jeremy, to which Mark replies 'That's just tremendously thoughtful Jeremy'.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{a sudden}} change in Sir Syed's views after the Hindi-Urdu controversy: his {{education}} and reformist policies became Muslim-specific and he fought for the status of Urdu. His biographer, Hali, wrote, [...] "One day as Sir Syed was discussing educational affairs of Muslims with Mr. Shakespeare - the then Commissioner of Banaras - Mr. Shakespeare looked surprised and asked him, [...] "This {{is the first time}} when I have <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> specifically about Muslims. Before this you used to talk about the welfare of the common Indians. Sir Syed then told him, [...] "Now I am convinced that the two communities Muslims and Hindus will not put their hearts in any venture together. This is nothing it is just the beginning, in the coming times an ever increasing hatred and animosity appears on the horizon simply because of those who are regarded as educated. Those who will be around will witness it.", (Hali, 1993). Overall Sir Syed is hailed as the father of the Two Nation Theory and one of the founding fathers of Pakistan, along with Allama Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mother, how <b>you</b> <b>talk!</b> Do <b>you</b> {{know what}} St. Peter {{would say to}} <b>you</b> if he <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about lying? He'd up and jam his halo down over his ears and he'd say, 'You can't come in here, Sarah Jane Appleby. You're a liar. And {{you know what you}} can do, don't you? You can go--'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} never since been to that place you struck the day the Utes came down, Harry?" [...] Jerry asked. [...] "I have <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> of a place you knew of, just {{at the edge of}} the bad lands, off the Utah hills. Were that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My good Piero," [...] said Romola, {{looking up}} and smiling at the grim man, [...] "even you must be glad {{to see some of}} these things burnt. Look at those gewgaws and wigs and rouge-pots: I have <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> as indignantly against those things as Fra Girolamo himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{was just}} as far as I could walk [...] From here to-day, [...] There was an hour [...] All still [...] When leaning with my head against a flower [...] I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk.</b> [...] Don't say I didn't, for I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> say-- [...] You spoke from that flower on the window sill-- [...] Do you {{remember}} what it was you said?" ...|$|R
