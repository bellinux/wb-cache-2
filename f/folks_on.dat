500|$|Although Chabon has {{described}} his attitude toward Hollywood as [...] "pre-emptive cynicism," [...] {{for years the}} author has nevertheless engaged in sustained, and often fruitless, efforts to bring both adapted and original projects to the screen. In 1994, Chabon pitched a screenplay entitled The Gentleman Host to producer Scott Rudin, a romantic comedy [...] "about old Jewish <b>folks</b> <b>on</b> a third-rate cruise ship out of Miami." [...] Rudin bought the project and developed it with Chabon, {{but it was never}} filmed, partly due to the release of the similarly themed film Out to Sea in 1997. In the nineties, Chabon also pitched story ideas for both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four movies, but was rejected.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} it as a [...] "motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal." [...] MTV News' James Montogomery called the video as a pure pop clip, [...] "albeit one that looks great and is sure to earn the ire of a few <b>folks</b> <b>on</b> the religious right." [...] He added that [...] "Judas" [...] is, at its sacred heart, an artistic explosion contained within the confines of a traditional pop clip. Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly did not like the video at first, calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to Gibson's choreography and the literal storyline. However, he admitted that after watching the video a few times, he became fond of it. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about the video, nor anything too daring about it. McCall explained that the dancing in the video is a [...] "pleasure to watch", but would have been better if the camera work was more professional. According to him, the only eye-catching prop in the video was the gun that turned into a lipstick. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone was certain that the video would offend some Christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on Jesus Christ; he also said that Gaga interpreted the Biblical story in her own style. Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary. It takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-chain aesthetic of [...] "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of [...] "Bad Romance") and puts them all together for a competently executed work." [...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually." [...] He then went on to explain how the religion related accusations against Gaga were completely biased. VH1 found that the video was inspired by Madonna's [...] "Like a Prayer", the films Our Lady of the Assassins, The Wild Angels and Romeo + Juliet, and the American television series Lost. NME named 'Judas' the fourth worst music video ever, describing it as [...] "an attempt to jump on the Madonna/Catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it's quite comical." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Metacritic, Robyn was {{the tenth}} best-reviewed album of 2008, {{as well as}} the best-reviewed pop album of the 2000–09 decade. Slant Magazine listed it as the second best album of 2008. Entertainment Weekly ranked it at number four on its list of the 10 Best CDs of 2008, praising Robyn as [...] "an autonomous, thrillingly {{eccentric}} dance diva capable of both wrenching techno ballads [...] and saucy, whip-smart kiss-offs". Pitchfork, on its list of the Top 50 Albums of 2005, placed the album at number thirty-nine on its list and hailed Robyn as [...] "one of the best things that happened to music this year that <b>folks</b> <b>on</b> {{the wrong side of the}} Atlantic never heard". Pitchfork also included it at number sixty-eight on its list of The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s and stated that [...] "obody [...] made a more lovable pop album this decade than Robyn", describing it as [...] "an indie-as-fuck fairytale: Freed from proto-Mouseketeer teen-pop servitude and inspired by the Knife, Robyn experiments across genres, emotes from the heart, and gradually amasses a netroots fanbase." [...] Aside from critics' lists, the album received a nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards, but lost out to Daft Punk's Alive 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, on 1 March, {{five people}} who were {{picketing}} next to the Federation Council building against the invasion of Ukraine were arrested. The next day about 200 people protested at {{the building of the}} Russian Ministry of Defence in Moscow against Russian military involvement. About 500 people also gathered to protest on the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow and the same number of people on the Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg. On 2 March, about eleven protesters demonstrated in Yekaterinburg against Russian involvement, with some wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. Protests were also held in Chelyabinsk on the same day. The opposition to the military intervention was also expressed by rock musician Andrey Makarevich, who wrote in particular: [...] "You want war with Ukraine? It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the <b>folks</b> <b>on</b> the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for – for their country, their independence. [...] We have to live with them. Still neighborly. And preferably in friendship. But it's up to them how they want to live". The Professor of the Department of Philosophy at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Andrey Zubov was fired for his article in Vedomosti, criticising Russian military intervention.|$|E
