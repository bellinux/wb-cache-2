Some years ago, Yablo [1985; 1993] challenged this diagnosis, by producing a paradox that 2 ̆ 7 s liar-like but {{does not seem to}} involve circularity. But is Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> really non-circular?

40|$|To {{borrow a}} {{colorful}} phrase from Kant, this dissertation offers a prolegomenon to any future semantic theory. The dissertation investigates Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> omega-liar <b>paradox</b> and draws the following consequence. Any semantic theory that accepts {{the existence of}} semantic objects must face Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox.</b> The dissertation endeavors to position Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s omega-liar in a role analogous to that which Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> has for the foundations of mathematics. Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> showed that if we wed mathematics to sets, then because of the many different possible restrictions available for blocking the paradox, mathematics fractionates. There would be different mathematics. This is intolerable. It is similarly intolerable to have restrictions on the `objects 2 ̆ 7 of Intentionality. Hence, {{in the light of}} Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s omega-liar, Intentionality cannot be wed to any theory of semantic objects. We ought, therefore, to think of Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> as a natural language paradox, and as such we must accept its implications for the semantics of natural language, namely that those entities which are `meanings 2 ̆ 7 (natural or otherwise) must not be construed as objects. To establish our result, Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> is examined in light of the criticisms of Priest (and his followers). Priest maintains that Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s original omega-liar is flawed in its employment of a Tarski-style T-schema for its truth-predicate. Priest argues that the paradox is not formulable unless it employs a 2 ̆ 2 satisfaction 2 ̆ 2 predicate in place of its truth-predicate. Priest is mistaken. However, it will be shown that the omega-liar paradox depends essentially on the assumption of semantic objects. No formulation of the paradox is possible without this assumption. Given this, the dissertation looks at three different sorts of theories of propositions, and argues that two fail to specify a complete syntax for the Yablo sentences. Purely intensional propositions, however, are able to complete the syntax and thus generate the paradox. In the end, however, the restrictions normally associated with purely intensional propositions begin to look surprisingly like the hierarchies that Yablo sought to avoid with his paradox. The result is that while Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> is syntactically formable within systems with formal hierarchies, it is not semantically so...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis affects {{not only}} humans but almost all {{metazoan}} species. Understanding the rules driving {{the occurrence of}} cancers in the wild is currently expected to provide crucial insights into identifying how some species may have evolved efficient cancer resistance mechanisms. Recently the absence of correlation across species between cancer prevalence and body size (coined as Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox)</b> has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed, the disparity between this null hypothesis, where every cell is assumed to have an identical probability to undergo malignant transformation, and empirical observations is particularly important to understand, {{due to the fact}} that it could facilitate the identification of animal species that are more resistant to carcinogenesis than expected. Moreover it would open up ways to identify the selective pressures that may be involved in cancer resistance. However, Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> relies on several questionable assumptions, complicating the interpretation of the divergence between expected and observed cancer incidences. DISCUSSIONS: Here we review and challenge the different hypotheses on which this paradox relies on with the aim of identifying how this null hypothesis could be better estimated in order to provide a standard protocol to study the deviation between theoretical/theoretically predicted and observed cancer incidence. We show that due to the disproportion and restricted nature of available data on animal cancers, applying Peto 2 ̆ 7 s hypotheses at species level could result in erroneous conclusions, and actually assume the existence of a paradox. Instead of using species level comparisons, we propose an organ level approach to be a more accurate test of Peto 2 ̆ 7 s assumptions. SUMMARY: The accuracy of Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> assumptions are rarely valid and/or quantifiable, suggesting the need to reconsider the use of Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> as a null hypothesis in identifying the influence of natural selection on cancer resistance mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|No Iluminismo Francês, o teatro era um dos principais temas discutidos entre seus pensadores os chamados philosophes, que expressavam de forma acirrada suas ideias sobre o fenômeno da representação teatral e sua possível eficácia pedagógica, bem como acerca de suas implicações sociais e políticas na França do século XVIII. Jean-Jacques Rousseau dramaturgo, músico, poeta, romancista, enfim: um philosophe encontrava, na sua visão sobre o teatro, a metáfora do dilaceramento humano, que se deu na passagem do homem do estado de natureza para aquele da vida em sociedade. O conflito entre o ser e o parecer, tanto quanto o duelo travado entre o amor-de-si, presente no homem natural, e o amor-próprio, que artificializa o homem social, são questões fundamentais para a compreensão do philosophe genebrino. Ainda que este tema percorra toda a sua obra, é na Lettre à <b>d</b> <b>Alembert</b> sur les {{spectacles}} que Rousseau se dedica exclusivamente a realizar sua crítica a respeito dos espetáculos. Além disso, o texto traz também uma definição sobre o talento e o ofício do comédien que é igualmente válida para o acteur, isto é, o artista da cena de modo geral, seja ele um cantor da Ópera Royal de Paris ou um ator trágico da Comédie Française. Assim, esta pesquisa optou pela adoção do termo ator, na medida em que ele proporciona a vantagem de atualizar para os nossos dias tanto o comédien quanto o acteur do contexto francês da época. Publicada em 1758, a Lettre constituía resposta a <b>d</b> <b>Alembert,</b> que, em seu verbete Genève, da Encyclopédie, fazia uma defesa do teatro e de seus atores, então vistos como socialmente inferiores e desprovidos de direitos políticos e religiosos. Por esta razão, o filósofo propunha a montagem de uma companhia de teatro em Genebra, de modo a auxiliar na educação do gosto dos cidadãos genebrinos, ideia que será recusada forte e radicalmente por Rousseau. Na Lettre, é abordada de forma direta a relação entre os espetáculos, a representação do ator e a corrupção do homem na sociedade, na qual torna a se fazer presente o conflito supracitado entre o ser e o parecer. Tal oposição é focalizada no âmbito dos espetáculos parisienses, concebidos como sinais de uma sociedade afeita a aparências e futilidades que tornavam o homem cada vez mais artificial e, portanto, distanciado de sua essência e das virtudes necessárias para a formação do digno cidadão. 5 A obra oferece ainda uma sintética definição acerca do talento do comediante e sua arte de imitar, isto é, de adotar um caráter diferente daquele que se tem. Assim, o ofício do ator constitui a simulação, a clara expressão do conflito entre o ser e o parecer, uma vez que vive de sua capacidade de enganar, de seduzir a platéia, parecendo ser o que não é, se dando como espetáculo em troca de dinheiro. Rousseau, portanto, critica os hábitos luxuosos e a moral do ator, principalmente porque este pode servir-se daqueles artifícios para corromper a juventude. Para o autor da Lettre, o intérprete, em razão de sua capacidade de trocar de personagens no jogo cênico, torna-se uma metáfora da condição paradoxal do homem, que se distanciou da natureza e criou o espetáculo da cultura. A paixão que Rousseau tinha pelo teatro não o impediu de criticá-lo de modo tão implacável, pois nele enxergava não apenas um tipo específico de representação artística, como também a representação da condição do dilaceramento humano. Fazia-se necessário, pois, um novo teatro, com novos atores capazes e verdadeiros no seu ofício de mentir. Eis a crítica da representação que percorreu a Lettre à <b>d</b> <b>Alembert</b> e que fez do teatro um paradigma essencial do pensamento de seu autor. Há de se notar, por fim, que o ofício do ator pode ganhar eficácia cênica a partir da crítica processada por Rousseau naquela obra. As festas que ele oferece em substituição aos espetáculos franceses têm como centro a figura do cidadão ator e espectador de si mesmo. O personagem o outro que o ator representa, muitas vezes enquanto mera projeção de si mesmo deve ganhar verdade para que o teatro ganhe força. Esse novo ator, com sua faculdade de iludir a partir de sua verdade cênica, está relacionado com o philosophe e o artista que foi Rousseau. Isto porque buscou, obsessivamente, na prática de seu pensamento a coerência deste, fazendo de sua vida o palco de sua imaginação inflamadaIn French Enlightenment, theatre {{was one of}} {{the main}} subjects discussed among its thinkers they used to be called philosophes, who fiercely expressed their ideas about the theatrical performance phenomenon and its possible pedagogical effectiveness, as well as about its social and political implications in 18 th Century France. Jean-Jacques Rousseau playwright, musician, poet, novelist, that is: a philosophe found, on his view about theatre, the metaphor of the human laceration, that occurred in the passage of man's state of nature for that of life in society. The conflict between being and seeming, as well as the duel between amour de soi, which is present in the natural being, and amour propre, which artificializes the social being, is a fundamental matter for the understanding of the Genevan philosophe. Though this subject runs trough all his work, it is in the Lettre à <b>d</b> <b>Alembert</b> sur les spectacles that Rousseau devotes himself exclusively to perform his criticism about spectacles. Besides that, the text also brings a definition of the talent and the craft of the comedien, which is also suitable to the acteur, that is, the acting artist as a whole, be they a singer at Ópera Royal de Paris or a tragedian at Comédie Française. Thus, this research opted for the term actor, once it has the advantage of updating both the terms comédien and acteur of the French context at that time. Published in 1758, the Lettre constituted the response to <b>d</b> <b>Alembert</b> who, in his entry Genève, da Encyclopédie, defended theatre and its actors, then seen as socially inferior and devoid of political and religious rights. For that reason, the philosopher proposed the formation of a theatre company in Genève, in order to help educate the taste of Genevan citizens, an idea which would be strongly and radically rejected by Rousseau. The Lettre directly addresses the relation among the spectacles, the actor s performance and the corruption of the man in the society, and the aforementioned conflict between being and seeming is once again present. Such opposition is focused on the scope of the Parisian spectacles, designed as signs of a society which was accustomed to appearances and trivia that made the man more and more artificial, and therefore alienated from their essence and the virtues which are necessary for the constitution of a worthy citizen. 7 The work also offers a synthetic definition of the talent of the comedian and their art of imitating, that is, of adopting a character which is different from the one they have. Thus, the actor's craft is the simulation, the clear expression of the conflict between being and seeming, once it lives in their ability to deceive, to seduce the audience, seeming to be what they are not, offering themselves as a show in exchange for money. Rousseau therefore criticizes the luxurious habits and morals of the actor, mainly because it makes use of those artifices to corrupt the youth. To the author of the Lettre, the interpreter, because of their ability to switch characters in scenic play, becomes a metaphor for the paradoxical condition of man, which distanced themselves from nature and created the spectacle of culture. Rousseau's passion for theatre did not stop him from criticizing it so ruthlessly, as he saw in it not only a specific type of artistic representation, but also the representation of the condition of the human laceration. It was necessary, therefore, a new theater, with new actors capable and true in their craft of lying. That is the critic of representation that ran through the Lettre à d'Alembert and that made theater an essential paradigm of its author's thinking. It is worth noticing, yet, that the actor's craft may gain scenic efficiency from the criticism processed by Rousseau in that work. The parties that he throws to replace the French spectacles have as their main feature the figure of the citizen - actor and spectator of himself. The character - the one that the actor represents, often as a mere projection of themselves - must earn truth so that the theater earns strength. This new actor, with their ability to conceal through their scenic truth, is related to the philosophe and the artist who was Rousseau. That because he obsessively sought, in the practice of his thought, its coherence, making his life the stage for his aroused imaginatio...|$|R

In this Memoir he mostly {{responds}} to a text published by Borda in 1766, in which the latter strongly criticized the basic concepts and principles of D <b>Alembert</b> <b>s</b> Traité des fluides (1744). This dispute between both scientists arose during the crisis which affected hydrodynamics sciences concerning the concordance between theory and experiments. The partial differential equations obtained by D Alembert in his Essai d une nouvelle théorie de la résistance des fluides (1752) and Euler in its 1755 Memoirs could not have been solved. The one-dimensional approach developed by Daniel Bernoulli in the Hydrodynamica (1738), then adopted by Jean Bernoulli in the Hydraulica (1743) and D Alembert in the Traité des fluides (1744) is based on an approximation, the hypothesis of parallel slices, which is too far from available experimental results. Borda tried to fill this gap in 1766 to lead this research field out of the impasse. In the 57 th Memoir, D Alembert, who had been directly criticized by Borda, gives his opinion on the topic, responds implicitly to Borda critics, comes back on its previous texts and proposes new theoretical research approach. The study of this treaty on mathematical and physical point of view leads to a new analysis of the principles and concepts at the basis of his theory on the fluids, most of them have indeed only be partially studied by historians. It also enable us to compare his works with the ones of the main other stakeholders in hydrodynamics at this time, i. e. Daniel Bernoulli, Jean Bernoulli, Euler and Lagrange, and to give an overview of the consideration they have received and their sustainability. LYON 1 -BU.

Major figures of the avant-garde from those P.

I question the objectivity of Sitney 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between structuralism and lyricism by showing how both kinds of film utilize a self-reflexivity that produces a mise en abyme in which the world viewed constantly exceeds its own inscription. ^ Towards an “Infinite Cinema:” American Avant-Garde Film and its Modernist Inheritance understands the affects of the American avant-garde 2 ̆ 7 s theorizing of film in the context of subjective desires and anxieties that accompanied film 2 ̆ 7 s genesis in the 19 th century.

Then you believe both that it is raining and that you don 2 ̆ 7 t {{believe that it}} is raining. This would be an ‘absurd’ thing to believe, yet what you believe might be true. It might be raining, while at the same time, you are completely ignorant {{of the state of the}} weather. But how can it be absurd of you to believe something about yourself that might be true of you? This is Moore 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> as it occurs in thought. Solving the paradox consists in explaining why such beliefs are absurd. I give a survey of some of the main explanations. I largely deal with explanations of the absurdity of ‘omissive’ beliefs with contents of the form p 2 ̆ 6 I don 2 ̆ 7 t believe that p and of ‘commissive beliefs’ with contents of the form p 2 ̆ 6 I believe that not-p as well as beliefs with contents of the form p 2 ̆ 6 I don 2 ̆ 7 t know that p...|$|R

This paper emphasizes the important relationship between the paradox of disclosure and {{the boundaries of the}} firm question. Only legally protected inventions, i. e., patented inventions, may be traded; pre-patent stages of the innovation process may not. Consequently, by force of law, rather than by the guidance of economic principle, pre-patent innovation must be carried out within the boundaries of a single firm...|$|R
40|$|A pragmatic {{account of}} {{scientific}} understanding is used both {{to examine and}} to unify fundamental questions concerning the propensity interpretation of probability and theories of chance, causation, and explanation. One {{of the most important}} problems to be addressed is the problem of defining homogeneous reference classes in theories of chance, causation, and explanation. The consistency of the propensity interpretation is defended against traditional criticisms such as 2 ̆ 2 Humphreys 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox.</b> 2 ̆ 2 It is demonstrated that the application of this interpretation to theories of chance and probabilistic causation provides insights into problems common to both theories. Various approaches to causation are examined, including those based on identifying sufficient causal factors, necessary causal factors, and contrastive causes. These insights are applied to quantum mechanics and are presented in terms of a set of controlled experiments. The study of quantum mechanics focuses on the paradox of the two slit experiment and quantum logical and quantum probabilistic attempts to resolve this paradox. Finally, the analysis of chance and causation provides the basis for a version of the contrastive theory of explanation. This theory of explanation provides a unique {{understanding of the nature of}} explanation, and lessens the impact of the problems of homogeneity and of explanatory ambiguity...|$|R
40|$|John Turri {{gives an}} example that he thinks refutes what he takes to be “G. E. Moore 2 ̆ 7 s view” that omissive assertions such as “It is raining but I {{do not believe that}} it is raining” are “inherently ‘absurd 2 ̆ 7 ”. This is that of Ellie, an eliminativist who makes such assertions. Turri thinks that these are {{perfectly}} reasonable and not even absurd. Nor does she seem irrational if the sincerity of her assertion requires her to believe its content. A commissive counterpart of Ellie is Di, a dialetheist who asserts or believes that: Since any adequate explanation of Moore 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> must handle commissive assertions and beliefs as well as omissive ones, it must deal with Di as well as engage Ellie. I give such an explanation. I argue that neither Ellie 2 ̆ 7 s assertion nor her belief is irrational yet both are absurd. Likewise neither Di 2 ̆ 7 s assertion nor her belief is irrational yet in contrast neither is absurd. I conclude that not all Moore-paradoxical assertions or beliefs are irrational and that the syntax of Moore 2 ̆ 7 s examples is not sufficient for the absurdity found in them...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} (i) people {{overweight}} low probabilities and underweight high probabilities, but (ii) ignore events of extremely low probability and treat extremely high probability events as certain. The main alternative decision theories, rank dependent utility (RDU) and cumulative prospect theory (CP) incorporate (i) but not (ii). By contrast, prospect theory (PT) addresses (i) and (ii) by proposing an editing phase that eliminates extremely low probability events, {{followed by a}} decision phase that only makes a choice from among the remaining alternatives. However, PT allows for the choice of stochastically dominated options, even when such dominance is obvious. We propose to combine PT and CP into composite cumulative prospect theory (CCP). CCP combines the editing and decision phases of PT into one phase and {{does not allow for}} the choice of stochastically dominated options. This, we believe, provides the best available alternative among decision theories of risk at the moment. As illustrative examples, we also show that CCP allows us to resolve three paradoxes: the insurance paradox, the Becker paradox and the St. Petersburg paradox.

The Defence of Contraries Paradoxes against common opinion, here reproduced in the appendix, was hastily published in 1593 by Anthony Munday. the 12 paradoxes were translated from the French ad likewise addressed to the lawyers and wits at the London Inns of Court, {{at the time a}} vital centre of coterie writing, scholarship and patronage.
