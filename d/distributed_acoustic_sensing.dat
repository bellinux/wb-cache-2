Such a system allows acoustic frequency strain signals to be detected over large distances and in harsh environments.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the system}} is {{sensitive}} to both temperature and strain variations these can often be separated as those due to temperature tend to occur at a lower frequency range than strain.

50|$|Phase-sensitive {{coherent}} optical time-domain reflectometry (ϕ-OTDR) is {{a technique}} that can provide sufficient sensitivity and resolution for these <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> systems. Standard optical time-domain reflectometry techniques use light sources with coherence lengths, which are shorter than pulse lengths. This can yield a sum of backscattered intensities from each scattering center, which allows monitoring splices and breaks in fiber optic cables. On the contrary, in ϕ-OTDR-based sensors, the coherence length of lasers is longer than their pulse length. An event near the fiber generates an acoustic wave that affects the optical fiber by changing the phases of the backscattering centers. An analysis of such signals can reveal {{their impact on the}} sensor and monitor located near fiber objects.|$|E

50|$|At {{least two}} fibre-optic leak {{detection}} methods are being commercialized: Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and <b>Distributed</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Sensing</b> (DAS). The DTS method involves {{the installation of}} a fibre-optic cable {{along the length of}} pipeline being monitored. The substances to be measured come into contact with the cable when a leak occurs, changing the temperature of the cable and changing the reflection of the laser beam pulse, signalling a leak. The location is known by measuring the time delay between when the laser pulse was emitted and when the reflection is detected. This only works if the substance is at a temperature different from the ambient environment. In addition, the distributed fibre-optical temperature-sensing technique offers the possibility to measure temperature along the pipeline. Scanning {{the entire length of the}} fibre, the temperature profile along the fibre is determined, leading to leak detection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> {{relies on}} light which is Rayleigh {{backscattered}} from small {{variations in the}} refractive index of the fiber. The backscattered light has the same frequency as the transmitted light. There {{are a number of}} other distributed fiber sensing techniques that rely on different scattering mechanisms and can be used to measure other parameters.Brillouin scatter occurs due to the interaction between the light and acoustic phonons travelling in the fiber. As the light is scattered by a moving phonon, its frequency is shifted by the Doppler effect by around 10 GHz. Light is generated at both at above (anti-Stokes shift) and below (Stokes shift) the original optical frequency. The intensity and frequency shifts of the two components are dependent on both temperature and strain and by measuring the shifts, absolute values of the two parameters can be calculated using a distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system. Brillouin scatter is much weaker than Rayleigh scatter and so the reflections from a number of pulses must be summed together to enable the measurements to be made. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which changes can be measured using Brillouin scatter is typically a few tens of Hz.Raman scatter occurs when light is scattered in interaction with molecular vibrations in the fiber. As with Brillouin scattering, both Stokes and anti-Stokes components are produced and these are shifted from the wavelength of the incident light by several tens of nanometers. By measuring the ratio in intensity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, an absolute value of temperature can be measured by a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system. The larger wavelength shifts compared to Brillouin scatter mean that it is easier to separate the scattered Raman light from the un-shifted Rayleigh scattered component. However the intensity of the Raman scatter is even lower than the Brillouin scatter and so it is normally necessary to average for many seconds or even minutes in order to get reasonable results. Therefore, Raman-based systems are only suitable for measuring slowly varying temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Automated <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> {{systems are}} {{required}} to detect, classify and localize acoustic signals in real-time. Despite the fact that humans are capable of performing <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> tasks with ease {{in a variety of}} situations, the performance of current automated <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> algorithms is limited by seemingly benign changes in environmental or operating conditions. In this work, a framework for acoustic surveillance that is capable of accounting for changing environmental and operational conditions, is developed and analyzed. The algorithms employed in this work utilize non-stationary and nonparametric Bayesian inference techniques to allow the resulting framework to adapt to varying background signals and allow the system to characterize new signals of interest when additional information is available. The performance of each of the two stages of the framework is compared to existing techniques and superior performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated. The algorithms developed operate on the time-domain acoustic signals in a nonparametric manner, thus enabling them to operate on other types of time-series data without the need to perform application specific tuning. This is demonstrated in this work as the developed models are successfully applied, without alteration, to landmine signatures resulting from ground penetrating radar data. The nonparametric statistical models developed in this work for the characterization of acoustic signals may ultimately be useful not only in acoustic surveillance but also other topics within <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing.</b> Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic sensing {{technology}} {{has a long}} history of being implemented in the oil and gas industry; from the early days of measuring seismic activity to determine oil and gas reserve to the present day technology such as fiber optic <b>Distributed</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Sensing</b> (DAS) in the near wellbore measurement. The newly adapted DAS technology is capable of measuring the acoustic signature in the near wellbore fracture region and analyzing the measured data to predict important downhole parameters such as active producing zone, flow rate, etc. However, DAS is still a new technology partially due to the complexity of the acoustic phenomenal it tries to analyze. In this study, how different parameters influence the acoustic behavior is investigated. The study is conducted on a laboratory setup that simulates the downhole condition when fluid flows from the fracture and perforation tunnel to the wellbore. To better simulate the downhole condition, a fracture cell and wellbore assembly are designed and built to conduct the experiments. The laboratory setup and experimental procedure are described in detail in the experimental setup section. The result of the experiments conducted under different conditions is shown in the experimental result section. Based on the experimental result, different parameters change the acoustic signal differently. An empirical correlation is concluded from the experimental result to relate flow rate and acoustic signal. The study also concludes that important downhole parameters such as flow rate can be estimated from the <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> data...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the application of}} changepoint detection methodology {{for the analysis of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> signals. In the first part, we propose a detection procedure for changes in the second-order structure of a univariate time series. This utilises a penalised likelihood based on Whittle’s approximation and allows for a non-linear penalty function. This procedure is subsequently used to detect changes in <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensing</b> data which correspond to external disturbances of the measuring cable. The second part shifts focus to multivariate time series, and {{considers the}} detection of changes which occur in only a subset of the variables. We introduce the concept of changepoint vectors which we use to model such changes. A dynamic programming scheme is proposed which obtains the optimal configuration of changepoint vectors for a given multivariate series. Consideration of pruning techniques suggests that these are not practically viable for this setting. We therefore introduce approximations which vastly improve computational speed with negligible detrimental impact on accuracy.
