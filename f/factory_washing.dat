40|$|The use of {{constructed}} wetland {{to treat}} civil wastewater is become a widespread method. It {{is also true}} that in the last decade this particular technique is becoming more familiar with industrial wastewater treatment. A CW plant used to process the cheese <b>factory</b> <b>washing</b> water provide a discrete quantity of vegetable biomass several times during the year. When the main pollutant is organic based, the final destination of the cut upper side of the plants, could be the anaerobic digestion. In this study was taken under consideration the possibility to use this kind of biomass as a seasonal feed for the anaerobic digestion process. This may allow optimization of the reactor feeding regime and gradually/partially substitute paid biomass with less expensive one. In the experiment was used a self-made 128 L AD pilot plant, already used for similar experiences. With this instrument can be correctly estimate the biogas and methane yield under batch, fed-batch and continuous regime. The test was conducted starting from a situation that simulate a real anaerobic reactor working phase. This start-up stage was conducted loading 50 Kg of cattle slurry mixed with 5 Kg of digestate. Sufficient quantity of Phragmites Australis plants, from Morgex (Aosta - Italy) cheese factory wastewater treatment plant, where harvested and then dried at about 30 °C for almost a month and then mechanically chopped at about 1. 5 mm. When acceptable steady state were reached (methane quality exceeds 50 % of the produced biogas) inside the reactor, the second stage of the experience was performed. The biomass initially loaded was been gradually substitute with an appropriate percentage of cow manure, cheese whey and chopped phragmites. COD behavior, methane and biogas yields, pH, temperatures, and pressure trends were analyze...|$|E

In the 18th and 19th centuries the cotton spinning and weaving industries dominated. These large industries meant that Gontenschwil had the second largest population in the Kulm district. After the collapse of the mid-19th century due to a lack of hydroelectric power, tobacco processing partly replaced the cotton industry. In 1900, in a disused water mill, an aluminum foundry was built. This developed into the Menziken aluminum factory.

In this region, hardcoal mining has been made since 1848 and, based on the records kept since 1865, 328 million tons pit run coal have been produced. Resulted amount of waste from the processing of coal in the coal <b>washing</b> <b>factories</b> is about 114 million tons. Some parts of these coal wastes have been stocked along the coastal lines in ZMA by governmental and private companies while the others have been stored in the valleys and hilly side of inner regions.

In this research, the effects of substituting 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of sugar with Wash and Green-A Syrups on some dough and cake properties, such as pH, viscosity, density, volume, weight loss, moisture, water activity, texture, staling, color and sensory evaluations, are studied. The results of these experiments showed that the pH values were not significantly different among any of the all cake batters and also most of the cake samples. Although differences among viscosity and specific gravity of all treatments were both significant and insignificant, these two parameters resulted in higher volume in all samples than the blank one. The differences in weight loss, moisture content and water activity of samples were insignificant. Evaluating of texture showed that the softness of most of samples is increased and the staling is decreased. Crumb color and sensory evaluations of samples were also affected by the replacement of sucrose with Wash and Green-A Syrups.

40|$|Abstract The {{chemical}} characteristics of spent wash, an effluent from the distillation of ethanol from molasses, can vary, {{depending on the}} initial feed stock and {{the operations of the}} <b>factory.</b> Spent <b>wash</b> from Australia contained large quantities of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), K, N and Cl with moderate to low concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na, and S, and small amounts of trace elements (Fe, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn). Spent wash from Thailand was obtained from whisky distillation and generally had similar chemical attributes to the spent wash from ethanol production, although the Zn concentration was much higher (399 - 974 mg Zn L- 1). Large differences in EC and pH were found between Australian (pH: 4. 08 - 4. 49; EC: 40. 4 - 42. 2 dS m- 1) and Thai spent wash (pH: 7. 86 - 9. 20; EC: 11. 3 - 82. 4 dS m- 1). However, the high concentration of K in spent wash from both manufacturing processes indicates the unique chemical characteristic of wastewater produced from molasses-based distillation. While chemical characterisations of spent wash have shown its potential value as a fertilizer, its utility needs to be more practical than by direct application. This is due to its dilute nature, associated with the presence of organic carbon (OC) and nutrients in soluble form, thus making direct application susceptible to leaching losses of nutrients, especially in soils of low cation exchange capacity (CEC). It was hypothesized that capturing OC and nutrients on a high activity exchanger would overcome this problem. Since the charge on organic components in spent wash is important to the capturing process, pH manipulation {{is one of the major}} factors affecting the efficiency of this capture. The study of the influence of pH on development of charge on organic components in spent wash was undertaken using potentiometric titration. The potentiometric titration, and derived pH buffer curve, showed that the organic components in spent wash comprised a wide range of ionizable organic functional groups behaving like a mix of weak acids. While the inflection point (s) could not be obtained from the potentriometric titration, the absorbance of spent wash in the UV waveband (250 to 400 nm) confirmed the presence of phenolic groups in spent wash. The charge on organic components in spent wash was strongly pH dependent, and highest in the pH range of 4. 0 - 5. 0. The manipulation of pH and salt concentration (EC) was shown to have an effect on flocculation/dispersion and it is inferred that this was due to changes in the molecular arrangement of organic components in spent wash. A coiled configuration is suggested at acidic pH, whereas a linear flexible configuration and macromolecular structure tending to occur at neutral and alkaline pH respectively. Ca-saturated bentonite, originally sourced from Mantuan Downs, Central Queensland, was used in an investigation of the capture of OC and nutrients from Sarina spent wash at different pH values (4. 5, 6. 0, 8. 0). This study demonstrated that manipulation of pH and electrolyte concentration had a small effect on adsorption of OC by the clay, probably the result of effects on the charge characteristics of both clay mineral surfaces and organic molecules and also on molecular sizes of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). The highest absorption of OC was only 28 % for dewatered spent wash, suggesting Ca-saturated bentonite may not be a strong sorbent for DOM from a wastewater of high EC and which contains high concentration of DOC of the composition found in spent wash. The study of the adsorption of K by bentonite in a pure inorganic system (without DOM) indicated sufficiently high concentrations of K can compete with divalent Ca 2 + for exchange sites on the clay surface. The adsorption of K in an organic system (the DOM component in spent wash) showed that DOM had a positive influence on adsorption of inorganic ions (e. g. K+). Characterisation of the spent wash/ clay mixture demonstrated its potential to be used as a soil ameliorant on the basis of the large quantity of OC and nutrients it contained (especially N and K). Wet and dry organic clays were produced and assessed as ameliorants in a glasshouse trial using forage oat (Avena sativa var. Coolobah) as test species. This pot study indicated a positive influence of application of either wet or dry organic clay on crop biomass at the high application rate (equivalent to 40 tonnes ha- 1). The high proportional K recovery from this high application rate application suggests that organic clays can be used as K fertilizer. The crop nutrient uptake data also indicated its use as a source of S and Mn...|$|R
