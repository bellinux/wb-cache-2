5000|$|The slowest gears (designated '1' or low gear) in most {{automotive}} applications {{allow for}} three to four <b>engine</b> <b>rotations</b> for each output revolution (3:1). High, or [...] "top", gear in many earlier three or four speed manual transmissions locks the output shaft to spin at the same speed as the engine (1:1). Five and six speed gearboxes are almost always 'overdrive' in top gear with the engine turning less than a full turn for each revolution of the output shaft, 0.8:1 for example (however, the final drive, or differential, always has further reduction gearing).|$|R
5000|$|The {{selection}} of the six engines, and their specific placement on the wing's leading edge, were fitted to reduce torque - a trio of counterclockwise <b>rotation</b> <b>engines</b> mounted on the port wing, and a trio of clockwise <b>rotation</b> <b>engines</b> on the starboard wing as seen forward from [...] "behind" [...] each engine, resulting in the props rotating [...] "away" [...] from {{each other at the}} tops of their arcs, as did the counter-rotating twin propellers on the Heinkel He 177.|$|R
50|$|Starting of a {{gas turbine}} <b>engine</b> {{requires}} <b>rotation</b> of the compressor to a speed that provides sufficient pressurised air to the combustion chambers.

5000|$|To {{inspect the}} engine, {{it can be}} {{manually}} [...] "barred over" [...] with a lever, but manual <b>engine</b> <b>rotation</b> is slow and inefficient. In some applications manually barring the engine over can be difficult or impossible. The preferred tool for <b>engine</b> <b>rotation</b> is an electrically powered, hydraulically operated [...] "turning jack". The turning jack uses a hydraulic cylinder and ram assembly that automatically advances to engage {{a hole in the}} flywheel. When the ram reaches its limit, it automatically retracts and advances again to engage another hole. The engine is then progressively rotated through its cycle and can be rotated in either direction by installing the jack {{on either side of the}} engine. Not only is a turning jack faster and more efficient, it is also safer since there is no risk of a barring lever coming loose and causing injury or damage. Also, with a turning jack, there is no need for the mechanic to be in physical contact with the engine at any point during the inspection process.|$|E
50|$|Hall effect sensors {{sense the}} {{direction}} of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the gear box which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a central processing unit.

40|$|The author reviews recent {{progress}} toward understanding blazars that multi-waveband monitoring observations have advanced. The primary techniques include the compilation of multi-waveband light curves, multi-epoch VLBI images at radio wavelengths, plots of linear polarization vs. time at radio through optical wavelengths, and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Correlations and the coincidence or lag of events across wavebands {{and in the}} images indicate where the events take place relative to the “core” that lies ≳ 0. 5 pc from the central <b>engine.</b> <b>Rotations</b> of the polarization electric vector suggest a helical geometry of the magnetic field upstream of the millimeter-wave core, while rapid fluctuations in degree and position angle of polarization imply that the jet plasma is turbulent in and downstream of the core. The author is developing a numerical model that simulates the emission from such turbulence as it interacts with a conical standing shock in the core region...|$|R

50|$|The {{major change}} for tank use was {{reversing}} {{the direction of}} <b>engine</b> <b>rotation.</b> Automotive gearboxes ran the opposite way to an aircraft propeller and changing direction required modification of the camshaft lobes. The Merlin had its supercharger, reduction gear and other equipment removed from its crankshaft, greatly simplifying its construction. The dimensions were now similar to the Nuffield Liberty engine and it would fit into the Liberty Mark VI version in the Crusader tank.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{characteristic of}} the Warko {{is the absence of}} a clutch: the engine is always connected to the wheels, and the rear drive is obtained by means of an epicyclic system in output. This system, named “power split”, allows the engine to have a [...] "neutral gear": when the engine turns (connected to the sun gear of the epicyclic system), the variator (i.e., the planetary gears) will compensate for the <b>engine</b> <b>rotation,</b> so the outer ring gear (which provides output) remains stationary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Here we {{speculate}} on what observations {{are telling us}} {{about the difference between}} radio-loud and radio-quiet QSOs. The observations are (i) the relation between ultraviolet-optical luminosity and ‘jet power’, (ii) the dependences of emission and absorption line spectra, and the spectral energy distribution, on radio core-dominance, assumed to be an indicator of orientation, (iii) the spectral differences between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSOs, and (iv) the inverse relation between the strength of broad, blended FeII multiplets and [O III]λ 5007, and the apparently-related association between Fe II strength, reddening, broad absorption lines, and scattering polarization. We present and discuss a picture in which there are two main variables: (i) the inclination of the plane of the host galaxy to the axis of the inner jet (the central <b>engine’s</b> <b>rotation</b> axis), and (ii) the angle of the line-of-sight to this rotation axis. The radio-loud QSOs are those with jets aiming away from the plane of the host galaxy. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rotating}} {{mass of the}} engine also made it, in effect, a large gyroscope. During level flight the effect was not especially apparent, but when turning the gyroscopic precession became noticeable. Due to {{the direction of the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>rotation,</b> left turns required effort and happened relatively slowly, combined with a tendency to nose up, while right turns were almost instantaneous, with a tendency for the nose to drop. [...] In some aircraft, this could be advantageous in situations such as dogfights. The Sopwith Camel suffered {{to such an extent that}} it required left rudder for both left and right turns, and could be extremely hazardous if the pilot applied full power at the top of a loop at low airspeeds. Trainee Camel pilots were warned to attempt their first hard right turns only at altitudes above 1000 ft. The Camel's most famous German foe, the Fokker Dr.I triplane, also used a rotary engine, usually the Oberursel Ur.II clone of the French-built Le Rhone 9J 110 hp powerplant.|$|R
50|$|The Sarich orbital {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine, invented in 1972 by Ralph Sarich, an engineer from Perth, Australia, which features orbital rather than reciprocating motion of its internal parts. It differs from the conceptually similar Wankel engine by using a generally prismatic shaped rotor that orbits the axis of the <b>engine,</b> without <b>rotation,</b> rather than the rotating trilobular rotor of the Wankel.|$|R
50|$|On older engines it {{is common}} to set the {{ignition}} timing using a timing light, which flashes in time with the ignition system (and hence <b>engine</b> <b>rotation),</b> so when shone on the timing marks makes them appear stationary due to the stroboscopic effect. The ignition timing can then be adjusted to fire at the correct point in the engine's rotation, typically a few degrees before top dead centre and advancing with increasing engine speed. The timing can be adjusted by loosening and slightly rotating the distributor in its seat.|$|E
5000|$|Between these {{extremes}} of engagement and disengagement the clutch slips to varying degrees. When slipping it still transmits torque despite {{the difference in}} speeds between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input. Because this torque is transmitted by means of friction rather than direct mechanical contact, considerable power is wasted as heat (which is dissipated by the clutch). Properly applied, slip allows the vehicle to be started from a standstill, {{and when it is}} already moving, allows the <b>engine</b> <b>rotation</b> to gradually adjust to a newly selected gear ratio.|$|E
50|$|T-VIS is {{intended}} to improve the low-end torque of high-performance, four-stroke internal combustion engines - by changing the geometry of the intake manifold according to the <b>engine</b> <b>rotation</b> speed. The system uses two separate intake runners per cylinder, one being equipped with a butterfly valve that can either open or close the runner. All valves are attached to a common shaft which is rotated by a vacuum actuator outside the manifold. T-VIS does not actually keep one of the intake valves from opening or seal off the port for one valve.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop the piston ring damage {{detection}} technique using vibration analysis. Vibration analysis was performed by measuring vibration in four stroke engine which were worn and scratched on its piston ring, then compare it with the vibrations generated by engine which had a good conditions. Tests carried out on <b>engine</b> <b>rotations</b> of 750, 1500, and 2250 rpm, where the sensor were placed on the cylinder head and cylinder block. Vibration measurement produced a signal in the time domain, which then be analysed their signal energy by manual calculation which based on trapezoidal rule. Result of the research showed that the vibration signal energy decrease in all of the strokes of the defect piston ring. It was caused by the pressure of the defect piston ring smaller than the good piston ring. The decrease of vibration signal energy in suction and compression stroke were greater than the power and exhaust stroke. Indication of piston ring defect could be shown from the decrease in the vibration signal energy in all of the strokes...|$|R
5000|$|The CX series {{feature a}} {{crankshaft}} configuration aligned longitudinally with {{the axis of}} bike, similar to the Moto Guzzi layout. Unlike a [...] "boxer" [...] flat-twin, the cylinders protrude at an angle above the horizontal. The included angle of the CX is 80°, and the heads are twisted 22° so that the inlet tracts do {{not interfere with the}} rider's legs. A camshaft nestles {{at the base of the}} V between the cylinders. Although Honda generally favors OHC engines, the cylinder head twist necessitated the use of stubby pushrods to operate the four overhead valves per cylinder, with a forked rocker arm acting off each pushrod. The 5-speed transmission is located below the crankshaft, with both in the same housing, an arrangement which keeps the engine short (length wise) but quite tall. The engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio and 9,650 rpm redline. Just as with the Honda Gold Wing, the transmission spins contrariwise to the <b>engine's</b> <b>rotation</b> to help counteract the engine torque's tendency to tip the bike slightly to one side when the throttle is opened or closed.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} are: (1) To know the effect of CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) roller diameter to engine power on Yamaha Mio Sporty 2007, (2) To know the effect of variation of <b>engine</b> <b>rotations</b> to <b>engine</b> power on Yamaha Mio Sporty 2007, (3) To know the interaction between CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) roller diameter and variation of <b>engine</b> <b>rotations</b> to <b>engine</b> power on Yamaha Mio Sporty 2007. The research used experimental methods. Techniques of data analysis in this study using the descriptive data analysis graphically illustrates the results {{of research in the}} histogram or frequency polygon which connects between the variables. Based the research can conclude that: (1) Changes {{in the size of the}} diameter of the roller CVT 16 mm is capable of producing maximum power peak in the early rounds of the engine so as to generate a lap down to the more powerful. (2) Changes in the size of the diameter of the roller CVT 17 mm produces decreased power because of too rapid movement of the roller is not in accordance with engine speed so that the workload is too imposing received roller CVT. (3) The use of roller diameter of 16 mm on a CVT motorcycle Yamaha Mio Sporty produce maximum power at engine speed earlier and more optimal than the use of CVT roller 15 mm. On the use of 16 mm diameter roller CVT engine produces maximum power of 4. 55 hp at 7500 rpm engine speed, while the use of 15 mm diameter roller CVT produce power equal to 4. 54 hp at 7800 rpm engine speed. (4) The use of roller diameter of 17 mm on a CVT motorcycle Yamaha Mio Sporty produce too rapid achievement of resources so that maximum power is not optimal. On the use of CVT roller diameter 17 mm produces a maximum power of 4. 48 hp at 7700 rpm engine speed. (5) The increase in engine speed can increase the power generated at the wheel axle to the maximum because the larger the engine speed will cause a centrifugal force generated CVT roller so that the greater the power of the machine can be supplied with up to the axle. The increase in engine speed upon reaching the maximum power to the power generated at the wheel axis decreases. Keywords: CVT roller diameter, engine speed variatiom, engin...|$|R
50|$|Nitromethane nitro powered models utilize {{a single}} servo for {{throttle}} and braking control; {{rotation of the}} servo in one direction will cause the throttle on the carburetor to open, providing more air and fuel mixture to the internal combustion <b>engine.</b> <b>Rotation</b> of the servo {{in the other direction}} causes torque to be applied to a linkage and cam which causes friction with the braking material.

40|$|Spark {{ignition}} engines {{have many}} advantages, but {{to increase the}} power and efficiency, {{they have a problem}} to set the right ignition timing, at which the maximum power can be achieved. In reality, the optimum ignition timing is immediately prior to, or close to knock (detonation). On the other hand, the value of this optimum ignition timing is dependent primarily on the rotation of the crank shaft and the level of throttle openings. To provide the right timing, it is very difficult if only using mechanical control system as found in conventional engines. So, in this study, a new electro-mechanical method based on Fuzzy Logic Ignition Controller (FLIC) which follows the pattern of the timing in the knock chart was created. In fact the results of the FLIC study, was able to provide correction for each ignition, according to the data on the chart of the optimal ignition timings for all combinations of <b>engine</b> <b>rotations</b> and throttle openings.
