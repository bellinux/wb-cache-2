5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} tear gas and other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration.

CS <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the guns}} that sank with Kronan were {{salvaged}} in the 1680s, but eventually the wreck fell into obscurity. Its exact position was rediscovered in 1980 by the amateur researcher Anders Franzén, who had also located the 17th-century warship Vasa in the 1950s. Yearly diving operations have since surveyed and excavated the wreck site and salvaged artifacts, and Kronan <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> widely publicized shipwreck in the Baltic after Vasa. More than 30,000 artifacts have been recovered, and many have been conserved and put on permanent public display at the Kalmar County Museum in Kalmar.

5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E

5|$|Riverside and Brooklyn saw modest growth until 1887, {{when the}} city of Jacksonville annexed them and {{established}} a streetcar line. Following the Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed most of Downtown Jacksonville, many displaced residents moved to Riverside. Wealthy citizens built mansions close to the river, while the less well-to-do purchased more modest bungalows and other plantation houses further inland. The neighborhood grew steadily, with development continuing well beyond its original bounds to the south, until {{the collapse of the}} Florida land boom in the late 1920s. During this period, so many architects working in such a wide variety of contemporary styles experimented in Riverside that it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> architecturally diverse neighborhood in Florida. Largely due to Riverside's profusion of bungalow plantation houses, Jacksonville has what is likely the largest number of such structures in the state.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish fleet had {{suffered}} a major blow by losing its two largest ships, its commander-in-chief {{and one of its}} most experienced admirals. Even after the battle, the misfortunes continued. Äpplet came off its moorings at Dalarö, went aground and sank. Around fifty survivors were picked up by pursuing Danish ships and taken as prisoners to Copenhagen. The battle gave Denmark undisputed naval supremacy and the Swedish fleet did not dare to venture out {{for the rest of the}} year. The army that had been amassed in Denmark could now be shipped to Scania to take the war to Swedish soil and on 29 June 1676, 14,500 troops were landed at Råå south of Helsingborg. The Battle of Öland was the first major Swedish defeat at sea to Denmark and was followed by further Swedish defeats at Møn and Køge Bay in 1677. The latter was a resounding success for Admiral Niels Juel and <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> celebrated victory in Danish naval history.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{removal from}} office in 1977 <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable example of power {{transfer}} in the late Brezhnev Era. According to Robert Vincent Daniels, Podgorny was before his removal the second {{most powerful man in}} the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin. The post of Chairman of the Presidium had acquired more powers during his tenure, and had changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny's fall, the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. On 24 May 1977, a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo. The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, he got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members. The Central Committee had however only voted him off the Politburo, and Podgorny still retained the position of Chairman of the Presidium. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny's name disappeared from Soviet media. The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against détente and producing more consumer goods. Podgorny finally lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977.|$|E
