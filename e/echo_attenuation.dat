40|$|The {{transmission}} of a spatial acoustical impression is one aim of high-quality video conferencing systems. Therefore, the {{transmission of}} stereo speech signals is a major task of such a device. Compared to the mono-case, specific problems arise, if an acoustic echo canceller (AEC) is one component of the transmission device. Its <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> in the receiving room degrades, if spatial statistics in the sending room vary. Simulation results indicate that short echo cancellers are less sensitive regarding this “stereo problem”. However, to achieve sufficient <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> a post-filter should be applied. In this paper, we introduce a new method to design a post-filter for stereo acoustic echo cancellation. A vital task during the design procedure is the estimation of the residual echo’s power spectral density (PSD) at {{the output of the}} stereo acoustic echo canceller (Stereo AEC). This estimate is sensitive regarding the “stereo problem”, too. Therefore, we show up an effective way to increase its robustness and give a theoretical foundation. The result is a combination of a short Stereo AEC and a post-filter, which reveals less and shorter degradation of <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> after spatial modifications in the sending room than a long Stereo AEC, which shows the same steady-state performance. 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a new technique to estimate the residual echo at the output of an acoustic echo canceller (AEC). It is known that the compensation filter of the AEC {{has to be very}} long in reverberant environments in order to provide sufficient <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation.</b> However, high filter or-ders involve long convergence periods during initialisation or after modifications of the echo path impulse response. In these periods poor <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> leads to undesired artifacts. One possible solution to this problem is to use a low-order and quickly converging AEC in combination with a Wiener post-filter after the AEC. Therefore, the power spectral density (PSD) of the residual echo has to be esti-mated properly. However, the problem is to achieve reliable estimates in periods of double-talk or during modifications of the echo path impulse response. This paper suggests a new method for estimating the residual echo with the help of minimum statistics to suppress interferences by near-end speech during double-talk situations. 1...|$|E

Nevertheless, the intensity of the characteristic peak decreases with increasing membrane permeability, from which the exchange time may be estimated. We then analyze the experimental 1 H PGSE results of the erythrocytes suspension system. The water-residence lifetime in the erythrocyte is obtained to be 10 ms, which is the same as that estimated from the two-region approximation. Furthermore, the PGSE attenuation curve of addition of p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (p-CMBS) is also discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Translational {{diffusion}} is {{the most}} fundamental form of transport in chemical and biochemical systems. Pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance provides a convenient and noninvasive means for measuring translational motion. In this method the attenuation of the echo signal from a Hahn spin-echo pulse sequence containing a magnetic field gradient pulse in each � period is {{used to measure the}} displacement of the observed spins. In the present article, the physical basis of this method is considered in detail. Starting from the Bloch equations containing diffusion terms, the (analytical) equation linking the <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> to the diffusion of the spin for the case of unrestricted isotropic diffusion is derived. When the motion of the spin occurs within a confined geometry or is anisotropic, such as in in vivo systems, the <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> also yields information on the surrounding structure, but as the analytical approach becomes mathematically intractable, approximate or numerical means must be used to extract the motional information.

40|$|Measurement by two nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) techniques of the mean residence time τa of water molecules inside Chlorella vulgaris (Beijerinck) var. “viridis” (Chodot) is reported. The first is the Conlon and Outhred (1972 Biochim Biophys Acta 288 : 354 - 361) technique in which extracellular water is doped with paramagnetic Mn 2 + ions. Some complications in application of this technique are identified as being caused by the affinity of Chlorella cell walls for Mn 2 + ions which shortens the NMR relaxation times of intra- and extracellular water. The second is based upon observations of effects of diffusion on the spin echo of intra- and extracellular water. <b>Echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> of intracellular water is distinguished from that of extracellular water by {{the extent to which}} diffusive motion is restricted. Intracellular water, being restricted to the cell volume, suffers less <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation.</b> From the dependence of echo amplitude upon gradient strength at several values of echo time, the mean residence time of intracellular water can be determined.

We investigate the diffusion of water across a similar to 50 mum thick film formed between planes of glass. The diffusion time t is changed almost three orders of magnitude. For short t, the root-mean-square displacement increases with a rate which is slightly less than for freely diffusing water. At t longer than 0. 3 s, the displacement,is constant at 24 mum which implies that t he water is confined in the measuring direction defined by the applied gradient pulses. Perfectly smooth and aligned planes give rise to sharp diffraction-like features on the <b>echo</b> <b>attenuation</b> curve, i. e., NMR signal vs. the reciprocal space vector q.

40|$|The {{reversal}} of the time evolution of the local polarization in an interacting spin system involves a sign change of the effective dipolar Hamiltonian which refocuses the 'spin diffusion' process generating a polarization <b>echo.</b> Here, the <b>attenuation</b> of these <b>echo</b> amplitudes {{as a function of}} evolution time is presented for cymantrene and ferrocene polycrystalline samples, involving one and two five spin rings per molecule respectively. We calculate the fraction of polarization which is not refocused because only the secular part of the dipolar Hamiltonian is inverted. The results indicate that, as long as the spin dynamics is restricted to a single ring, the non-inverted part of the Hamiltonian is notable by itself to explain the whole decay of the polarization echoes. A cross over from exponential (cymantrene) to Gaussian (ferrocene) attenuation is experimentally observed. This is attributed to an increase of the relative importance of the spin dynamics, as compared with irreversible interactions, which favors dynamical irreversibility.

Ultrasound evaluation of muscle can identify abnormal echo intensity, size, and movement. Because it is painless and noninvasive, US can be used to evaluate multiple muscles to direct the electrodiagnostic examination or muscle biopsy. Some patterns of muscle involvement can suggest specific etiologies. Most muscular dystrophies show homogenously increased muscle <b>echo</b> intensity with <b>attenuation</b> of the US signal, likely resultant from increased intramuscular fat and fibrosis. Inflammatory myopathies can also show homogenously increased echogenicity but lack the signal attenuation seen in muscular dystrophies.

Advanced age and obesity also impacts muscle size and echo intensity and can hamper efforts to detect mild pathologies. The sensitivity and specificity of US for detecting neuromuscular disease have been best studied in children and depend on the type and severity of the disorder. In general, muscle US yields sensitivities and specificities of 67 % to 100 % for detecting neuromuscular disorders in children and is similar to electromyogram for detection of myopathy.

The echo was filtered and the power spectral density was calculated for attenuation measurement based on insertion loss method. The comparison of power spectral density from a normal and fractured bone showed that average signal power on the fractured bone was lower than the normal bone by 4. 3 dB for both linear and comminuted fractures.
