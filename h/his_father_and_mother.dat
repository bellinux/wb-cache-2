It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> wrote out copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|Melvin served out {{his term}} until October 31, 1906, when he {{suffered}} a stroke while holding a session of the circuit court in Wellsburg. He was paralyzed and lost consciousness {{as a result of}} the stroke, and was assisted from the bench and taken to Wheeling City Hospital in Ward5. By the following day physicians had given up hope for his recovery. Melvin died at 16:00 on November 9, 1906, at the hospital as a result of apoplexy. His body was taken to the McLure Hotel on November 10, where it lay in state until November 12.

5|$|The next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, {{calls to}} invite {{him on a}} {{one-on-one}} field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> were worried sick since they didn't know where he was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the devastating effects of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs {{out of his house}} to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and {{has no choice but to}} accept Leslie's death.|$|E
5|$|Through both <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> Hayes was of New England colonial ancestry. His {{earliest}} American ancestor {{emigrated to}} Connecticut from Scotland in 1625. Hayes's great-grandfather, Ezekiel Hayes, was a militia captain in Connecticut in the American Revolutionary War, but Ezekiel's son (Hayes's grandfather, also named Rutherford) left his Branford {{home during the}} war for the relative peace of Vermont. His mother's ancestors arrived in Vermont at a similar time, {{and most of his}} close relatives outside Ohio continued to live there. John Noyes, an uncle by marriage, had been his father's business partner in Vermont and was later elected to Congress. His first cousin, Mary Jane Noyes Mead, was the mother of sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and architect William Rutherford Mead. John Humphrey Noyes, the founder of the Oneida Community, was also a first cousin. He {{became a member of the}} Sons of the American Revolution based on his descent from Daniel Austin and Elias Birchard.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{attended}} {{elementary and}} middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and a}} half before dropping out following the deaths of <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother.</b> Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E

5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E
25|$|Duarte died {{late that}} summer, in Tomar, of the plague, like <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> (and her mother) before him.

25|$|In February 1538 Jean de Ferrières {{was given}} two benefices by his father. Less {{than two years}} later, however, he was disinherited by both <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> when they made their joint last wills on 23 December 1539. Although {{the reason for his}} {{disinheritance}} is unknown, d'Estang suggests that it may have been due to his abandonment of the Catholic religion.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} tradition {{holds that}} Poirot {{was born in}} the village of Ellezelles (province of Hainaut, Belgium). A few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot {{can be seen in the}} centre of this village.

25|$|Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates {{the nature}} of {{existence}} and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from Zen and Vedantic religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.|$|E
25|$|Oedipus was {{a figure}} {{who was also}} used in the Latin {{literature}} of ancient Rome. Julius Caesar wrote a play on Oedipus, {{but it has not}} survived into modern times. Ovid included Oedipus in Metamorphoses, but only as the person who defeated the Sphinx. He makes no mention of Oedipus' troubled experiences with <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother.</b> Seneca the Younger wrote his own play on the story of Oedipus in the first century AD. It differs in significant ways from the work of Sophocles.|$|E
