40|$|BACKGROUND: Mines are {{hazardous}} {{and workers}} can suffer {{many types of}} accidents caused by fire, flood, explosion or collapse. Injury incidence rates in mining are considerably higher than those registered by other economic sectors. One {{of the main reasons}} for this high-level incidence rate is the existence {{of a large number of}} dangerous workplaces. OBJECTIVE: This work analyzes the influence that occupational safety management had on the accidents that took place in Spanish mining of <b>industrial</b> and ornamental <b>stone</b> during the period 2007 – 2008. METHODS: Primary data sources are: (a) Results from a statistical study of the occupational health and safety management practices of 71 quarries defined by a questionnaire of 41 items; and (b) Occupational accidents registered in the Spanish <b>industrial</b> and ornamental <b>stone</b> mining throughout the period 2007 – 2008. RESULTS: The obtained results indicate that workplaces with a low average score in the analysis of occupational safety management have a higher incidence rate of accidents.

The serpentinites most commonly used worldwide come from India, Pakistan or Egypt. Spain has traditionally quarried two ultramafic massifs, one in Galicia (Verde Pirineos) and one in Andalucía (Verde Macael). Some of these quarries were small family-run businesses. In both cases, these rocks are commercially available as “green marble. ” These serpentinites commonly have {{a high degree of}} carbonation, but the process does not always take place with the same intensity. Carbonate can act as a cementing agent of the other phases, increasing the mechanical strength parameters. As a result, an improvement in the strength conditions is achieved, but a misinterpretation of the suitability of the rock may occur because a perception among users that “green marble” is similar to geologically defined marble. This may lead to inappropriate applications as an ornamental stone.

The overall objective is to reduce the environmental impacts associated with production processes and promote industrial scenarios that integrate with the context. One of the possible strategies for the reduction of the environmental impacts generated by industry is the waste/scraps recycling and reuse (turning them into secondary raw material). This aims is possible through an optimized design of process, product and its life cycle. Currently there are many manufacturing sectors {{in which there is a}} considerable production of waste products and in many cases these scraps are landfilled with the result of wasting natural resources. One of the sectors that generate many scraps/waste is the natural stone in which for every ton of material produced, at least a ton of scrap material is destined to local special landfill. The research project analyse the environmental issues connected to stone production processes, by focusing on the very significant scraps production and on the possible ways for reducing and reusing them. Intervening on this aspect of the production of natural stone makes possible to obtain many benefits, both at the global scale (pollution reduction, improvement of the environmental profile of the product, sustainable products, etc), both at the local scale (control of the orographic changes, landfill management, reduction of local impacts such as land consumption, etc). The aim of this research is to suggest possible strategic scenarios that may improve the environmental impact of the supply chain and the product, through the assessment and reuse of pre-consumer scraps.

40|$|Ignacy Leon Kotkowski – a landowner, industrialist, {{grandfather}} of Witold Gombrowicz, married to Aniela Kotkowska from the Kotkowski family – bought in 1838 from the Małachowski family {{the village of}} Bodzechów together with the manor house and over 1400 acres of fertile lands, woods and meadows. On these lands he built very profitable ironworks with a puddling furnace, a paper mill, a brickyard, a lumber mill, mills and a nailery. In 1885 the squire of the estate of Bodzechów and Małoszyce, Ignacy Kotkowski, purchased in the neighbouring village of Doły Biskupie a brick mill, {{as well as the}} nearby lands. The village of Doły Biskupie situated at the Świślina River abounded in rich stone deposits (dolomite). Therefore he established an enterprise there called “Ignacy Kotkowski’s ‘Doły and Święcie’ Sandstone Mines, Factory of Stone Products”. He built three state-of-the-art water mills on the Świślina River. Banked up waters of the river enclosed in the built by Kotkowski channels powered the mills’ wheels. Sandstone was extracted with the use of modern technologies. Cutting of stone took place in three lumber mills. Huge marble slabs were transported by a narrow-gauge railway. Apart from extracting the sandstone, it was machined, and many products were manufactured from it, for instance: carved windows, doors, tower ornaments, cornices, balconies, staircases, floors, entrance gates, tables and others. Mills, the factory of stone products, sandstone mines together with the nearby factory housing estate, constitued the property, which was entered in the records as “Doły” Mill Settlement. The development of the factory rewuired constant investments, i. e. building of the subsequent buildings which were intended for workshops, or flats for managers and workers. Efficient transport, in turn, required bulding of a road that would connect the factory with the iron railway, as well as bridges on ravines and the channel leading to the factory in Nietulisk. The speedy development of the factory provided employment and wages to a considerable number of inhabitants. Ignacy Kotkowski died in 1901. In 1902 the estate of “Doły” Mill Settlement became the property of his daughter, Marcelina Antonina Gombrowiczowa, née Kotkowska. The Doły Biskupie settlement is the proof of utilizing the waters of the Świślina River for almost 400 years in one and the same place. In te course of those years water systems, which set in motion respectively the mill, <b>industrial</b> mills, the <b>stone</b> factory, as well as the carboard factory, have been perfected. Such a long and coherent industrial tradition was possible thanks to Ignacy Kotkowski’s ability to use the local raw materials and natural sources of energy. The history of this town as well as the industried activity of one landowning family shows the difficult process of industrialization of our country.
