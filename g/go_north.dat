5|$|Ibrahim {{tried to}} enter Mani from the {{north-east}} near Almiro on June 21, 1826, {{but he was}} forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to hold off the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and <b>go</b> <b>north</b> to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses.

5|$|In late 1777, {{the main}} part of the Tây Sơn army left Saigon to <b>go</b> <b>north</b> and attack the Trịnh lords, who ruled the other half of Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh stealthily {{returned}} to the mainland, rejoining his supporters and reclaimed the city. He was crucially aided by the efforts of Đỗ Thanh Nhơn, who had organized an army for him, which was supplemented by Cambodian mercenaries and Chinese pirates. The following year, Nhon expelled further Tây Sơn troops from the surrounding province of Gia Định, and inflicted heavy losses on the Tây Sơn naval fleet. Taking advantage of the more favorable situation, Nguyễn Ánh sent a diplomatic mission to Siam to propose a treaty of friendship. However, this pact was derailed in 1779 when the Cambodians staged an uprising against their pro-Siamese leader Ang Non. Nguyễn Ánh sent Nhon to help the uprising, which saw Ang Non defeated decisively and executed.|$|E

5|$|North of {{the first}} exit with St. Paul Street, Ridge Road resurfaces as East Ridge Road, which {{parallels}} the expressway to the north. NY104 continues through Rochester and Irondequoit, connecting to North Clinton Avenue, Seneca Avenue, Hudson Avenue, Carter Street, Portland Avenue, North Goodman Street and Culver Road by way of interchanges. Between the Goodman Street and Culver Road exits, NY104 passes the former Medley Centre. East of Culver, NY104 encounters NY590 and connects to NY590 southbound by way of an interchange. East Ridge Road runs {{through the middle of}} this interchange, although there are no connections between Ridge and NY104. There is also no access from NY104 eastbound to NY590 northbound; eastbound traffic must take Culver Road in order to <b>go</b> <b>north</b> toward Sea Breeze. Just east of the NY590 interchange, NY104 becomes the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay by way of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. An access road between NY104 just west of the bridge and NY590 at Titus Avenue was once planned. Although entrance and exit ramps were built for the connection along NY104, the rest of the link was never built, leaving no access from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound and from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound.|$|E
5|$|The first {{alternative}} was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross it, going through Newbury {{and returning to}} Reading's fortifications, thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London. The disadvantage to {{this was the time}} it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex's position and the Kennet. The second, and the option Essex initially took, was to <b>go</b> <b>north,</b> either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists. If Essex was able to cross to {{the west bank of the}} River Avon, he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army. His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September, with the rest of the soldiers quickly following. The Royalists were left wrong-footed; Charles did not discover Essex's retreat for another 24 hours, during which the gap between the armies widened. The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September, with Rupert's cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat.|$|E
