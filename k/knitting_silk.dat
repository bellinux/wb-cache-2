40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{applies the}} principles of biology and engineering {{to the development of}} viable substitutes that restore, maintain or improve the function of human tissues. It depends upon a temporary scaffold that is an architecture that functions to mechanically support the cells and regulate the functions of cells in a manner analogous to extracellular matrix of mammalian tissue. It also assist in 3 D tissue formation or organogenesis. The scaffolds must have the capability to incorporate mammalian tissue and assist in their growth, migration and differentiation which will help in tissue regeneration. Due to its unique properties, it is used in implantation. The most common injuries include the damage of cartilages, tendons and ligaments. So globally musculoskeletal tissue engineering is given undue importance. During ligament injury the injured ligaments are not successfully replaced by ligament-alone grafts. Thus {{there is a need for}} the construction of a composite scaffold to allow stem cell to differentiate into fibrocartilage that bridges of Bone-Ligament interface. The current project has focused on the fabrication of a silk-based knitted scaffold for fibrocartilage regeneration. Bio-polymers such as silk solution and chitosan were used for surface modification of the <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> scaffold, to ensure differentiation of the MSCs into fibrocartilage lineages. Lyophilization process was used for coating of polymers over the <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> scaffold. Characterization of the polymer coated <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> scaffold was done using XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, FTIR. Water absorption capacity of the <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> scaffold was also studied.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} being {{a central}} forum for ground breaking {{scientific research and}} developments in biomedical applications caters to design and fabrication of new tissues by development of biodegradable substitutes for functional restoration & regeneration of impaired organs. The key to success in tissue engineering is customized and precisely optimized scaffolds specific to the tissue type. With the highest demand in musculoskeletal tissue engineering, it’s a challenge to construct a complex scaffold for incorporating interface organ to bridge ligament/tendon with bone to replace injured ligaments beyond repair. Such a scaffold must act as a template for tissue formation providing a 3 D platform to the seeded cells {{in addition to providing}} enough mechanical strength required at soft to hard tissue interface to construct a Bone-Ligament-Bone graft. In the current project, a scaffold for bone compartment of a multi-compartmental B-L-B graft was fabricated by <b>knitting</b> <b>silk</b> fibroin as core material to impart mechanical strength. Hydroxyapatite (HA) being known for its osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, was integrated on the surface of silk fibroins by electrospinning along with the biodegradable polymer, PCL(Poly caprolactone). The fabricated scaffold was characterized for mechanical properties like biodegradability, stiffness, porosity in addition to biocompatibility features like cell adhesion efficiency, cell proliferation after seeding fibroblasts. The nano-microscaffold showed the capability to support growth and proliferation of seeded fibroblast cells and an average yield stress of 38 ± 0. 18 kg/cm 2. It was concluded that the fabricated scaffold can be effectively used for bone tissue engineering that needs further confirmation using bone cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: A randomized, {{double-blind}} study designed {{to compare the}} efficacy of DermaSilk (R) versus a sleeve of similar structure but minus the AEM 5772 / 5 antimicrobial finish {{in the treatment of}} atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: To evaluate the clinical effect of adding an antimicrobial finish to <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> garments on eczema severity and on pruritus in patients with AD. Methods: Thirty patients aged between 3 and 31 years (mean 14. 2 +/- 7. 7) were enrolled. The inclusion criterion was that the patients presented with active AD with eczematous lesions located on the arms without any sign of infection. Each participant was given a set of 4 pairs of <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> tubular sleeves marked with seams of different colours. Only one colour was treated with AEGIS AEM 5772 / 5. This information was unknown to both the clinicians and the patients/parents. At baseline (T 0) and after 7 (T 7), 14 (T 14), 21 (T 21) and 28 (T 28) days, the patients were evaluated using the following methods: photographic assessment, local modified SCORAD index adapted for only the arm, and parent/patient assessment of pruritus measured with a visual analogue scale. Results: The mean local SCORAD index of both the DermaSilk- and the unmodified-silk-covered arms decreased significantly between baseline (T 0) and the end of study (T 28). However, while the DermaSilk group showed a constant decrease each week, the unmodified-silk group showed a significant decrease only in the first 2 weeks of the study. Also the decrease in pruritus values between T 0 and T 28 was greater for the DermaSilk group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of including the AEM 5772 / 5 finish to the specially <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> for a long-term improvement of atopic eczema symptoms...|$|R

40|$|The {{ligament}} is a {{connective tissue}} that bridges two bones and stabilizes the joints during motor activities. Anterior Cruciate Ligament(ACL) {{is one of}} the primary ligaments present in the knee connecting notch of the femur leads back into the femoral chondyle and fixes deep within tibia of the lower limb. ACL is the most commonly injured ligament among young and active individuals. Further,like other ligaments,ACL fails to heal optimally due to its low vascularity. The core insertional strength of ligaments is provided by a specialized organ called enthesis comprising of avascular fibrocartilage. Thus,if the current method of ligament tissue engineering would be integrated with pre-installation of enthesis at the bone-ligament interface,the original insertional strength can be envisaged in the tissue engineered construct. The current research project focuses on the fabrication of a silk based multi-compartmental scaffold,reinforced with natural polymers using a series of cross-linkers {{that can be used for}} ligament tissue engineering by enhancing the biocompatibility features. Briefly,the backbone of the scaffold was made by <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> followed by a coating of biopolymers like chitosan and gelatin for ligament and enthesial region respectively by the simple soaking method. To increase the coating yield and the stability of biopolymers on the <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> scaffolds, four different cross-linkers(i. e. araldite DY-T,PEG-dimethacrylate, glutaraldehyde and tyrosinase) were used and the outcomes were compared. These cross-linkers showed improvement in surface morphology, absorption,biodegradation and mechanical studies when compared with non-crosslinked scaffolds. TGA and FTIR spectroscopy were conducted for thermal and structural behavior analysis. MG- 63 cells were used for biocompatibility of the scaffold using MTT assay. For both chitosan and gelatin coated scaffolds,tyrosinase was found to be the most suitable crosslinker on account of biocompatibility...|$|R

The effect of these treatments on the mechanical properties of the textile constructs was evaluated by tensile tests in dry and hydrated states. Surface properties such as morphology, topography, wettability and elemental composition were also affected by the applied treatments. The in vitro biological behavior of L 929 fibroblasts revealed that cells were able to adhere and spread both on the untreated and surface-modified textile constructs.

First, a silk-collagen scaffold was fabricated by combining sericin-extracted <b>knitted</b> <b>silk</b> fibroin mesh and type I collagen to mimic the components of the ligament. Scaffolds were electron-beam sterilized and rolled up to replace the ACL in 20 rabbits in the scaffold group, and autologous semitendinosus tendons were used to reconstruct the ACL in the autograft control group. At 4 and 16 weeks after surgery, grafts were retrieved and analyzed for neoligament regeneration and tendon-bone healing. To evaluate neoligament regeneration, H&E and immunohistochemical staining was performed, and to assess tendon-bone healing, micro-CT, biomechanical test, H&E and Russell-Movat pentachrome staining were performed. Cell infiltration increased over time in the scaffold group, and abundant fibroblast-like cells were found in the core of the scaffold graft at 16 weeks postoperatively. Tenascin-C was strongly positive in newly regenerated tissue at 4 and 16 weeks postoperatively in the scaffold group, similar to observations in the autograft group.
