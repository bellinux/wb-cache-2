5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack <b>domestic</b> <b>fowl</b> and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E

Physico-chemical nature of fowl's antibody of JE produced by natural infection and their maternal antibody in the sera of chicks were examined. The results are briefly summarized as follows. 1) As to the herons captured in Tsudaka Town, two out of six adult night herons and three out of the four chicks showed positive HI reaction. On the other hand, HI reaction in the sera of two adult white herons and three chicks were negative. 2) As to the herons captured in Okayama City, twenty out of thirtytwo adult night herons and seven out of seventy white herons showed positive HI reaction in 1966 around the time when JE was prevalent in Okayama Prefecture. And six out of eleven night herons and one out of seven white herons showing positive HI reaction, responded positively to 2 -ME sensitivity test. 3) The results indicate that white herons can be also infection source ofJE though less than {{in the case of}} night herons. 4) In the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> (white leghorn) kept at Takahashi District, eight out of twenty-seven fowls showed positive HI reaction. And six out of seven <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> showing positive HI reaction responded positively to 2 -ME sensitive reaction. 5) Transformation of JE antibody in the serum of hen from IgM to IgG was recognized. 6) Domestic chicken's sera having 1 : 640 of HI titer in the original serum and 1 : 320 of HI titer after 2 -ME treatment were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200 and the antibody activities present in the various fractions were determined. HI antibody activities occurred in both IgM and IgG classes of immunoglobulins. 7) Maternal HI antibodies reacting with JE virus were found in newly hatched domestic chickens from the eggs laid by hens with natural infection ofJE. And half life of HI antibodies in chicks was four days. 8) HI antibodies of JE in the serum of maternal immune-hens and chicken having maternal antibody were located in r-globulin fraction by starch block electrophoresis. 9) The results from 4) to 8) indicate the presence of natural infection ofJE in the <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls.</b> And <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> can be infection source ofJE. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of {{crops and livestock}} animals in Nigeria is not mutually exclusive hence a {{study was conducted to}} determine small-scale crop farmers’ perception of the impact of grazing livestock animals like cattle, goat, sheep and <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> on crop production in Abuja, Nigeria. A multi-stage technique was adopted for sample selection while semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. A total of 384 small-scale crop farmers were randomly interviewed in four agricultural zones-central, eastern, northern and western. Data were analyzed using two-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean separation was done at 5 % probability level. Results revealed that there was significant difference (p a) on crop production was perceived to be serious and it was significantly higher than the impacts of goat (1. 92 b), sheep (1. 78 c) and <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> (1. 28 d). The implication of this is that cattle were the most destructive livestock animals while <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> were the least. At the zonal level, result revealed that the crop farmers in the eastern and western agricultural zones of Abuja felt the impacts of the grazing animals more than crop farmers in the other two zones. Based on the results, the paper recommended that government should map out grazing routes and/or educate and encourage the livestock farmers to adopt intensive system of management to minimize clashes and the damages that occur...|$|R

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Cryptosporidium {{is one of}} the {{important}} pathogenic agents of gastero intestinal tract of mammals, especially human and domestic animals. This parasite {{is one of the}} principal causative agents of mortality in young animals. Considering the zoonotic importance of the parasite, infected animals can be very dangerous to the public health. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in humans, cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> and turkeys in Hamadan and its suburbs and also to evaluate the role of the animals of this area in transmission of the infection to human inhabitants of Hamadan. Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional descriptive study fecal samples were collected from 477 cattle, 220 sheep, 158 horses, 210 dogs, 200 <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls,</b> 200 <b>domestic</b> turkeys and 300 humans in Hamadan city. Cryptosporidium oocysts were concentrated by using the formalin-ether sedimentation method followed by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique and examined by light microcopy. Results: The prevalence rate of the infection in cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls,</b> <b>domestic</b> turkeys and humans was 15. 93 %, 8. 6 %, 12. 6 %, 3. 8 %, 2. 5 %, 4 % and 5. 33 %, respectively. Conclusion: Cryptosporidium can cause diarrhea by itself or with other microbial agents in inhabitants of Hamadan. Considering the high prevalence and intensity of the infection in the cattle of the suburbs of Hamadan and with regard to the results of the other researches in the world and Iran, cattle {{are one of the most}} important sources of the infection for the inhabitants of Hamadan.

Turning to the other kinds of birds, it is to be noted that the studies have chiefly been extended to the birds at least partly domesticated under confinement, such as species of pheasants and ducks, and seldom to species of wild birds, due probably to the difficulty of obtaining materials suitable for cytological studies.

We also sequenced four green junglefowl (Gallus varius), two Lafayette's junglefowl (Gallus lafayettei), and one grey junglefowl (Gallus sonneratii). We then constructed a phylogenetic tree for these birds by the use of nucleotide sequences, choosing the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as an outgroup. We found that a continental population of G. g. gallus was the real matriarchic origin of all the domestic poultries examined in this study. It is also of particular interest that there were no discernible differences among G. gallus subspecies; G. g. bankiva was a notable exception. This was because G. g. spadiceus and a continental population of G. g. gallus formed a single cluster in the phylogenetic tree. G. g. bankiva, on the other hand, was a distinct entity, thus deserving its subspecies status. It implies that a continental population of G. g. gallus sufficed as the monophyletic ancestor of all domestic breeds.

In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1 b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in <b>domestic</b> <b>fowls</b> have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls.
