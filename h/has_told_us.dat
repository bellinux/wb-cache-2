Radcliffe Squires addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: “Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe.

[...] Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches us how to suffer.” ...|$|E

Referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a 1976 letter in which he stated: [...] "The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology.

But I say that we are the enemies of society, and so much the worse for society. We are the enemies of society, for society is the enemy of humanity, its oldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear). Comrade Gregory <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> (apologetically again) {{that we are not}} murderers. There I agree. We are not murderers, we are executioners (cheers)." ...|$|E
