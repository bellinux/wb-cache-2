5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} {{featured}} many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis. Snowball I is mentioned {{for the first}} time and Waylon Smithers can be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> engines.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sound of the group. After about three months, {{he realized that he}} needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E

5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E
25|$|An {{unsubstantiated}} {{claim on the}} Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> village in July 2002. In 2005 the information was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} sound effects {{were used in}} the episodes, and played a major role. In {{addition}} to basic sounds, such as feet walking along a corridor or tunnel, more advanced effects were created, such as the mysterious haunting 'music' which is <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rocket's radio in many episodes of Operation Luna.|$|E

25|$|The {{station has}} played a {{significant}} role in the promotion of hyphy music in the San Francisco Bay Area by playing tunes from many of the local artists associated with hyphy. KMEL's mixshows have long contained exclusive hyphy music which can seldom be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> airwaves elsewhere in the country. Because the station broadcasts live via streaming audio from their website, it gives the genre a platform for possible worldwide exposure.|$|E
25|$|Regular Show has no regular theme music; instead at the {{beginning}} of each episode, a blurred sound (provided by Quintel) followed by a ticking a clock is <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> title cards. The main composer of the series is Mark Mothersbaugh, one of the founding members of the band Devo. As Quintel was developing the pilot he considered asking Mothersbaugh to create the music for the show. The episode's animatic was sent to Mothersbaugh along with a request for him to join the show's staff and crew.|$|E
25|$|During halftime of the 1992 rivalry {{game at the}} University of Georgia, {{the band}} {{executed}} a prank that drew media attention and gained a level of notoriety. As the band took the field for its halftime performance, several band members carried a large tarp with the GT logo painted on it onto the field {{and used it to}} cover the logo painted at midfield commemorating UGA's football program's centennial. The band's performance could not be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> boos that were elicited from the home crowd. Reportedly, the stands remained full during the Georgia Tech band's performance and cleared out when the Redcoat Band took the field, as spectators delayed making trips to the concession stands in order to boo the Tech band's actions.|$|E

25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had a great opportunity to come back when wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but it paid off, as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E
25|$|ELO's debut concert {{took place}} on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the {{recordings}} for the band's second LP and taking Hunt and McDowell with him, left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> electric instruments. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, {{who had been the}} driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Nuremberg Trials {{employed}} four official languages: English, German, French, and Russian. In {{order to}} address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals {{and history of the}} interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.|$|E

25|$|Union Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood's {{division}} {{was ordered to}} march north from Lee and Gordon's Mill around 3 p.m. His brigade under Col. George P. Buell was posted north of the Viniard house while Col. Charles Harker's brigade continued up the LaFayette Road. Harker's brigade arrived {{in the rear of}} Fulton's and McNair's Confederate regiments, firing into their backs. Although the Confederates retreated to the woods east of the road, Harker realized he was isolated and quickly withdrew. At the Viniard house, Buell's men were attacked by part of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's division of Hood's corps. The brigades of Brig. Gens. Jerome B. Robertson and Henry L. Benning pushed southwest toward the Viniard field, pushing back Brig. Gen. William Carlin's brigade (Davis's division) and fiercely struck Buell's brigade, pushing them back behind Wilder's line. Hood's and Johnson's men, pushing strongly forward, approached so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the tiny cabin of Widow Eliza Glenn that the staff officers inside had to shout to make themselves <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sounds of battle. There was a significant risk of a Federal rout {{in this part of the}} line. Wilder's men eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.|$|E

Kneale went on to write feature film screenplays such as Look Back in Anger (1958) and The First Men in the Moon (1964), as well as continuing to write for television, including two further Quatermass serials, until 1997.|$|E
500|$|Pattersons {{crew was}} alert because the destroyer's captain had taken seriously the earlier daytime {{sightings}} of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft, {{and told his}} crew {{to be ready for}} action. At 01:43, Patterson spotted a ship, probably Kinugasa, 5,000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp: [...] "Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!" [...] Patterson increased speed to full, and fired star shells towards the Japanese column. Her captain ordered a torpedo attack, but his order was not <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> noise from the destroyer's guns.|$|E
