50|$|An {{alternative}} view {{of strategic}} communication {{is offered by}} Steve Tatham of the UK Defence Academy. He argues that whilst it is desirable to bound and coordinate communications together - particularly from governments or the military - it should be regarded {{in a much more}} fundamental manner than simply process. The 'informational effect' should be placed at the very <b>epi-centre</b> of command and that all action must be calibrated against that effect - including the evaluation of 2nd and 3rd order effects. This is, he argues, proper Strategic Communication (communication singular - an abstract noun) whilst the actual process of communicating (which include Target Audience Analysis, evaluation of conduits, measurements of effect etc.) - is Strategic Communications (plural).|$|E

50|$|In 1945 the Guild was dispossessed by the Allied forces. The {{building}} was put under marshal ownership and after some essential renovation work the {{building was}} used mostly as a concert hall under different forms of management whilst {{on the ground floor}} a cinema was introduced. Although attempts to establish the Meistersaal as a theatre failed to make an impact, the venue became popular for cabaret performers for example the famous magician Fredo Marvelli. In 1948 the Meistersaal was renamed as Ballhaus City and then later in 1953 as Ballhaus Susi. It continued in this guise until the erecting of the Berlin wall in 1961 which brought about an abrupt end to activities. Its location which once placed it at the <b>epi-centre</b> of a bourgeoning capital city, now left it high and dry, cut off from its public, at the centre only of a political dispute.|$|E

5000|$|The town Kanina, {{came into}} {{existence}} around 700 years ago when a forefather named Kanha came to this place from a village Bhiri Chhapar of Bhiwani district in Haryana. It is hearsay that the present name of Kanina {{was derived from the}} name Kaninwal gotra Kanina is also a Sub Division which houses many Govt Offices for nearby villages. The town has one of the oldest food-grain market in Haryana state. Kanina is also, therefore, famously known as Kanina Mandi. This mandi supplies both 'RABI' and 'KHARIF' crop products all over the country. The population of the town is around 20,000. Kanina Khas is the <b>epi-centre</b> for around 60 villages from Mahendergarh, Bhiwani and Rewari districts. In the month of March (Falgun) on Ekadashi every year, a big Mela is being organised in the name of Sant Baba Moladh Nath. Kanina is also known for its [...] "BRAVERY & COURAGE" [...] in Indian ARMED FORCES. As there is one VEER-CHAKRA and one ASHOK-CHAKRA and one police Medal on its credit along with many other awards. Kanina is moving towards sports excellence too as there was an athlete named Rao Sultan Singh Yadav who represented india in Helnsinki olympics 1952, at present time youth is working towards sports too. A professional bodybuilder named as Kuldeep Singh Yadav is doing extremely good in sports.|$|E

40|$|Open {{ground storey}} {{buildings}} have consistently shown poor performance during past earthquakes across the world. For example during 1999 Turkey, 1999 Taiwan and 2003 Algeria earthquakes, {{a significant number}} of them have collapsed. For instance, the city of Ahmedabad alone has about 25, 000 five-storey buildings and about 1, 500 eleven-storey buildings; majority of them have open ground storey. There are huge numbers of such buildings in urban areas of moderate to severe seismic zones of the country. The collapse of more than a hundred reinforced concrete frame buildings with in Ahmedabad (~ 225 km away from <b>epi-centre)</b> during the 2001 Bhuj earthquake has emphasised that such buildings with open ground storey are extremely vulnerable under earthquake shaking. The presence of walls in upper storeys makes them much stiffer than the open ground storey. Still Multi storey reinforced concrete buildings are continuing to be built in India which has open ground storeys. These buildings are not designed as per the earthquake resistant design. It is imperative to know the behaviour of soft storey building to the seismic load for designing various retrofit strategies. Hence it is important to study and understand the response of such buildings and make such buildings earthquake resistant based on the study to prevent their collapse and to save the loss of life and property. Based on the above an attempt is made in this paper to assess the seismic performance of the soft storey reinforced concrete building by shake table test...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of the breeding biology of Dominican Gulls (Larus dominicanus) in Tasman Bay, Nelson Province, New Zealand. A synopsis of a 10 year (1980 - 91) nest count and banding programme of chicks is given, which illustrates an apparent reduction in pairs nesting over that period. There were significant changes in food resources available to the gulls in 1987 with the closure of several rubbish tips and fish offal dumping sites. These closures did not appear to make any difference to mean clutch size and yet the numbers of gulls breeding continued to drop. In the thesis, I review Lack's hypothesis (1954, 1968) of population regulation and conclude that the hypothesis is unlikely to explain a number of anomalies in the breeding behaviour of local populations of Dominican Gulls. Field work in three relatively small breeding colonies on Rabbit and Bells Islands in the Waimea Inlet near Nelson, is described over two breeding seasons. Sexual dimorphism of adults, pair bonding, and nest site fidelity were studied, together with the recording of egg size and weight, date of laying, clutch size, hatching dates and chick weights. Egg temperature studies were maintained throughout the incubation period. Results indicate that strong pair bonding occurs, and nest site fidelity is developed equally strongly after advantageous sites within the colony have been gained. There is a hierarchy within the nesting colonies with a gradient of increasing breeding success from the outer perimeter of the site toward the <b>epi-centre</b> of the colony. Nest density plays an important part in breeding success and densities in excess of 350 nest/ha initiate a tension factor within nesting colonies, which leads to parasitism and other behaviour inimical to breeding success. It is high nest densities which may eventually lead to colony abandonment. Nesting colonies develop and wane in a cyclic manner with nest densities appearing {{to play an important role}} in the dynamic pattern of the colonies. Incubation appears to start as soon as the first egg is laid, and mean egg temperatures increase as incubation progresses. Embryonic heat generation can control the rate of cooling of eggs and also the rate by which eggs are restored to full incubation temperature after being uncovered by the incubating parent. Eggs can survive temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C and low temperatures of 20 degrees C during the incubation period and still produce healthy chicks. Parental investment in the offspring, is not in terms of clutch size, nor is brood reduction attained primarily by asynchronous hatching. Rather, female parents manipulate egg quality within the clutch, and apportion investment between A, Band C eggs depending on body weight of the female and the circumstance of the nesting colony in terms of its cyclical development. It is concluded that the local populations of Dominican Gulls react in an opportunistic way to the immediate circumstances of the environment, and that factors of experience and learning are likely to influence breeding patterns of behaviour more than the adaptations by natural selection, seen by Lack as those factors which ensure the raising of the greatest number of offspring possible. I conclude that the local population of Dominican Gulls is behaving in a similar way to that hypothesised by Wynne-Edwards (1962), whereby animals attain a homeostatic state and regulate their own population numbers in order not to over-exploit the local food resource. High nest densities, infertility in eggs, and high levels of predation of both eggs and fledglings are the probable factors which have most effect on population density and breeding success, whereas food resources do not appear to have an immediate limiting effect...|$|E
