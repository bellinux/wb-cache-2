40|$|The {{concept of}} a Knitting Heritage Museum arose from a {{perceived}} need to collect, preserve, document <b>and</b> share <b>knitted</b> <b>and</b> <b>crocheted</b> objects, tools, <b>and</b> related study materials. This entity would raise the status of <b>knitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>crochet,</b> <b>and</b> create opportunities for scholarly research and enhanced visibility, as achieved by quilting and other fiber art centers. The author has concluded, after interactions with various museums and textile collections, that <b>knitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>crochet</b> are generally underrepresented. For valid reasons, documentation of objects that do exist is often incomplete or inaccurate and access for both study and exhibit is extremely limited. Although a rich popular literature of techniques, designs and history exists, that information is not frequently accessed by museum professionals. A Knitting Heritage Museum is one means of bridging this gap. This organization would preserve and promote the past, present <b>and</b> future of <b>knitting</b> <b>and</b> crochet; increase access to and the accuracy of its documentation in historic, costume and textiles collections; create {{a home for the}} source materials of leading practitioners and designers, as well as exemplars from the ethnic groups who brought their fiber traditions to America; and foster the continued evolution of <b>knitting</b> <b>and</b> <b>crochet</b> as expressive art forms. This organization may create a digital collection, develop a physical collection -or create a public space for exhibitions, and interaction. Next steps will be explored at a Symposium co-hosted with the Wisconsin Historic Society, November 8 - 10, 2012, in Madison WI...|$|R
