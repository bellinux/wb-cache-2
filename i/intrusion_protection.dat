40|$|SUMMARY The present paper {{describes}} an implementation of an in-trusion detection system (IDS) on an FPGA for 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The system includes an exact string matching circuit for 1, 225 Snort rules {{on a single}} device. A {{number of studies have}} examined string matching circuits for IDS. However, implementing a circuit that processes a large rule set at high throughput is difficult. In a previous study, we proposed a method for generating an NFA-based string matching circuit that has expandability of processing data width and drastically reduced resource requirements. In the present paper, we implement an IDS circuit that processes 1, 225 Snort rules at 10 Gbps with a single Xilinx Virtex-II Pro xc 2 vp- 100 using the NFA-based method. The proposed circuit also provides packet filtering for an <b>intrusion</b> <b>protection</b> system (IPS). In addition, we developed a tool for automatically generating the Verilog HDL source code of the IDS circuit from a Snort rule set. Using the FPGA and the IDS circuit generator, the proposed system is able to update the matching rules corresponding to new intrusions and attacks. We implemented the IDS circuit on an FPGA board and evaluated its accuracy and throughput. As a result, we confirmed in a test that the circuit detects attacks perfectly at the wire speed of 10 Gigabit Ethernet. key words: intrusion detection system, <b>intrusion</b> <b>protection</b> system, exac...|$|E

Methods that rely solely TTPs do not guard against various re-identification methods, which can link apparently anonymous, or pseudonymous, genomic data to named individuals.
