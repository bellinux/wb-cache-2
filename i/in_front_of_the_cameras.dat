5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

500|$|It was {{expensive}} to build large sets, and Milius {{did not want}} to rely on optical effects and matte paintings (painted landscapes).

500|$|Another bill Milk {{concentrated}} on {{was designed to}} solve the number one problem {{according to a recent}} citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the [...] "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him [...] "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.|$|E

2500|$|He {{found that}} one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the {{sponsors}} (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.)</b> To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey's kidding of the commercials and products frequently enhanced the sales of those products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to CBS, accounting for {{a significant percentage of}} their corporate profits. [...] While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors' ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsored, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).|$|E

50|$|Until 1950 {{it was a}} {{practice}} to swear <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord after following a set of rituals.

2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want.

American comedian Jon Stewart commented that the clip showed the moment when Brown's [...] "political career leaves his body". Subsequently, Brown visited her house for 43 minutes in order to apologise in person. Upon emerging, he {{described himself as a}} [...] "penitent sinner", while Duffy refused to speak to the press and would not shake hands with him <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> She said the incident had left her feeling more sad than angry and that she would not be voting for Labour or any other party. The incident was subsequently dubbed as [...] "Bigotgate".|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Singapore {{commissioned}} {{its first}} reclaimed water plant, thus opening a [...] "Third Tap". This was done carefully, after a monitoring period {{of two years}} to ensure safe water quality. There was also an active marketing campaign that included {{the opening of a}} visitor center, the sale of NEWater in bottles and the Prime Minister drinking a bottle of NEWater <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> In 2005 Singapore opened its first seawater desalination plant, the [...] "Fourth Tap". In the meantime it also further expanded its reservoirs, the [...] "First Tap". Today's largest reservoir, the Marina Bay reservoir, was inaugurated in 2008. It is located in the estuary of a river that has been closed off by a barrage to keep the seawater out. Two similar barrages were completed in July 2011, forming the Punggol Reservoir and the Serangoon Reservoir. When the 1961 water agreement with Malaysia ended in August 2011, Singapore could thus afford to let it expire.|$|E

Meldrum made overseas trips and formed friendships with many artists, enabling Countdown to gain international exclusives. His on-screen performances were sometimes criticised for rambling and incomprehensible commentaries or interview questions. When providing an album review he would often hold the album awkwardly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> with lights glaring off its surface {{making it difficult to}} see. In an early [...] "Humdrum" [...] segment, Meldrum told viewers to [...] "Go out and buy it" [...] when reviewing an album. Shrimpton was furious, since ABC policy prohibited direct endorsements, so [...] "do yourself a favour" [...] became Meldrum's standard recommendation. Other catchphrases that he added to the vernacular are [...] "So watch out for that one", [...] "So there you go!" [...] and [...] "A good mate of mine".|$|E

In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series.
