40|$|The {{haemagglutination}} and neuraminidase antigens {{of three}} influenza A isolates from ducks in the Ukraine {{were compared with}} those of a collection of reference strains of influenza A virus. Duck/Ukraine/ 1 / 60 virus contained haemagglutinin related to that of duck/England/ 56 while its neuraminidase was related to that of turkey/Wisconsin/ 68 virus and the human A/Hong Kong/ 1 / 68 virus. Duck/Ukraine/ 2 / 60 and duck/Ukraine/ 1 / 63 were themselves closely related. They contained haemagglutinin antigens unrelated to the six haemagglutinin subtypes previously described for avian influenzaviruses and it is suggested that they should be classified as belonging to <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtype</b> Hav 7. The neuraminidase antigens of these isolates were antigenically related to those of a number of other avian influenza viruses isolated in England, Canada, and Italy and to that of A/equine/ Miami/ 63 virus...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We cannot {{predict when}} an {{influenza}} pandemic will occur or which {{variant of the}} virus will cause it. Little information is currently available on the ability of laboratories to detect and subtype influenza viruses including the avian influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of laboratories to detect and subtype influenza viruses. STUDY DESIGN: In 2006 QCMD distributed an External Quality Assessment panel for the molecular detection and haemagglutinin subtyping of influenza viruses to 87 laboratories in 34 countries Worldwide, which were given 6 weeks to return results. These data were analysed to assess laboratory performance. RESULTS: Influenza virus positive panel samples were correctly identified by 35 - 98 % of laboratories. The correct <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtype</b> was reported by 32 - 87 % of laboratories that detected the virus: incorrect subtyping results included the reporting of avian influenza viruses as human strains and vice versa. Twelve laboratories reported false positives with some avian influenza viruses reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that improvements are needed in the molecular detection of influenza viruses and influenza virus A haemagglutinin subtyping. Only rapid and accurate identification of circulating pandemic influenza virus will ensure that the maximum time is available for intervention. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs) of the H 9 <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtype</b> are endemic in many Asian and Middle-East countries, causing {{mortality and}} morbidity in poultry. Consequently {{there is a}} need for accurate and sensitive detection of Eurasian H 9 subtype viruses. Two H 9 RealTime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) tests, developed by Monne et al. (2008) and Ben Shabat et al. (2010), were originally validated with a limited number of H 9 specimens. In the present study, the two tests have been assessed using 66 diverse H 9 isolates and 139 clinical specimens from six H 9 poultry outbreaks in four geographically disparate Eurasian countries. The Monne et al. (2008) test was modified and successfully detected all H 9 viruses from all three Eurasian H 9 lineages. Bayesian analysis of the clinical specimens' results revealed this test to be more sensitive (97 %) than the Ben Shabat et al. (2010) test (31 %). The latter test detected most H 9 isolates of the G 1 lineage, but no isolates from other H 9 lineages. Mismatches in the primer/probe binding sequences accounted for sensitivity differences between the two H 9 RRT-PCRs. Genetic analysis of 34 sequenced H 9 haemagglutinin genes showed the South Asian and Middle-East H 9 isolates to belong to the H 9 G 1 lineage, and possessed residues that appear to preferably bind alpha 2, 6 -linked sialic acid receptors which indicate a potential for human infection. European H 9 s clustered phylogenetically in a broader geographical group that includes recent North American H 9 wild bird isolates and contemporary Asian viruses in the Y 439 H 9 lineage...|$|E
40|$|Influenza virus caused {{several times}} the global {{concerns}} about the emergence of pandemics, in recent years. The most serious problem, {{in the fight against}} this virus, is its ability to quickly change its unusually antigenic specificity by reassortment and point mutations, especially in surface glycoproteins - haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. In this thesis I focused on point mutations in the hemagglutinin of influenza virus causing change in binding preference, which enables both influenza virus transmission between different hosts and unlimited proliferation in their tissues. The permanent change in amino acid sequence and thus the surface of hemagglutinin also largely prevents the host's immune system to destroy the virus efficiently and quickly enough to recognize when another infection. Each of the <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> has a different amino acid positions affecting its binding preference. Their summary is included in this thesis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} antigenic “drift” in the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens of influenza A virus in vitro under immunological pressure. Variants of the “Asian” influenza strains A/England/ 12 / 64 (H 2 N 2) and A/Tokyo/ 3 / 67 (H 2 N 2) were isolated in the allantois-on-shell system in the presence of homologous postinfection ferret sera. For each of these two viruses three generations of variants were isolated and characterized. It was found that the successive antigenic variants of A/Eng/ 12 / 64 did not resemble A/Tokyo/ 3 / 67. Thus it is probable that the pathway of antigenic drift in vitro was not the same as that which occurred in nature during the evolution of A/Tokyo/ 3 / 67 from A/Eng/ 12 / 64. In addition, A/Tokyo/ 3 / 67, which was the last strain to be prevalent before the A/Hong Kong subtype appeared, underwent significant antigenic drift from “junior” to “senior” variants. This finding did not support the concept that, when antigenic drift occurs, resulting in the appearence of viruses with new <b>haemagglutinin</b> antigen <b>subtypes,</b> the previously prevalent strain has no capacity for further antigenic drift. The study did not result in the production of strains that were identifiable as “bridging” viruses between the H 2 and H 3 <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes.</b> The present paper includes the first report of antigenic variation in the neuraminidase antigens of influenza A viruses occurring in vitro under immunological pressure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Influenza A, {{including}} avian influenza, is a {{major public}} health threat in developed and developing countries. Rapid and accurate detection is {{a key component of}} strategies to contain spread of infection, and the efficient diagnosis of influenza-like-illness is essential to protect health infrastructure {{in the event of a}} major influenza outbreak. Methods We developed a multiplexed PCR (MT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness, including the specific recognition of influenza A <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> H 1, H 3, and H 5. We tested several hundred clinical specimens in two diagnostic reference laboratories and compared the results with standard techniques. Results The sensitivity and specificity of these assays was higher than individual assays based on direct antigen detection and standard PCR against a range of control templates and in several hundred clinical specimens. The MT-PCR assays provided differential diagnoses as well as potentially useful quantitation of virus in clinical samples. Conclusions MT-PCR is a potentially powerful tool for the differential diagnosis of influenza-like illness in the clinical diagnostic laboratory. </p...|$|R

Within a project developing an evidence-based risk assessment framework for influenza viruses in animals, {{we conducted a}} review of the literature for evidence of human infection with animal influenza viruses by diagnostic methods used. The review covering Medline, Embase, SciSearch and CabAbstracts yielded 6, 955 articles, of which we retained 89; for influenza A(H 5 N 1) and A(H 7 N 9), the official case counts of the World Health Organization were used. An additional 30 studies were included by scanning the reference lists. Here, we present the findings for confirmed infections with virological evidence. We found reports of 1, 419 naturally infected human cases, of which 648 were associated with avian influenza virus (AIV) A(H 5 N 1), 375 with other AIV subtypes, and 396 with swine influenza virus (SIV). Human cases naturally infected with AIV spanned <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> H 5, H 6, H 7, H 9 and H 10. SIV cases were associated with endemic SIV of H 1 and H 3 subtype descending from North American and Eurasian SIV lineages and various reassortants thereof. Direct exposure to birds or swine was the most likely source of infection for the cases with available information on exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of existing population immunity against influenza viruses {{is an important}} aspect in pandemic preparedness. Serology methods, such as haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation, are widely {{used for this purpose}} and are also employed in vaccine efficacy studies. Influenza pseudotypes represent safe tools to study the immune response since they are replication-defective viruses and they harbour on their envelope only the haemagglutinin that is the major target of the antibody response. We have generated a panel of Group 2 influenza A pseudotypes and we have employed them as surrogate antigens in neutralisation assays to study sera generated against H 3 N 8, H 4 N 8, H 7 N 1, H 7 N 2, H 7 N 3, H 7 N 7, H 10 N 1, H 14 N 5 and H 15 N 9 Influenza A viruses. Neutralising antibody responses are detectable in the sera not only when they are tested against a homosubtypic pseudotype (e. g. anti-H 4 N 8 sera vs H 4 pseudotype), but also when the sera are tested against pseudotypes harbouring evolutionary related <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> (e. g. anti-H 14 N 5 sera vs H 4 pseudotype). This shows that the pseudotype neutralisation assay detects homosubtypic and heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses and can be used in vaccine efficacy studies and in the {{evaluation of}} population immunity...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{influenza}} A viruses, antigenically {{related to}} the Ho, HI and Hswl subtypes, were isolated from cloacal samples of feral ducks in Canada. Antigenic comparisons showed that these viruses were most closely {{related to the}} recent HswINI isolates from man and pigs, whereas in vivo pathogenicity tests revealed differences between the HswINl viruses from the ducks and those from humans and pigs. Antigenic haracterization f 94 additional influenza A viruses from the ducks showed four <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> (HavI, Hav 4, Hav 5 and Hav 7), an unclas-sified haemagglutinin, and six neuraminidase ubtypes (NI, N 2, Neq 2, Navt, Nav 2 and Nav 5) in various combinations, some of which are novel and have not previously been reported. Three of these duck influenza viruses possessed a haemag-glutinin antigenically related to that of classical fowl plague virus. A much higher percentage ofvirus isolations were from juvenile ducks 08 " 5 %) than from adults (5 %) - All of the ducks, from which viruses were isolated, appeared healthy at the time of sampling. Serological studies on a limited number of humans and domestic birds living in close proximity to the Canadian ducks revealed no evidence of interspecies transmission. Our findings uggest that these birds serve as a substantial reservoir of antigenic-ally diverse influenza viruses, including isolates antigenically related to the current human and animal influenza viruses. This reservoir in nature may be perpetuated by a cycle involving annual infection of juvenile birds followed by transmission to the remaining susceptible birds until the next congregation during the breeding season...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Vietnam, {{serological}} post H 5 N 1 vaccination surveillance {{using the}} HI test {{is applied to}} assess {{the efficiency of the}} vaccination in addition to virological monitoring. In this paper we report on the evaluations of the performances of the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and of a H 5 -ELISA, using chicken and duck field samples. The evaluations were conducted by comparison with a pseudotyped-based virus neutralization test (H 5 pp VNT) performed in a reference laboratory and considered as a "gold standard" and also by using methods developed for imperfect reference test. Their global accuracy and best cut-offs were also estimated. Results from the HI test for several <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> and from a commercial type A influenza competition ELISA were also compared. The results showed that performance of the HI test was very good in comparison with the H 5 pp VNT. Data also clearly supported the cut-off of ≥ 4 log(2) used for the HI test for chickens but, a 3 log(2) positivity cut-off would be more appropriate for ducks. When compared with the VNT, the H 5 -ELISA showed poor specificity when using the positivity cut-off specified by the manufacturer but {{could be used as a}} screening test if confirmed by the HI test or the H 5 ppVNT which presents some interests for large scale testing (no need for biosafety level 3 conditions and high performance). A general and highly sensitive pre-screening can also be achieved using the detection of NP-specific antibodies with a competition ELISA. This appears of little interest in a context of high subtypes diversity where only a subtype is targeted for surveillance and control...|$|R
40|$|Current {{textbooks}} link influenza pandemics to influenza A virus subtypes H 2 (1889 - 91), H 3 (1990), H 1 (1918 - 20), H 2 (1957 - 58) and H 3 (1968), {{a pattern}} suggesting subtype recycling in humans. Since H 1 reappeared in 1977, whatever its origin, some workers feel that H 2 {{is the next}} pandemic candidate. This report reviews the publications on which the concept of influenza A virus subtype recycling is based and concludes that the data are inconsistent with the purported sequence of events. The three influenza pandemics prior to 1957 - 58 were linked with subtypes through retrospective studies of sera from the elderly, or through seroarchaeology. The pandemic seroarchaeological model for subtype H 1 has been validated by the recent recovery of swine virus RNA fragments from persons who died from influenza in 1918. Application of the model to pre-existing H 3 antibody among the elderly links the H 3 subtype to the pandemic of 1889 - 91, not that of 1900 as popularly quoted. Application of the model to pre-existing H 2 antibody among the elderly fails to confirm that this subtype caused a pandemic in the late 1800 's, a finding {{which is consistent with}} age-related excess mortality patterns during the pandemics of 1957 (H 2) and 1968 (H 3). H 2 variants should be included in pandemic planning for a number of reasons, but not because of evidence of recycling. It is not known when the next pandemic will occur or which of the 15 (or more) <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes</b> will be involved.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses {{can cause}} devastating outbreaks in domesticated poultry, with rapid transmission of virus between birds and high mortality. Current measures {{for control of}} influenza involve surveillance, closure of live poultry markets and mass culling. However, despite implementing these measures, outbreaks continue. Considering the uncertainty over whether certain strains of avian influenza viruses will adapt to human transmission and limitations over how their spread may be controlled, this study considers the use of anti-viral peptides as protective agents against low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus. This study investigated the activity and mode of action of two cell-penetrating anti-viral peptide families against influenza A virus infection: ‘FluPep’ (a family of short, hydrophobic peptides related to suppressor of cytokine signaling- 1 proteins) and ‘Entry Blocker’ (derived from the signal sequence of fibroblast growth factor- 4). Plaque reduction assays demonstrated dose-dependent anti-viral activity of both peptide families against a panel of influenza viruses with diverse <b>haemagglutinin</b> <b>subtypes.</b> Determination of IC 50 values showed strain-specific differences in sensitivity to FluPep but not Entry Blocker. The IC 50 of FluPep 4 for A/PR/ 8 / 34 was reduced by reassorting in the HA and NA from a relatively sensitive avian strain using a reverse genetics approach, suggesting inhibitory effects on the viral glycoproteins. Accordingly, viral entry assays focusing on binding, internalisation, fusion and import were designed and optimised to dissect the mechanism(s) of action of the peptides. Results indicated that the peptides acted upstream of nuclear import of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes but did not reduce overall virus binding to cells. However, the peptides caused aggregation of the virus particles {{on the surface of}} the host cells and reduced their internalisation. Further work evaluated how the peptides may be delivered to the site(s) of viral replication in poultry. A screen of the current literature was completed to allow for the design of an expression cassette for poultry-derived Lactobacillus to express FluPep and Entry Blocker. Though the cassette has been reported to be suitable for expression of heterologous proteins in Lactobacilli, rescue of recombinants for expression of anti-viral peptides or a reporter protein proved challenging, possibly owing to toxicity. A stable construct for the expression of FluPep 4 in Lactobacillus was obtained but culture supernatant did not inhibit virus replication...|$|R

To review the relevance to influenza virus nomenclature of new information on the antigenic and molecular characterization of influenza A viruses a meeting was held in Atlanta, GA, USA, in November 1978 under the auspices of WHO.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the pathogenesis of swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 (Thai isolates) in 22 -day-old SPF pigs. Results The study found that all pigs in the infected groups developed typical signs of flu-like symptoms on 1 – 4 days post- infection (dpi). The H 1 N 1 -infected pigs had greater lung lesion scores than those of the H 3 N 2 -infected pigs. Histopathological lesions related to swine influenza-induced lesions consisting of epithelial cells damage, airway plugging and peribronchial and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration were present in both infected groups. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry using nucleoprotein specific monoclonal antibodies revealed positive staining cells in lung sections of both infected groups at 2 and 4 dpi. Virus shedding was detected at 2 dpi from both infected groups as demonstrated by RT-PCR and virus isolation. Conclusion The results demonstrated that both SIV subtypes were able to induce flu-like symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs. However the severity of the diseases with regards to lung lesions both gross and microscopic lesions was greater in the H 1 N 1 -infected pigs. Based on phylogenetic analysis, <b>haemagglutinin</b> gene of <b>subtype</b> H 1 N 1 from Thailand clustered with the classical H 1 SIV sequences and neuraminidase gene clustered with virus of avian origin, whereas, both genes of H 3 N 2 subtype clustered with H 3 N 2 human-like SIV from the 1970 s. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in sequencing technology and computing power {{mean that we}} are in an unprecedented position to analyse large viral sequence datasets using state-of-the-art methods, with the aim of better understanding pathogen evolution and epidemiology. This thesis concerns the evolutionary analysis of rapidly evolving RNA viruses, with a focus on avian influenza and the use of Bayesian methodologies which account for uncertainty in the evolutionary process. As avian influenza viruses present an epidemiological and economic threat on a global scale, knowledge of how they are circulating and evolving is of substantial public health importance. In {{the first part of this}} thesis I consider avian influenza viruses of <b>haemagglutinin</b> (HA) <b>subtype</b> H 7 which, along with H 5, is the only subtype for which highly pathogenic influenza has been found. I conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of available H 7 HA sequences to reveal global evolutionary relationships, which can help to target influenza surveillance in birds and facilitate the early detection of potential pandemic strains. I provide evidence for the continued distinction between American and Eurasian sequences, and suggest that the most likely route for the introduction of highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 avian influenza to North America would be through the smuggling of caged birds. I proceed to apply novel methods to better understand the evolution of avian influenza. Firstly, I use an extension of stochastic mutational mapping methods to estimate the dN/dS ratio of H 7 HA on different neuraminidase (NA) subtype backgrounds. I find dN/dS to be higher on the N 2 NA background than on N 1, N 3 or N 7 NA backgrounds, due to differences in selective pressure. Secondly, I investigate reassortment, which generates novel influenza strains and precedes human influenza pandemics. The rate at which reassortment occurs has been difficult to assess, and I take a novel approach to quantifying reassortment across phylogenies using discrete trait mapping methods. I also use discrete trait mapping to investigate inter-subtype recombination in early HIV- 1 in Kinshasa, the epicentre of the HIV- 1 group M epidemic. In the final section of the thesis, I describe a method whereby epidemiological parameters may be inferred from viral sequence data isolated from different infected individuals in a population. To conclude, I discuss the findings of this thesis in the context of other evolutionary and epidemiological studies, suggest future directions for avian influenza research and highlight scenarios in which the methods described in this thesis might find further application...|$|R
