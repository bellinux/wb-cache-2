5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

40|$|The {{streamwise}} {{development of}} turbulence {{in the free}} convection flow between vertical parallel plates (5 m long and spacing B) was experimentally studied. To control inlet disturbance, a bell-mouth entrance was installed {{at the lower end}} of the vertical parallel plate channel. The turbulence quantity profiles (velocity, intensity, turbulent heat flux and kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>productions)</b> were measured in the vertical channel at heights X (110, 820, 1690, 2630 and 3840 mm) and at spacings B of 50, 100 and 200 mm. The streamwise development of intensity profiles of vertical velocity and the beginning of the transition seem to be closely related to the development of vertical velocity profiles through buoyancy effects. The measured profiles of the turbulent kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>productions</b> and the turbulent heat fluxes seem to clarify the characteristics of turbulence intensity...|$|R

5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E

In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as a waste product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce <b>energy</b> <b>production.</b> When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E
