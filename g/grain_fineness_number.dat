40|$|ABSTRACT: Casting is a age old {{production}} technique wherein cavities are formed by a pattern into a porous and refractive material, usually sand, and then liquid metal is {{poured into the}} cavity so that it takes up {{the shape of the}} cavity, thus forming the required metal product. Various properties of sand such as <b>grain</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>number,</b> green compressive strength, refractive ness, clay content, moisture, mould strength, etc have an appreciable effect over the produced casting [1]. An experimental study was conducted to study the effect of three parameters, namely, moisture content of sand mould, the clay content of sand mixture and <b>grain</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> of sand on the tensile strength of the casting produced. Experiments were planned using the strategy of design of experiments, level and range of input parameters i. e. moisture, clay content and grain size were selected and then experiments were conducted [8, 14]. In each run, the tensile strength of obtained casting was measured using the Universal Testing Machine [12]. Some considerations were put up for the hardness number, visual blow holes, surface finish, pin holes etc. Since we took into account three factors, the use of Taguchi method was made, a total of nine sand mixtures were made for the application of L 9 technique [14].

The sands used were obtained by mixing silica foundry sands with different grain sizes, resulting in different average grain size and fineness number. To achieve the goal, drop tests were carried out making the different sands to slip on a metallic slanted plane equipped with an AE sensor.

In this work, the effect of sand grain size, binder percentage and curing time (each varied in three levels) on the mechanical properties (compression strength, shear strength and core hardness) as well as dimensional changes (shrinkage) of no-bake chemically-bonded molds and cores was studied through lab experiments. Their mechanical properties were found to increase with an increase in binder content and curing time; and decrease with increasing <b>grain</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>number.</b> The shrinkage was found to increase with an increase in all three process parameters. The results are explained in terms of bonding and curing phenomena of binders, and evaporation of solvent. These are also supported by SEM analysis of crosslinked resin bridges between sand grains.

40|$|Natural {{moulding}} sands {{consist of}} refractory sand grains associated with clay right from their deposit locations. In Maiduguri, {{there are some}} sand casting activities taking place. However, {{there seems to be}} no single graded source of moulding sand that the practitioners can use for producing qualitative sand castings. Therefore, this study was carried out to characterise moulding sands from five selected deposits in Maiduguri for possible use in sand casting applications. Chemical compositions of sand samples were determined using XRF Analyser while American Foundrymen’s Society (AFS) standard laboratory tests were used to determine the physico-mechanical properties. The results of the characterisation revealed the following ranges of values; clay content from 21. 8 % to 47. 2 % corresponding to Pompomari and Gwange/Fori, <b>grain</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> from 50. 94 AFS to 95. 02 AFS corresponding to Pompomari and Gwange/Fori deposits [...] Other physico-mechanical properties determined included; green and dry compressive strengths, permeability, loss on ignition and refractoriness. Results of chemical composition analysis show SiO 2 having dominance in all the samples (90. 10 % to 66. 77 %) with trace elements of CaO, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, K 2 O, NaO 2 also present within acceptable limits. The overall results show that all deposits have potential for use in sand casting applications for the casting of nonferrous metals and malleable and ductile iron. However, the clay content range given above is a major problem compared with the standards recommended by the American Foundry Society. This did not only limit their uses to low melting point alloys because of relatively lower refractoriness values but also possesses danger to their life expectancy. In conclusion, the use of the deposits characterised especially the Gwange/Fori deposit with clay content of 47. 2 % should be used with caution because of the possibility of developing gas defects like blowholes and pinholes. All the other four deposits have been recommended for full exploitation for use in sand casting applications for casting of nonferrous metals as well as malleable and ductile irons.

According to several transport and urbanism specialists, economic effects induced by transport infrastructures are not defined by a deterministic relationship. Moreover, the complexity of transport impacts on development leads Plassard, amongst others, to consider the significance of territorial (not only economic) effects. In this context, instead of producing economic predictions, this work proposes a measure of territorial effects of a new transport infrastructure in a forecasting approach. So, {{the aim of this}} research is to build a tool for decision support in planning and transport policy that can show the potential of transport networks to provide the structure of a regional or metropolitan area. This doesn’t mean to replace an economic analysis, but rather to provide further and complementary information to the decision-makers. For instance, french LGV (high-speed train lines) are obviously major tools for development at regional scale. In PACA (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur) region, the project {{can be seen as a}} future backbone to economic and social relations between Aix-Marseille metropolitan area and Côte d’Azur conurbation (around Nice). Nonetheless, within these two City-regions, LGV can be used as another transport service, thereby support local (urban) relations. To assess this double role of LGV, transport service, understood as the set of speed, schedule and <b>fineness</b> (<b>number</b> of train stops) has to be modelled. Modelling approach is based on a transport-oriented GIS using scheduled graph to represent transport service as previously defined. The model uses scheduled accessibility and path capillarity to define territorial effects of a given transport service. Scheduled accessibility gives disaggregated spatiotemporal distance between two places whereas path capillarity represents the fineness of transport service, i. e. potential for small scale use of the transport service. The confrontation of these two indicators can give an idea of the tension between speed and territorial potential. Indeed, a fine metropolitan service will necessarily damage trip speed at regional scale. At the opposite, a looser transport service (removal of a train stop), involves a speed gain...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre linear density on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre linear density for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre linear density may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre <b>fineness</b> decreases, the <b>number</b> of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre linear density is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{bodies of}} revolution, several flight and shape {{parameters}} are considered for investigating {{their effects on}} the sonic boom signature including overpressure and impulse. Here, the parameters include flight altitude, Mach number, cone half-angle, bluntness and <b>fineness</b> ratio. Mach <b>numbers</b> are varied from 1. 41 to 4. 63 due to publicized wind tunnel experimental data for reference. Near-field domain at the flight altitude is modeled by the conservative Euler equations, and the far-field region computations are carried out using the Thomas ray tracing method. According to the parametric analysis, {{it is found that}} sonic boom can be reduced by increasing flight altitude, decreasing cone half-angle, increasing fineness ratio or decreasing Mach number. However, with the increase of bluntness parameter, the overpressure on the ground decreases first and then rises, and the sonic boom impulse shows the similar trend as the overpressure when the Mach number is between 2. 96 and 4. 63, but for Mach number of 1. 41 to 2. 01, the impulse increases near linearly with the increasing of the bluntness parameter...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the way the}} level of the different compositions influenced texture, the way Egyptian blue was processed also had an effect on its texture, in terms of coarseness and <b>fineness.</b> Following a <b>number</b> of experiments, Title et al. concluded that for fine-textured Egyptian blue, two stages were necessary to obtain uniformly interspersed crystals. First, the ingredients are heated, and the result is a coarse-textured product. This is then ground to a fine powder and water is added. The paste is then reshaped and fired again at temperatures ranging between 850 and 950 °C for one hour. These two stages possibly were needed to produce a paste that was fine enough for the production of small objects. Coarse-textured Egyptian blue, though, would not have gone through the second stage. Since it is usually found in the form of slabs (in the dynastic periods) and balls (in the Greco-Roman period), these could have either been awaiting to be processed through a second stage, where they would be ground and finely textured, or they would have been ground for use as a blue pigment.|$|R
