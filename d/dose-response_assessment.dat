"The {{qualitative}} and/or {{quantitative evaluation}} {{of the nature of}} the adverse health effects associated with biological, chemical and physical agents which may be present in food.

[...] In this stage, risk assessors should describe the nature and extent of the adverse health effects known to be associated with the specific hazard. Using toxicity studies and epidemiological data, a dose-response relationship should be established between different levels of exposure to the hazard and the likelihood of different adverse health effects.|$|E
5000|$|Dose-Response Analysis, is {{determining}} {{the relationship between}} dose {{and the type of}} adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (<b>dose-response</b> <b>assessment).</b> The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. mouse, rat) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to genetics or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a no effect concentration. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the [...] "safe" [...] dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.|$|E

30|$|We {{define the}} margin of {{exposure}} as the hazard quotient (HQ), quantified by dividing the exposure potential of NMs concentration in air by the threshold value OEL. The resultant value represents the initial deterministic risk forecast generated by the BN risk assessment model.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of health risk assessment may consist of two main pillars, i. e., the exposure and <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessments.</b> Human exposure to chemicals via multiple pathways {{can be estimated}} by environmental multimedia models, which calculate the distribution of chemicals in the component media, i. e., air, water, soil, plants, and animal media. Combined with the information about human behaviors such as dietary habits, time spent outside, and etc, the multimedia models can provide an estimation of the daily chemical intake by inhalation or ingestion by humans. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are used to estimate the body burden of toxic chemicals throughout the entire human lifespan, integrating {{the evolution of the}} physiology and anatomy from childhood to advanced aged. The use of such PBPK models overcomes the limitations that dose-response modelling holds, e. g., it simply determines the relationship between the dose and the probability of an effect. The European project 2 -FUN (Full-chain and UNcertainty Approaches for Assessing Health Risks in FUture ENvironmental Scenarios) aims at improving the approaches currently used in exposure and <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessments.</b> According to the aim of that project, an environmental multimedia model and a generic PBPK model are coupled as an integrated tool (2 -FUN tool) and built up on a platform system, Ecolego. This study presents here the first application of the integrated tool to perform the full-chain risk assessment of a chemical for human health, considering multiple exposure pathways of chemical via inhalation of out-door air, and ingestion of water and foods. For this application of the tool, a case study was designed based on the information available in a region situated on the Seine river watershed, downstream of the Paris megacity and Benzo(a) pyrene (B(a) P) was selected as a target chemical substance. This study focuses especially on the propagation of uncertainty and inter-individual variability along the modelling chain.

This relation was very nearly exponentially shaped and, therefore, seemed to conflict with the rather slowly rising dose-response relation established in the feeding study.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{views on}} {{the current status of}} (inorganic) arsenic risk assessment in the United States and recommends research needed to set standards for drinking water. The opinions are those of the Arsenic Task Force of the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health, which has met periodically since 1991 to study issues related to arsenic risk assessment and has held workshops and international conferences on arsenic. The topic of this paper is made timely by current scientific interest in exposure to and adverse health effects of arsenic in the United States and passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment of 1996, which has provisions for a research program on arsenic and a schedule mandating the EPA to revise the maximum contaminant level of arsenic in drinking water by the year 2001. Our central premise and recommendations are straightforward: the risk of adverse health effects associated with arsenic in drinking water is unknown for low arsenic concentrations found in the United States, such as at the current interim maximum contaminant level of 50 microg/l and below. Arsenic-related research should be directed at answering that question. New epidemiological studies are needed to provide data for reliable <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessments</b> of arsenic and for skin cancer, bladder cancer, or other endpoints to be used by the EPA for regulation. Further toxicological research, along with the observational data from epidemiology, is needed to determine if the dose-response relationship at low levels is more consistent with the current assumption of low-dose linearity or the existence of a practical threshold. Other recommendations include adding foodborne arsenic to the calculation of total arsenic intake, calculation of total arsenic intake, and encouraging cooperative research within the United States and between the United States and affected countries...|$|R

40|$|Cancer risk {{assessment}} involves {{the steps of}} hazard identi cation, <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessment,</b> exposure assessment, and risk characterization. The rapid advances {{in the use of}} molecular biology approaches has had an impact on all 4 components, but the greatest overall current and future impact will be on the <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessment</b> because this requires an understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, both background and induced by environmenta l agents. In this regard, hazard identi cation is a qualitative assessment and dose-response is a quantitative estimate. Thus, the latter will ultimately require a quantitative assessment of molecular endpoints that are used to describe the dose-response for cancer. It has been possible for many years to quantitate alterations {{at the level of the}} single gene. For example, analysis of mutation frequency by phenotypic selection, analysis of transcription (mRNA) by Northern blot, analysis of translation (proteins) by Western blot, and analysis of kinetics of metabolism from metabolite levels. However, it is becoming clear that it is necessary when considering risk for adverse health outcomes to develop quantitative approaches for whole cell phenotypes or organ effects. For example, cancer is a whole tissue phenotype, not a feature of single gene mutations, in spite of the multistep (multimutation) mode of formation of a tumor. Thus, there is the need to quantitate the circuitry of a cell: the metabolic/biochemical pathways, genetic regulation pathways, and signaling pathways in normal and stressed conditions. The hypothesis presented by Hanahan andWeinberg of the requirement for 6 acquired characteristics for tumor development, independen t of tissue type and species or inducer, seems to provide a viable approach.

The panel also commented on perceived strengths and limitations encountered in applying the guidelines to these specific compounds. This latter aspect of the panel’s activities {{is the focus of}} this perspective. The panel was very enthusiastic about the evolution of these proposed guidelines, which represent a major step forward from earlier EPA guidance on cancer-risk assessment. These new guidelines provide the latitude to consider diverse scientific data and allow considerable flexibility in <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessments,</b> depending on the chemical’s mode of action. They serve as a very useful template for incorporating state-of-the-art science into carcinogen risk assessments. In addition, the new guidelines promote harmonization of methodologies for cancer- and noncancer-risk assessments. While new guidance on the qualitative decisions ensuing from the determination of mode of action is relatively straightforward, the description of the quantitative implementation of various risk-assessment options requires additional development. Specific areas needing clarification include: (1) the decision criteria for judging the adequacy of the weight of evidence for any particular mode of action; (2) the role of mode of action in guiding development of toxicokinetic, biologically based or case-specific models; (3) the manner in which mode of action and other technical considerations provide guidance on margin-of-exposure calculations; (4) the relative roles of the risk manager versus the risk assessor in evaluating the margin of exposure; and (5) the influence of mode of action in harmonizing cancer and noncancer risk assessment methodologies. These points are elaborated as recommendations for improvements to any revisions. In general, the incorporation of examples of quantitative assessments for specific chemicals would strengthen the guidelines.

40|$|The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), in {{collaboration}} with the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) Nutrition and Food Research Institute, is conducting studies to evaluate the role of chemical interactions in the expression of toxicity from low-level exposure to combinations of chemicals. The goal of this collaborative effort is to use a weight-of-evidence (WOE) approach to estimate joint toxicity of some simple chemical mixtures and to compare the estimations with test results from animal toxicity studies. The WOE approach uses individual chemical <b>dose-response</b> <b>assessments</b> and algorithms that incorporate various assumptions regarding potential chemical interactions. Qualitative evaluations were prepared for binary combinations of chemicals for the effect of butyl hydroxyanisole on di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, the effect of stannous chloride on Cd chloride (CdCl 2), and the effect of CdCl 2 on loperamide. Analyses of these evaluations and their comparison with the conclusions of laboratory animal experiments indicate that the WOE approach can be used to estimate qualitatively the joint toxicity of such simple mixtures. To further test the utility of the WOE approach, qualitative and semiquantitative evaluations were prepared for two chemical mixtures [...] one with similarly acting halogenated aliphatics (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene[HCBD], and 1, 1, 2 -trichloro- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene [TCTFP]) and the other with dissimilarly acting nephrotoxic components (mercuric chloride, lysinolalanine, D-limonene, and HCBD). These two sets of data were used to estimate the overall toxicities of the mixtures using the WOE algorithm for the mixture. The comparison {{of the results of the}} estimated toxicity with experimentally determined toxicity of the mixture of similarly acting nephrotoxicants demonstrated that the WOE approach correctly adjusted for the observed interactions in experimental animal studies. However, this was not true for the mixture of dissimilarly acting nephrotoxicants. This could be attributed to the fact that WOE evaluations are based on dose additivity that postulates that all chemicals in a given mixture act in the same way [...] by the same mechanism [...] and differ only in their potencies. In these cases the WOE approach evaluations, based on consideration of common mechanisms for simple chemical mixtures, can lead to better estimates of joint toxicity of chemical mixtures than the default assumption of dose additivity. The results also show that the WOE evaluations should be target-organ specific because none of the models tested could approximate the observed responses in organs other than the target organs in the laboratory animal studies...|$|R
