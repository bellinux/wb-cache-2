5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In United States women <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{the most}} common {{nutritional}} deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are more susceptible to <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> lead to macrocytosis [mean corpuscular volume (MCV)  ≥  100  fL] and microcytosis (MCV <  80  fL), respectively. This study {{evaluated}} anemic status, MCV, serum homocysteine level, and serum {{gastric parietal cell}} antibody (GPCA) {{level in}} oral mucosal disease patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Methods: The blood hemoglobin (Hb), iron, vitamin B 12, folic acid and homocysteine concentrations, MCV, and serum GPCA in 149 patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were measured and compared with the corresponding data in 149 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Results: We found that 54 (36. 2 %), 16 (10. 7 %), 44 (29. 5 %), and 36 (24. 2 %) patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> had Hb deficiency (men 12. 6  μM), and serum GPCA positivity, respectively. Patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> had a significantly higher frequency of Hb deficiency, abnormally elevated blood homocysteine level, and serum GPCA positivity than healthy control subjects (all p values <  0. 001). Of 149 patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> 10 (6. 7 %) had high MCV (≥  100  fL), 108 (72. 5 %) had normal MCV (between 80  fL and 99  fL), and 31 (20. 8 %) had low MCV (< 80  fL). Conclusion: Approximately 73 %, 30 %, and 24 % of patients with both vitamin B 12 and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are found to have normal MCV, abnormally high blood homocysteine level, and serum GPCA positivity, respectively...|$|R

5|$|Iron(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia. Iron(III) sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride {{is used as a}} reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Mild <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> can be {{prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
50|$|There is {{debate about}} whether athletes are at an {{increased}} risk for <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> and whether athletes with low iron, who are not anemic, would benefit from iron supplementation.|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that the prevalence of anaemia in patients scheduled for bariatric surgery is {{higher than in the}} general population and the prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (with or without anaemia) may be higher as well. After surgery, <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and anaemia may occur in a higher percentage of patients, mainly as a consequence of nutrient deficiencies. In addition, perioperative anaemia has been related with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and poorer quality of life after bariatric surgery. The treatment of perioperative anaemia and nutrient deficiencies has been shown to improve patients’ outcomes and quality of life. All patients should undergo an appropriate nutritional evaluation, including selective micronutrient measurements (e. g., iron), before any bariatric surgical procedure. In comparison with purely restrictive procedures, more extensive perioperative nutritional evaluations are required for malabsorptive procedures due to their nutritional consequences. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the current knowledge of nutritional deficits in obese patients and those that commonly appear after bariatric surgery, specifically <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and their consequences. As a result, some recommendations for screening and supplementation are presented...|$|R
500|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{elevated}} lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides). Adults with certain risk factors {{might be more}} susceptible to toxicity; these include calcium and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> old age, disease of organs targeted by lead (e.g. the brain, the kidneys), and possibly genetic susceptibility.|$|R

On September 24, 2009, Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington DC for lightheadedness following an outpatient treatment for <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and was released the following day.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E

50|$|Pica is the craving and {{consumption}} of non-nutrient substances that can cause health risks. Osteophagy in humans {{would be considered a}} form of pica. Unlike calcium and phosphorus in most animals, pica is associated with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in humans. Humans are unlikely to suffer from calcium and phosphorus deficiencies because the minerals are widely abundant in the foods they consume.|$|R
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. Calcium and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH.

50|$|Internationally, anemia {{caused by}} <b>iron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{is the most}} common {{nutritional}} disorder. It is the only significantly prevalent nutritional deficiency disorder in industrialized countries. In poorer areas, anemia is worsened by infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hookworm infestation, and Malaria. In developing countries, about 40% of preschool children and 50% of pregnant women are estimated to be anemic. 20% of maternal deaths can be contributed to anemia. Health consequences of anemia include low pregnancy outcome, impaired cognitive and physical development, increased rate of morbidity, and reduced rate of work in adults.|$|R
5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} remains {{of more than}} 100 individuals have been excavated at Iximche, {{some of which were}} very well preserved. Unfortunately the bones became mixed when warehoused near the site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear. Thirty-six skulls were analysed by archaeologists, of these 25 show evidence of decapitation, a sacrificial practice commonly represented in Maya art from the Classic Period. Thirteen of these sacrifices were male, seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender. Most of the sacrifices were of young adults, ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old, based on skull development. It is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not Kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states. Less than 3% of the analysed skulls showed evidence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia, a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from Copán and Altar de Sacrificios (64% and 88% respectively). This low percentage indicates that these individuals were not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to the elite class. 31% of the skulls had evidence of infection, about half of which were active infections at the time of death, although none were serious. Half of these infections left evidence in the maxillary sinus, this suggests a fairly high level of airborne pathogens in the environment. Tooth enamel analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed hypoplasia in the teeth of 89% of these, indicating a high level of poor health in the first 7 years of childhood.|$|E

25|$|Total {{body iron}} averages {{approximately}} 3.8 g {{in men and}} 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of <b>Iron</b> <b>Deficiency</b> without anemia is called Latent <b>Iron</b> <b>Deficiency</b> (LID) or Iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE).|$|E

Zinc deficiency induced a reduction on the levels of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols. An increase on isobutyl alcohol (fivefold) and a reduction of isoamyl alcohol (two fold) and n-propyl alcohol (three fold) contents resulted from pantotheiiic acid deficiency, whereas pyridoxal deficiency caused an increase on the levels of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols.
