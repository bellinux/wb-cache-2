5|$|In February 2011, King's College London {{students}} founded London's first student-led think tank, the King’s Think Tank (formerly {{known as}} KCL Think Tank). With a membership {{of more than}} 2000, {{it is the largest}} organisation of its kind in Europe. This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other policymakers with their ideas. Every September, <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> peer-reviewed journal of policy recommendations called The Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, {{the main goal}} is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, the area's largest theater company, {{occupies}} a three-stage complex overlooking the Mississippi, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel. The company {{was founded in}} 1963 by Sir Tyrone Guthrie as a prototype alternative to Broadway, and <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of shows throughout the year. Minneapolis purchased and renovated the Orpheum, State, and Pantages Theatres vaudeville and film houses on Hennepin Avenue, which is now used for concerts and plays. A fourth renovated theater, the former Shubert, joined with the Hennepin Center for the Arts to become the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts, {{home to more than}} one dozen performing arts groups. The city is home to Minnesota Fringe Festival, the largest nonjuried performing arts festival in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|When borax {{is added}} to a flame, <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> yellow green color. Borax is not {{used for this purpose}} in {{fireworks}} due to the overwhelming yellow color of sodium. Boric acid is used to color methanol flames a transparent green.|$|E

25|$|The {{image is}} split into blocks of 8×8 pixels, {{and for each}} block, each of the Y, CB, and CR data {{undergoes}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which was developed in 1974 by N. Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao; see Citation 1 in discrete cosine transform. A DCT {{is similar to a}} Fourier transform in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> kind of spatial frequency spectrum.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a disease}} which always makes it first attack on the {{inferior}} part of the scrotum where <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges... in no great length of time it pervades the skin, dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges(sic), hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} location {{is important because}} it affects transportation costs to the refinery. Light crude oil is more desirable than heavy oil since <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> higher yield of gasoline, while sweet oil commands a higher price than sour oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries. Each crude oil has unique molecular characteristics which are revealed by the use of Crude oil assay analysis in petroleum laboratories.|$|E

25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to decode the Masoretic cantillation, but the most successful is that of Suzanne Haïk-Vantoura (1928–2000) in the last quarter of the 20th century. Although some have dismissed Haïk-Vantoura's system, Mitchell has repeatedly defended it, showing that, when applied to the Masoretic cantillation of Psalm 114, <b>it</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> melody recognizable as the tonus peregrinus of church and synagogue. Mitchell includes musical transcriptions of the temple psalmody of Psalms 120–134 in his commentary on the Songs of Ascents.|$|E
