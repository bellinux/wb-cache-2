5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used {{and this is how}} the name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E
