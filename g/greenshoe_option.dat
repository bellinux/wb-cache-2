50|$|The <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> {{is popular}} {{because it is}} one of few SEC-permitted, risk-free means for an {{underwriter}} to stabilize the price of a new issue post-pricing. Issuers will sometimes not include a <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> in a transaction when they have a specific objective for the proceeds of the offering and wish to avoid the possibility of raising more money than planned.|$|E
50|$|Regular <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> is a {{physically}} settled call option {{given to the}} underwriter by the issuer.|$|E
50|$|If {{demand is}} high enough, the book can be oversubscribed. In these cases the <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> is triggered.|$|E
50|$|As with an IPO, the {{investment}} banks who are serving as underwriters of the follow-on offering will often be offered {{the use of}} a <b>greenshoe</b> or over-allotment <b>option</b> by the selling company.|$|R
2500|$|The issuer usually {{allows the}} {{underwriters}} {{an option to}} {{increase the size of}} the offering by up to 15% under certain circumstance known as the <b>greenshoe</b> or overallotment <b>option.</b> This option is always exercised when the offering is considered a [...] "hot" [...] issue, by virtue of being oversubscribed.|$|R
50|$|Investment banking {{operations}} of IDLC commenced in 1999, as Merchant Banking Division {{with the primary}} activity being underwriting of shares. The division managed its first Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2003, by taking Bank Asia public. The company entered into portfolio management business by offering non-discretionary fund management services in 2004 and discretionary fund management services in 2007. It was the first issue manager to exercise <b>Greenshoe</b> dilution <b>option,</b> in IPO of Marico Bangladesh Ltd., a local subsidiary of Marico, in 2009. In 2010, it emerged as the first ever issue manager in Bangladesh to manage IPO under Book Building method by raising equity worth of BDT 1,656 million (USD 23 million) for RAK Ceramics (Bangladesh) Limited, a local subsidiary of RAK Ceramics.|$|R
50|$|If the {{underwriters}} {{are able}} to buy back all of the oversold shares at or below the offering price (to support the stock price), then they would not need to exercise any portion of their <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option.</b> If they {{are able to}} buy back only some of the shares at or below the offer price (because the stock eventually rises higher than the offer price), then the underwriters would exercise a portion of <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> to cover their remaining short position. If the underwriters were not able to buy back any portion of the oversold shares at or below the offering price ("syndicate bid") because the stock immediately rose and stayed up, then they would completely cover their 15% short position by exercising 100% of their <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> is {{a special}} {{provision}} in an IPO prospectus, which allows underwriters to sell investors more shares than originally planned by the issuer. This would normally be done if the demand for a security issue proves higher than expected. A <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> (sometimes green shoe or [...] "green-shoe", but must legally be called an [...] "over-allotment option" [...] in a prospectus) allows underwriters to short sell shares in a registered securities offering at the offering price. The greenshoe can vary in size and is customarily not more than 15% of the original number of shares offered.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> is a {{put option}} {{for a given}} amount of shares (15% of the issued amount, for example) held by the {{underwriter}} [...] "against" [...] the issuer (if a primary offering) or against the majority shareholder/s (if a secondary offering).|$|E
50|$|The {{only option}} the {{underwriting}} syndicate has for closing a naked short position is to purchase {{shares in the}} aftermarket. Unlike shares sold short related to the <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option,</b> the underwriting syndicate risks losing money by engaging in naked short sales. If the offering is popular and the price rises above the original offering price, the syndicate may {{have no choice but}} to close a naked short position by purchasing shares in the aftermarket at a price higher than that for which they had sold the shares. On the other hand, if the price of the offering falls below the original offer price, a naked short position gives the syndicate greater power to exert upward pressure on the issue than the <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> alone, and this position then becomes profitable to the underwriting syndicate.|$|E
5000|$|The SEC {{permits the}} {{underwriters}} {{to engage in}} naked short sales of the offering. The underwriters create a naked short position either by selling short more shares than the amount stated in the <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option,</b> or by selling short shares {{where there is no}} <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option.</b> It is theoretically possible for the underwriters to naked short sell {{a large percentage of the}} offering. The SEC also permits the underwriting syndicate to place stabilizing bids on the stock in the aftermarket. However, underwriters of initial and follow-on offerings in the United States rarely use stabilizing bids to stabilize new issues. Instead, they engage in short selling the offering and purchasing in the aftermarket to stabilize new offerings. [...] "Recently, the SEC staff has learned that in the US, syndicate covering transactions have replaced (in terms of frequency of use) stabilization as a means to support post-offering market prices. Syndicate covering transactions may be preferred by managing underwriters primarily because they are not subject to the price and other conditions that apply to stabilization." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{greenshoe}} (over-allotment) {{option would}} now come into play. The company had initially granted the underwriters {{the option to}} purchase from the company up to 15% more shares than the original offering size at the original offering price. By exercising their <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option,</b> the underwriters are able to close their short position by purchasing shares at the same price for which they short-sold the shares, so the underwriters do not lose money.|$|E
50|$|On 18 September 2014, Alibaba's IPO {{priced at}} US$68, raising US$21.8 {{billion for the}} company and investors. Alibaba was the biggest US IPO in history. On 19 September 2014, Alibaba's shares (BABA) began trading on the NYSE at an opening price of $92.70 at 11:55 am EST. On 22 September 2014, Alibaba's {{underwriters}} announced their confirmation that they had exercised a <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> to sell 15% more shares than originally planned, boosting {{the total amount of}} the IPO to $25 billion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> {{provides}} {{stability and}} liquidity {{to a public}} offering. For example, a company intends to sell one million shares of its stock in a public offering through an investment banking firm (or group of firms, known as the syndicate) which the company has chosen to be the offering's underwriters. Stock offered for public trading {{for the first time}} is called an initial public offering (IPO). Stock that is already trading publicly, when a company is selling more of its non-publicly traded stock, is called a follow-on or secondary offering.|$|E
40|$|The overallotment or <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> {{has become}} very popular in the German IPO market since its {{introduction}} in 1995 and is nowadays an important tool to stabilize IPOs or to issue additional shares {{in the case of}} excess demand. Besides providing evidence for the prevalence of price support activities by the underwriter we show that the <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> which seems to be used to support overpriced offerings in the secondary market is not very effective in propping up aftermarket prices. Additionally, the market seems to decide quite early which firms are ?losers? and which are ?winners? in terms of stock market performance.

40|$|When London {{merchant}} bank, Robert Fleming and Company managed The Wellcome Trust's {{offering of}} shares on the London Stock Market in 1992, {{it did so}} in a very skilful manner. At least one notable feature of this offering was its size [...] the largest fully-paid non-privatisation secondary offering of shares ever to {{take place on the}} London Stock Exchange and internationally. Paul Stonham discusses Fleming's choice of shareoffering technique [...] book-building with over-allocation and a <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option,</b> an innovative technique on the UK domestic equity market. He then charts the month-by-month progress of the deal. From a number of points of view, the offering is considered successful. An attractive price was obtained, a much broader institutional and geographical spread of shareholding was achieved, and the market was efficiently stabilised against the background of a freely-falling stock market. ...|$|E
40|$|In our {{article we}} present {{the use of}} hybrid {{securities}} in the privatization process. We show that exchangeable bonds may be successfully applied during privatization of state companies throughout the world. It may be profitable for many reasons. Firstly, the exchangeables offer a much lower coupon {{in comparison with the}} ordinary government bonds which may be crucial for highly indebted countries. Secondly, throughout the entire maturity period the state remains the owner of the privatized firm which means that the government can be a beneficiary of high dividends paid by the public enterprises and can actively manage them. Thirdly, in the case of unfavorable market conditions the authorities get an opportunity to wait for the end of economic turmoil in order to avoid selling the equity participations under their true value. Finally, the issue of certain types of exchangeables (e. g. callable exchangeables or mandatory exchangeables) and adding several provisions (e. g. <b>greenshoe</b> <b>option</b> or clean-up call) makes the instrument more flexible for the issuer. We also present a few examples of the privatization processes by means of exchangeable bonds i. a. in Germany and in Austria. Most of such operations, e. g. German Deutsche Post, Austrian Telekom Austria or Portuguese Galp Energia SGPS S. A. were completed with success...|$|E
