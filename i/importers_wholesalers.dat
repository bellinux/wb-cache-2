[...] To trace these explosives, the manufacturers, <b>importers,</b> <b>wholesalers,</b> and retail dealers of explosive materials work in tandem with the ATF by providing specific information from their records of manufacture, importation, or sale. Furthermore, due to its unique responsibilities, the ATF is the only federal agency authorized access to these records due to its unique licensing authority.|$|E
40|$|In doing {{business}} with China, poor supply chain performance is reported as being caused by either poor relationships between firms in China or the business environment in which firms in China have to operate. This research paper explores {{the relative importance of}} these two factors for food supply chains from Australia to China. Results are based on surveys of 84 <b>importers,</b> <b>wholesalers</b> and retailers in China and 22 Australian exporters and wholesalers. They show that the country itself had a greater influence than firm to firm relationships. Firms exporting food to China should therefore keep supply chains as short as possible to minimize the uncertainties associated with the business environment...|$|E
30|$|Our results hint {{on several}} aspects of these {{approaches}} that need further attention. First, the evidence that only oil price increase {{and changes in the}} oil price increase are significantly related to the food price is likely to indicate the presence of market power in the Malaysian food markets. Thus, policy attention should be directed to containing market power and, to be more effective, should cover all suppliers (<b>importers,</b> <b>wholesalers</b> and retailers) in the food supply chain. We believe that the recent profiteering and anti-competition acts are a regulatory step in the right direction. As such, enforcement of these acts must be strengthened. Second, although the persistent budget deficit experienced since 1998 has results in rationalization of oil subsidies on several occasions, it must be adopted gradually and together with mechanisms to enhance competition in the domestic food markets and to increase domestically produced food such that there will be minimal impacts on the poor. Finally, the benefits of such existing policy schemes as price controls of essential food items, subsidies and stockpiling are likely to be limited and to work only in the short run unless the issue of market power and agricultural productivity are properly addressed.|$|E

40|$|On July 1, 1993 the European Union (EU) {{adopted a}} unified banana policy {{that is even}} more distortionary and costly {{than some of the}} {{disparate}} national policies it replaced. Before, some EU countries gave preferred market access and high prices to banana producers from selected developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, and from EU territorial suppliers. This preferential status was regarded as a form of aid to countries with historical ties to certain EU countries (France, Great Britain, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Other EU countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) granted no preferences and either had free trade policies or imposed only low tariffs. The earlier quota-based national policies were inefficient because the main benefits of the quotas and high prices were enjoyed by <b>importers,</b> <b>wholesalers,</b> and retailers in the quota-restricted countries. Under the unified EU policy, quotas, high prices, and preferential access provide aid to preferred suppliers, but cost EU consumers dearly and the quota restrictions hurt nonpreferred suppliers (mainly Latin American countries). But the main problem with the new policy is that it extends protection (and consequent inefficiencies) to countries where it didn't exist before. As the costs of the new EU policy become better understood, new forces are emerging that will probably create pressure for change over the next decade. Banana producers who now receive aid through preferential access to the EU banana market are likely to lose those preferences. This could deal a hefty blow to several small Caribbean island economies and some African countries. But much more efficient alternative mechanisms exist through which the European Union could grant aid to these economies. The European Union and the favored Caribbean countries could all gain much by shifting from banana aid to formalized, targeted general development aid.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to examine how retailers play a powerful {{role in shaping the}} governance in cut flower trade in France. Global Value Chain analysis has been used to explain why a distribution system originally based on spot markets has been replaced by tightly integrated supply chains. It allowed an exploration of the consequences of these changes on the structure of the value chain and the inclusion and exclusion of different agents in the chain. Fieldwork were carried out between 2007 and 2008 in France and in Holland with 22 chain participants including supermarkets, franchise florists, traditional florists, <b>importers,</b> <b>wholesalers,</b> institutions and freelance consultants. Traditional florists have always been the main retail channel for cut flowers in France. However, since 1990 `s share of traditional florists has been reduced sharply by entry of new channels and therefore this market became much more consolidated. In the 1990 `s supermarkets began to sale cut flower and rapidly they was accounted 15 % of the market. More recently, the consolidation of market have been reinforced by the emerging of franchises florist chains. French franchises and supermarkets have been bought directly in developing countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Colombia. Each retailer has developed its own value chain control system. The retailer-importer relationship has been moved towards the relational pattern, whereas the importer-producer relationship displayed the characteristics of a captive linkage. These importers acquired new functions, moving beyond a `trading' role toward a more active position in the management of the value chain. They have assumed responsibility for developing new sources of supply, supporting developing-country producers and monitoring their performance. The product and process parameters changed also the roles of producers, forcing them to acquire new technical knowledge of production as well as on close ties with researchers, breeding companies, and importers. Demands for capital and technical capacity had led to the exclusion of many small producers that were unable to meet requirements. This exclusion was initially evident in the France, but then it also has reached all the major African cut flower exporting countries such as Kenya and Uganda. Production has moved away from small growers to large farms, many of which are owned by the Dutch importers. The small producers that have remained in the value chain have been organized into grower organizations {{with a high degree of}} control by the importers...|$|E
