50|$|Though {{interposition}} and nullification are similar, {{there are}} some differences. Nullification {{is an act of}} an individual state, while interposition was conceived as an action that would be undertaken by states acting jointly. Nullification is a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> a state that a federal law is unconstitutional accompanied <b>by</b> a <b>declaration</b> that the law is void and may not be enforced in the state. Interposition also involves a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> a state that a federal law is unconstitutional, but interposition as originally conceived does not result in a <b>declaration</b> <b>by</b> the state that the federal law may not be enforced in the state. Rather, the law would still be enforced. Thus, interposition may be seen as more moderate than nullification.|$|R
