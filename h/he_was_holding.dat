5|$|On 22 December 2007 the Central Electoral Commission {{turned down}} Bukovsky's application, {{on the grounds}} that (1) he had failed to give {{information}} about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents, (2) <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> a British residence permit, and (3) he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years.

5|$|Walter's {{first known}} benefices were a canonry (with prebend) in the Collegiate Church of Abernethy and a prebend in {{the diocese of}} Ross, {{northern}} Scotland, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> by 12 April 1345. None of these benefices, neither parish nor office, are known by name. While Walter would retain his Ross benefice until becoming Bishop of Dunblane, he lost his Abernethy benefice at some point between 20 December 1348 and 28 March 1351. During that period he obtained another unnamed prebend {{in exchange for the}} Abernethy prebend. Walter is only the second known canon of Abernethy Collegiate Church.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} in Wales was deteriorating. Henry had conducted a campaign in South Wales in 1108, pushing out royal {{power in the region}} and colonising the area around Pembroke with Flemings. By 1114, some of the resident Norman lords were under attack, while in Mid-Wales, Owain ap Cadwgan blinded one of the political hostages <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding,</b> and in North Wales Gruffudd ap Cynan threatened the power of the Earl of Chester. Henry sent three armies into Wales that year, with Gilbert Fitz Richard leading a force from the south, Alexander, King of Scotland, pressing from the north and Henry himself advancing into Mid-Wales. Owain and Gruffudd sued for peace, and Henry accepted a political compromise. Henry reinforced the Welsh Marches with his own appointees, strengthening the border territories.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} from SmackDown was the event's final match, in which Batista defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista {{performed}} a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver {{on top of}} the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> and then positioned Undertaker's head {{on top of the}} steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Title. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a chair as he was sitting up.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding.</b> The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache {{communities in}} Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as}} a heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} began mid-July, 1919. At {{the time}} Poland signed a ceasefire in the Polish–Ukrainian War; Lithuania was invaded by the Bermontians {{from the north}} and the Saxon Volunteers were leaving the Lithuanian Army. Piłsudski was planning to use a network of the Polish Military Organization (PMO), an underground organization he created during World War I for diversionary and intelligence operations-like purposes. On July 31, Piłsudski and Polish diplomat Leon Wasilewski arrived at Vilnius, then controlled by Poland. Piłsudski's visit had no clear explanation. He later said that he arrived to negotiate with Lithuanians, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, while Lithuanian historian Vytautas Lesčius suggests <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> talks with pro-Polish estate owners from the Vilnius Region. On August 3, Wasilewski arrived at Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, to negotiate with Prime Minister Mykolas Sleževičius. The Polish mission declared that Poland had no plans to annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future. The Lithuanians replied that the disputed territories were an integral part of Lithuania and rejected the idea of a plebiscite. Negotiations broke down and Wasilewski left Kaunas on August 7. The negotiations were then used to evaluate viability of the coup, the preparedness of the PMO, and the attitude of Lithuanian diplomats towards a union with Poland.|$|E
