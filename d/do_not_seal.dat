50|$|This {{system has}} the {{advantage}} of being able to be tightened mechanically before being sealed. Most threaded systems, such as NPT, have a seal provided by a taper in the thread, so it is difficult to orient both ends of the hose, pipe or tube so that it is not twisted. In the o-ring boss system, this problem is eliminated because the threads <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> the connection and therefore can be rotated at least a full revolution before they are sealed while maintaining a proper mechanical connection. The orientation problem could also be solved with a suitable union.|$|E

[...] The facade of the tower is formed of two parts, the concrete brutalist structure, and wood and glass assembly storefront systems. Many of the original single panes of glass have been replaced, either with double glazing in the existing wood frame, or plexiglass. The overall result is a minimal improvement in thermal performance. Overall the wood facade elements are warped and cracking, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> well.

5000|$|Armadillos are chiefly solitary, {{but this}} species will {{occasionally}} travel in small family groups {{of up to}} three members. They are largely nocturnal, but {{have been known to}} forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gridiron}} valve {{was one of}} {{the first}} forms of expansion valve. The gridiron valve is an arrangement of two plates with overlapping slats. One plate can move so that its slats overlap either the slats of the other plate, or the slots between them, to thus be either open or closed. It has the advantages of a relatively large opening (up to half of the total area) and a rapid opening, needing to be moved by only one slat width to change from fully open to fully closed. Its disadvantage is that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> particularly well. Because of the short actuating distance for a gridiron valve their valve timing would be relatively imprecise if used with an eccentric or similar. Some large steam engines later used them as primary valves, either as exhaust valves for LP cylinders [...] or as inlet valves in conjunction with trip- or cam valve gear.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the value}} of silage saved by {{effectively}} sealing a horizontal silo requires only a few simple calculations, {{but it is still}} a concept that is often overlooked by many livestock producers who store large amounts of silage in that manner.

40|$|A barrier (seal) must form at the cut {{ends of a}} severed axon if a neuron is {{to survive}} and {{eventually}} regenerate.

In contrast, squid giant axons <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal,</b> even though injury-induced vesicles form after axonal transection and accumulate at cut axonal ends. Neither axon seals in Ca 2 +-free salines. The addition of calpain to the bath saline induces the sealing of squid giant axons, whereas the addition of inhibitors of calpain activity inhibits the sealing of crayfish medial giant axons.

40|$|SummaryThe use {{of animal}} samples is {{important}} in otologic research and understanding the anatomy of their ears help make proper use of them in research projects. Aim: to study guinea pig’s and rat’s ears under light microscopy(LM) and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and understand their anatomical advantages in basic otologic research. Materials and methods: The temporal bones, tympanic bullas and cochleas from three albino guinea pigs and rats were photographed and analyzed under LM and SEM. Results: Rats aren’t as simple to handle as guinea pigs, and often present with otitis media. Rats have a fragile junction of the tympanic bulla, two and half turns in the cochlea, and their tympanic membranes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> off the entire external auditory canal. Guinea pigs have full bullas, their incus and malleus are fused and they have three and half cochlear turns. Under SEM, guinea pigs and rats have Tectori Membrane, Raissner’s Membrane and the Organ of Corti. Only guinea pigs have Hensen’s Cells. Conclusion: Guinea pigs were considered easy to handle for microdissection purposes {{because of the size}} and robustness of their temporal bones, and for surgical experiments involving the stapes, the oval window and the tympanic membrane. Under SEM there are similarities guinea pigs and rats, and both can be used in inner ear studies...|$|E

40|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} is a {{very common}} valve problem in horses and most often affects older individuals, but nevertheless existent within younger ones. The root cause for aortic insufficiency can be varied, for example; endocarditis, ventricular septum defect or congenital valve disease but the most common are progressive valve degeneration or elite competition. Depending on the root cause, different changes can be observed on the aorta valves, but they do {{all have the same}} effect, the valves <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> properly and blood leaks backwards.

In the occurrence of the clinical symptoms showing, treatment guideline is to inhibit these symptoms since the valve degeneration is presently irreversible. Most cases show that the horse is put down for humane, economic or practical reasons. Today, there is still no safe treatment. Only a few studies are conducted with live patients within physiology and the treatment for horses. Much of the existing knowledge is extrapolated from human or small animal research.

40|$|For many, {{purchasing}} {{a home is}} the ultimate American dream. But for some, this experience can turn into a nightmare full of unexpected repairs and unforeseen headaches. Although lawmakers have made strides to protect home buyers (e. g.,enacting Illinois 2 ̆ 7 Residential Real Property Disclosure Act), this dream-gone-bad dilemma {{continues to be a}} real concern in Illinois. Still today, many unsuspecting home buyers are saddled with costly defects and deteriorating conditions that were never disclosed by sellers at the time of purchase. For example, in a case of first impression, the Illinois Third District Court, in Kalkman v. Nedved, recently held that a seller is not obligated to disclose defective windows or doors in a home, even if those defects are known to the seller. This Note examines the majority 2 ̆ 7 s decision and argues that the court was incorrect in holding that a seller’s duty to disclose defects in a property’s walls did not also require a seller to disclose defects in windows or doors. Specifically, the court should have focused on the functional definition of the terms in the statute to carry out its purpose, which is to ensure home buyers are protected from unknown conditions that materially affect various functions of the residence. As a result, Kalkman court essentially creates a loophole that permits home sellers to knowingly withhold information about defects in a home—such as leaky windows or doors that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> properly—that could significantly affect its value...|$|E
40|$|Natural analogues of Portland cement {{can provide}} {{insights}} into carbonation processes operating over timescales {{of interest to}} performance assessments of CO 2 storage. Two such sites in Northern Ireland (Scawt Hill and Carneal Plug) have been investigated, where carbonation reactions of naturally-occurring cement minerals can be observed. Here, partially hydrated larnite-rich nodules have been reacting with atmospheric CO 2 or dissolved bicarbonate ions at low temperatures over the last 10 – 20 thousand years. This has produced rims of carbonate minerals around hydrated low-temperature calcium silicate (CSH) minerals enclosing residual cores of primary high-temperature metamorphic calcium silicates and calcium aluminates (dominated by larnite, and often accompanied by wollastonite, spurrite, paraspurrite, brownmillerite, bredigite, andradite-grossular) with carbonation proceeding progressively from the outer margins of the nodules. Calcite and scawtite are the dominant secondary calcium carbonate minerals, but vaterite and aragonite have also formed. The carbonation produces dense, low-porosity carbonate rims. This {{is associated with a}} reduction in volume, accompanied by shrinkage and microfracturing of the underlying residual poorly crystalline CSH gel and its silica-rich alteration product, which has created significant secondary porosity in the altered material. Although some secondary calcium carbonate reaction products may partially mineralise the fractures, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> the fractures completely, allowing further ingress of CO 2 /bicarbonate. That said, the ingress rate has not been sufficient to completely carbonate the nodules, even after several thousand years. Uncertainties remain in terms of quantifying carbonation reaction rates and the CO 2 / HCO 3 -flux, and further work is needed to understand these potentially very useful analogues. ...|$|E

40|$|An enriched {{population}} of cells immunoreactive to antiserum against S- 100 protein, {{a marker of}} folliculo-stellate (FS) cells in the rat pituitary, was obtained by separation of dispersed pituitary cells from adult female rats by gradient sedimentation at unit gravity. The effect of FS cells on the stimulation and inhibition of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) release was studied by coaggregation experiments of the FS cell-{{enriched population}} with respectively a lactotroph-enriched and a somatotroph-enriched population from adult female rats. The FS cell population not only attenuated the stimulation of PRL and GH release, but also significantly attenuated the inhibition of PRL release by 10, 30 or 300 nM dopamine (DA), and the inhibition of GH release by 0. 1 nM somatostatin (SRIF). The stimulatory action of angiotensin II (AII) on PRL secretion {{in the presence of}} DA was also attenuated by the FS cells. Light microscopic evaluation of immunostained semithin sections showed a meshwork of cytoplasmic extensions of FS cells as well as follicular structures in the aggregates. There was no preferential association of FS cells with certain cell types. The permeability of the aggregates to diffusing molecules was tested at the ultrastructural level by the lanthanum hydroxide tracing technique. Lanthanum traced the intercellular gaps over the entire aggregate irrespective of whether the proportional number of FS cells was high or low, indicating that FS cells <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> off certain areas in the aggregate by the formation of tight junctions. It is suggested that FS cells attenuate the action not only of stimulatory but also inhibitory secretagogues on hormone-secreting pituitary cells. The possible physiological relevance of the present findings is supported by the topological distribution of the FS cells in the aggregates, which closely resembles that of the intact pituitary. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic pressure cracking, hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic pressure cracking, a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, hydraulic pressure cracking appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic pressure cracking are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seal</b> water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|E
