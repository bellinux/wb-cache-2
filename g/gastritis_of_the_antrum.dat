40|$|A 2 -year-old male Maremma sheepdog {{presenting}} {{with chronic}} vomiting-regurgitation was examined at the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Camerino University. An oesophagogastroscopy {{with a single}} blue + green (BG) filter restricting wavelengths from 400 to 550 nm was carried out. A conventional white light endoscopy showed a dilated oesophagus with mildly diffuse erythematous mucosa (more accentuated proximal to the cardia); some portions of the gastric mucosa were covered with fluids and appeared only slightly erythematous. A blue green endoscopy highlighted the oesophageal lesions in dark blue, which made them appear more clearly defined from the remaining mucosa. In the gastric antrum, a small, slightly darker blue roundish area was visible. This area {{did not show up}} under the white light endoscopy. A histopathological assessment of biopsy specimens from the distal oesophagus, antrum (including the area highlighted only by BG endoscopy) and gastric body showed chronic-active hyperplastic esophagitis and superficial squamous epithelial dysplasia, while gastric samples showed severe diffuse hyperaemic <b>gastritis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> and superficial diffuse atrophy of the gastric body. The authors believe that the use of a BG endoscopy could be useful in veterinary medicine to increase the diagnostic potential of endoscopic assessment in animals...|$|E
40|$|Chronic (atrophic) {{gastritis}} (AG) {{is common}} in active duodenal (DU) and gastric ulcer (GU) disease. In this case control study in consecutive prospective outpatients (571 cases and 1074 controls) who had undergone diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and routine biopsies from both antral and body mucosa, we calculated the risk of coexisting active DU and/or GU in different <b>gastritis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> or body and according to grade (superficial gastritis, mild, moderate or severe atrophic gastritis). The risk of coexisting active gastroduodenal ulcer (ulcer in duodenum and/or stomach), {{as well as the}} risk of DU or GU, was dependent upon the presence and grade of gastritis in antrum and body mucosa. The risk of coexisting ulcer, as expressed as an age adjusted relative risk (RR) and calculated as odds ratio of gastritis in cases and controls, was significantly increased in the presence of superficial antral and body gastritis (RR = 8. 5 (7. 0 - 20. 0) in men; RR = 5. 8 (3. 3 - 10. 2) in women), as compared with the risk of ulcer in subjects with histologically normal mucosa (RR = 1). The risk of ulcer, and the risk of GU in particular, increased further with increasing severity of antral gastritis. In such patients with moderate or severe atrophic antral gastritis the RR of coexisting ulcer even exceeded 20 in men and 10 in women (RR = 25. 6 (9. 0 - 72. 7) in men; RR = 11. 7 (5. 9 - 23. 0) in women). On the other hand, the RR of ulcer, and the RR of DU in particular, was below 1 in the presence of atrophic gastritis in the gastric body, irrespective of the grade of gastritis in the antrum. We conclude that the type and grade of gastritis strongly predicts the risk of coexisting peptic ulcer, and that the risk of coexisting DU or GU increases with an increase in grade of AG of the antrum but decreases with an increase in grade of AG of the gastric body...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{investigate}} whether the absorbance index of IgG and IgA antibodies against Helicobacter pylori {{is related to}} a semiquantitative assessment of the density of H pylori colonisation in gastric biopsy specimens and to the severity of gastritis. METHODS [...] The grade of gastritis was scored separately for antral and fundic mucosa using three different classifications. Serum IgA and IgG antibodies against H pylori were measured by ELISA. The density of gastric H pylori colonisation was graded semiquantitatively from 0 to 3. RESULTS [...] Among 48 healthy volunteers studied, 17 {{were found to have}} gastritis according to Whitehead's criteria. H pylori was present in the biopsy specimens of 14 of 17 subjects with gastritis. The IgG H pylori antibody absorbance index was significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated not only with the density of antral H pylori colonisation, but also with the degree of <b>gastritis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> as assessed by the Whitehead score, activity, and the Sydney system (p < 0. 05). The IgA H pylori antibody absorbance index was significantly correlated with the Whitehead score and Sydney system, but not with the activity score of the antrum or with the density of antral gastric H pylori infection. There were no significant correlations between the IgG H pylori antibody absorbance index and the gastritis scores of the fundus mucosa and the density of H pylori infection of the gastric body. The IgA H pylori antibody absorbance index was only significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with the density of H pylori colonisation and the Sydney system gastritis score of the corpus. CONCLUSIONS [...] The serological absorbance index of IgG antibodies against H pylori is related to the severity of antral gastritis and the density of antral H pylori colonisation. Thus a high absorbance index of IgG antibodies against H pylori points to severe antral gastritis and dense H pylori colonisation of the antrum...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> host factors {{has been}} {{neglected}} in studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> Helicobacter associated disease. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to assess <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> different mouse strains to infection with a single strain of Helicobacter felis. METHOD: Six strains of inbred mice were infected with the identical H felis culture and were killed at one month, two months, and six months after infection to assess histopathological changes. In addition, two strains of mice were infected with a mouse adapted strain of H pylori and examined at six months after infection. RESULTS: In SJL, C 3 H/He, DBA/ 2, and C 57 BL/ 6 infected mice, severe to moderate chronic active gastritis was observed only in <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach, which increased in severity over time with specialised cells in the body glands being replaced. As <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> this damage in the body increased and atrophic changes were seen, <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> bacterial colonisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> decreased. In contrast, in BALB/c and CBA mice, there was only mild gastritis in <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> no remarkable changes were detected in their body mucosa, and no atrophy was seen over time. In both these strains of mice, heavy bacterial colonisation was seen, which tended to increase over <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment. <b>Of</b> particular importance in this experiment was that bacterial colonisation was mainly restricted to <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> yet <b>the</b> atrophy, when present, was only observed in <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach. H pylori infected C 3 H/He mice showed moderate colonisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> which persisted up to six months with little development of atrophy. In contrast, H pylori in C 57 BL/ 6 mice showed excellent colonisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> at two months but six months after infection there was moderate to severe body atrophy, which was associated with a loss <b>of</b> bacteria from <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge current concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> Helicobacter induced atrophy in that active chronic <b>gastritis</b> <b>of</b> <b>antrum</b> or <b>the</b> body mucosa, or both, is not a prerequisite. They also suggest an autoimmune basis for the pathology although no autoantibody or antibody to the H+/K+ ATPase was detected.

40|$|Gastrin-secreting enteroendocrine cells (G cells) in <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> play an {{important}} role in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> gastric secretion, gastric motility and mucosal cell proliferation. Recently we have uncovered <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two subpopulations of G cells with pivotally different morphology and a distinct localization in the antral invaginations; <b>the</b> functional implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different G cell types are still elusive. In this study a transgenic mouse line in which EGFP is expressed under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> a gastrin promoter was used to elucidate <b>the</b> distribution pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two G cell types throughout <b>the</b> different regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> immunohistochemical analyses revealed that G cells were not equally distributed along <b>the</b> anterior/posterior axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> <b>The</b> “typical” pyramidal- or roundish-shaped G cells, which are located in <b>the</b> basal region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antral invaginations, were more abundant in <b>the</b> proximal <b>antrum</b> bordering <b>the</b> corpus region but less frequent in <b>the</b> distal <b>antrum</b> bordering <b>the</b> pylorus.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{frequency}} and type of p 53 alterations (gene mutation and/or protein overexpression) in a consecutive series of surgically resected adenocarcinomas arising in the gastric cardia and gastric antrum, and to evaluate associations with clinicopathological findings (age, sex, and tumour histology, grade, and stage). METHODS: The series comprised 50 patients with adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia and 20 patients with adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> p 53 gene mutations (exons 5 - 8) were detected by denaturing gradient gel analysis and DNA sequencing. Nuclear p 53 overexpression was detected by immunohistochemistry with the DO 7 antibody. RESULTS: p 53 gene mutations were found in 21 of 50 and five of 20 adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia and <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> respectively. Base transitions occurring at CpG dinucleotides were frequent in both types of tumour. p 53 protein overexpression was seen in 32 of 50 and seven of 20 adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> respectively. p 53 gene mutation and/or protein overexpression were significantly more frequent in adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia (37 <b>of</b> 50) than in adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> (seven <b>of</b> 20).

Methods. The material comprised 66 surgical specimens; 10 were Barrett’s carcinomas, 25 adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastric cardia (type II adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> esophagogastric junction - EGJ), and 31 adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> Immunostaining for p 53 protein was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, using the alkaline phosphatase - antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. The cases were considered positive for p 53 if at least 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumor cells expressed this protein by immunostaining. Results. There was no significant difference observed between the studied groups in regards to age, sex, Lauren’s classification and tumor differentiation. There was, however, a significant difference observed in <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> tumor invasion between Barrrett’s adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia compared with <b>the</b> adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> Namely, at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> surgery, both Barrett’s adenocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia, were significantly more advanced comparing with <b>the</b> adenocarcinomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> Overexpression <b>of</b> p 53 was found in 40 % (4 / 10) of Barrett’s adenocarcinomas, 72 % (18 / 25) <b>of</b> adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cardia and 65 % (20 / 31) <b>of</b> adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> No significant differences in p 53 expression in relation to sex, type (Lauren) of tumor, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement, or tumor differentiation were observed in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analyzed groups <b>of</b> tumors.

METHODS: The investigation involved 117 {{patients with a}} cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach invading the serosa (pT 3) who underwent R 0 resection with at least D 2 lymphadenectomy between 1988 and 1998 at three different Italian centers. <b>The</b> choice <b>of</b> surgical procedure (40 total gastrectomies and 77 subtotal gastrectomies) was based on <b>the</b> preference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surgeon; none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients underwent splenectomy. The Cox regression model {{was used to evaluate}} <b>the</b> prognostic significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> surgery (subtotal versus total gastrectomy), controlling for age, sex, histology, nodal involvement, and surgical center. RESULTS: The morbidity and mortality rates did not vary significantly according to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> surgery. Patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy presented a better disease-related survival than patients undergoing total gastrectomy (P = 0. 011) : the median survival times were, respectively, 38 months and 23 months, and the overall cumulative 5 -year survival rates (95 % confidence intervals [CI]) were, respectively, 36 % (22 %- 50 %) and 22 % (11 %- 37 %). On univariate analysis, the relative risk (RR) of disease-related death was 1. 84 (1. 14 - 2. 97) after total gastrectomy, with respect to subtotal gastrectomy. This difference was blunted on multivariate analysis (RR, 1. 66; 0. 99 - 2. 78) : in the final model, only nodal metastasis was a significant prognostic factor, while type of surgery had a borderline significance (P = 0. 057). CONCLUSIONS: Survival after subtotal gastrectomy is not lower than that after total gastrectomy in patients with tumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> invading <b>the</b> serosa. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> subtotal or total gastrectomy in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> advanced gastric cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> with serosal invasion was investigated...|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of rhynchodemid flatworm, Othelosoma nyanga, is {{described}} from Rhodes Nyanga National Park in <b>the</b> eastern highlands <b>of</b> Zimbabwe. Live flatworms are yellow, with a faint dark central line dorsally and appear cylindrical in photographs. They were found under dead wood stumps in grassland. Preserved worms are cylindrical, and up to 22 mm long and 2. 5 mm wide. A dorsal anterior retractor muscle causes the head to be strongly retracted in preserved specimens. Ventrally, there is a narrow, ciliated creeping sole. There is well-developed parenchymal longitudinal musculature. Ovaries are anterior. The two ovovitelline ducts fuse posterior to the gonopore and form two further ducts. One short duct runs anteriorly and opens into <b>the</b> common <b>antrum,</b> above <b>the</b> gonopore.

40|$|A giant gastric angiodysplasia causing {{recurrent}} {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} {{was found in}} a 51 -year-old woman who had been treated with repeated blood transfusions for severe anemia. At first, no active bleeding source was seen on upper or lower GI endoscopy. The only abnormality found on gastroendoscopy was an irregular, flat, reddish mucosal lesion on <b>the</b> posterior wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum,</b> which was mistaken for superficial gastritis. Subsequent endoscopic examinations were done because of intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding and revealed a 4 x 6 cm, irregular, mildly elevated, bright-red vascular lesion on <b>the</b> posterior wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> This giant lesion had spontaneous oozing of fresh blood and was suspected to be a gastric angiodysplasia.

40|$|Abstract Background Hyperplastic polyps are {{the most}} common polypoid lesions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stomach. Rarely, they cause gastric outlet {{obstruction}} by prolapsing through the pyloric channel, when they arise in <b>the</b> prepyloric <b>antrum.</b> Case presentation A 62 -year-old woman presented with intermittent nausea and vomiting of 4 months duration. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 30 mm prepyloric sessile polyp causing intermittent gastric outlet obstruction. Following submucosal injection of diluted adrenaline solution, the polyp was removed with a snare. Multiple biopsies were taken from <b>the</b> greater curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> and <b>the</b> corpus. Rapid urease test for Helicobacter pylori yielded a negative result. Histopathologic examination showed a hyperplastic polyp without any evidence of malignancy. Biopsies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> and <b>the</b> corpus revealed gastritis with neither atrophic changes nor Helicobacter pylori infection. Follow-up endoscopy after a 12 -week course of proton pomp inhibitor therapy showed a complete healing without any remnant tissue at the polypectomy site. The patient has been symptom-free during 8 months of follow-up. Conclusions Symptomatic gastric polyps should be removed preferentially when they are detected at the initial diagnostic endoscopy. Polypectomy not only provides tissue to determine the exact histopathologic type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polyp, but also achieves radical treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAquaporins (AQPs) are a well-conserved {{family of}} small (approximately 30  kDa) {{membrane}} channel proteins that facilitate rapid movement of fluids {{and have a}} unique tissue-specific pattern of expression. These proteins {{have been found in}} the female reproductive systems of humans, rats, and mice. However, the expression and cellular localization of AQPs have not extensively been studied in the female reproductive system of sheep. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate, by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry respectively, <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> messenger RNA and <b>the</b> immunolocalization <b>of</b> AQP 3, AQP 7, and AQP 9 in large isolated ovine secondary follicles over a period of IVC. Our analysis revealed that AQP 3 and AQP 9 were present predominately in follicles that exhibited antrum formation, suggesting a crucial role of these AQPs in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum.</b> Interestingly, AQP 7 was only expressed in follicles that had not formed an antrum by Day 12 of culture. In conclusion, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> protein channels (AQP 3 and AQP 9) seems to be essential for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>antrum</b> in isolated ovine secondary follicles cultured in vitro and thus plays an important role during folliculogenesis in this species...|$|R
