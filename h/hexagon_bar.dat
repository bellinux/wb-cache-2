5000|$|On June 6 {{he called}} to say {{newspaper}} accounts {{of some of the}} murders were inaccurate. His next call came June 11. In a whimpering, barely coherent voice he cried: [...] "I’m sorry for what I did to Compton." [...] His next victim was Kathleen Greening, also in St. Paul. Stephani later confessed to drowning her in her bathtub at her Roseville, MN residence. His fourth victim (and the last victim who he killed) was Barbara Simons, a 40-year-old nurse on the Minneapolis side of the river. The two met at the <b>Hexagon</b> <b>bar,</b> after Simons gave Stephani an extra cigarette. After spending the night at the bar with Stephani, Simons told a waitress, [...] "He's cute, I hope he's nice, since he's giving me a ride home." [...] Simons was found stabbed to death the next day. There were no calls after Greening’s death, but the [...] "Weepy-Voice Killer" [...] contacted police on the murder of Simons: [...] "Please don’t talk, just listen... I’m sorry I killed that girl. I stabbed her 40 times. Kimberly Compton was the first one over in St. Paul." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{mechanism}} of graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on a catalyst surface, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of carbon atom self-assembly on a Ni(111) surface based on a well-designed empirical reactive bond order potential was performed. We simulated single layer graphene with recorded size (up to 300 atoms per super-cell) and reasonably good quality by MD trajectories up to 15 ns. Detailed processes of graphene CVD growth, such as carbon atom dissolution and precipitation, formation of carbon chains of various lengths, polygons and small graphene domains were observed during the initial process of the MD simulation. The atomistic processes of typical defect healing, such as the transformation from a pentagon into a hexagon and from a pentagon-heptagon pair (5 vertical bar 7) to two adjacent <b>hexagons</b> (6 vertical <b>bar</b> 6), were revealed as well. The study also showed that higher temperature and longer annealing time are essential to form high quality graphene layers, which is in agreement with experimental reports and previous theoretical results. ope...|$|R
