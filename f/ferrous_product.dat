40|$|The {{application}} of austempered ductile iron (ADI) is gaining an ever {{greater share of}} the worldwide <b>ferrous</b> <b>product</b> market, specifically centering on the aerospace, automotive and shipping industries. ADI is a heat treated cast iron, which exhibits remarkable mechanical properties and provides an attractive material for designers and engineers to displace conventional materials. Previous attempts, however, to machine ADI using carbide or ceramic cutting tools produced poor tool life characteristics due to the relatively poor machinability of the workpiece. This paper presents a research study that has applied the advanced technology of modern ultrahard cutting tools, {{in an attempt to}} achieve enhanced machinability performance. This performance was evaluated through the analysis of cutting forces, tool wear, surface finish and roundness...|$|E
40|$|Iron isotope {{fractionation}} between aqueous Fe(II) and biogenic magnetite and Fe carbonates produced during reduction of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) by Shewanella putrefaciens, Shewanella algae, and Geobacter sulfurreducens in laboratory experiments {{is a function}} of Fe(III) reduction rates and pathways by which biogenic minerals are formed. High Fe(III) reduction rates produced 56 Fe/ 54 Fe ratios for Fe(II) aq that are 2 - 3 per mil lower than the HFO substrate, reflecting a kinetic {{isotope fractionation}} that was associated with rapid sorption of Fe(II) to HFO. In long-term experiments at low Fe(III) reduction rates, the Fe(II) aq-magnetite fractionation is- 1. 3 per mil, and this is interpreted to be the equilibrium fractionation factor at 22 oC in the biological reduction systems studied here. In experiments where Fe carbonate was the major <b>ferrous</b> <b>product</b> of HF...|$|E
40|$|Iron is an oxidant {{as well as}} a {{nutrient}} for invading microbial and neoplastic cells. Excessive iron {{in specific}} tissues and cells (iron loading) promotes development of infection, neoplasia, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy, and various endocrine and possibly neurodegenerative disorders. To contain and detoxify the metal, hosts have evolved an iron withholding defense system, but the system can be compromised by numerous factors. An array of behavioral, medical, and immunologic methods are in place or in development to strengthen iron withholding. Routine screening for iron loading could provide valuable information in epidemiologic, diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic studies of emerging infectious diseases. Excessive iron in specific tissues (iron loading) promotes infection, neoplasia, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy, and a profusion of endocrine and possibly neurodegenerative disorders (1 - 5). An array of behavioral, medical, and immunologic methods are being developed to decrease iron loading or its detrimental effects. Routine screening for iron loading in populations exposed to certain diseases can provide valuable epidemiologic, diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic information. Hazards of Iron Loading Iron can contribute to disease development in several ways. Excessive amounts of the metal in specific tissues and cells can hinder the ability of proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin, to prevent accretion of free iron. Moreover, in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, and illnesses that involve ischemia and reperfusion, iron causes reactions that produce superoxide radicals (6). Nonprotein bound ferric ions are reduced by superoxide, and the <b>ferrous</b> <b>product</b> is reoxidized by peroxide to regenerate ferric ions and yield hydroxyl radicals, which attack all classes of biologic macromolecules. Hydroxyl radicals can depolymerize polysaccharides, cause DNA strand breaks, inactivate enzymes, and initiate lipid peroxidation (6). Iron can also increase disease risk by functioning as a readily available essential nutrient for invading microbial and neoplastic cells. To survive and replicate in hosts, microbia...|$|E

40|$|Background: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA) {{is frequently}} seen in inflammatory bowel disease. Traditionally, oral iron supplementation {{is linked to}} extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. This multicenter phase- 3 study tested the efficacy and safety of ferric maltol, a complex of ferric (Fe 3 +) iron with maltol (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 -pyrone), as a novel oral iron therapy for IDA. Methods: Adult patients with quiescent or mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, mild-to-moderate IDA (9. 5 – 12. 0 g/dL and 9. 5 – 13. 0 g/dL in females and males, respectively), and documented failure on previous oral <b>ferrous</b> <b>products</b> received oral ferric maltol capsules (30 mg twice a day) or identical placebo for 12 weeks according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to week 12. Safety and tolerability were assessed. Results: Of 329 patients screened, 128 received randomized therapy (64 ferric maltol-treated and 64 placebo-treated patients) and comprised the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis: 55 ferric maltol patients (86 %) and 53 placebo patients (83 %) completed the trial. Significant improvements in Hb were observed with ferric maltol versus placebo at weeks 4, 8, and 12 : mean (SE) 1. 04 (0. 11) g/dL, 1. 76 (0. 15) g/dL, and 2. 25 (0. 19) g/dL, respectively (P, 0. 0001 at all time-points; analysis of covariance).

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Transactions of the Institute of Metal Finishing [© W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] zinc finishes have been associated with the electronics industry for many years {{as a result of their}} excellent corrosion resistance and relatively low cost. They are normally applied onto <b>ferrous</b> <b>products</b> to provide corrosion protection in a range of different environments. However, the formation of spontaneously grown whiskers on zinc-electroplated components, which are capable of resulting in electrical shorting or other damaging effects, can be highly problematic for the reliability of long life electrical and electronic equipment. The growth of zinc whiskers has been identified as the cause of some electrical and electronic failures in telecommunications and aerospace-based applications, with consequences ranging from mild inconvenience to complete system failures. Investigators have been striving to address the problems induced by whisker growth since 1940 s. However, most research effort has been focused on tin whiskers, especially following European Union environmental legislation that restricted the use of lead (Pb), which when alloyed with tin (3 – 10 % by weight) provided effective tin whisker mitigation. Compared with tin whisker research, much less attention has been paid to zinc whiskers. A number of mechanisms to explain zinc whisker growth have been proposed, but none of them are widely accepted and some are in conflict with each other. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature in regard to zinc whiskers, to discuss the reported growth mechanisms, to evaluate the effect of deposition parameters and to explore potential mitigation methods. This paper presents a chronologically ordered review of zinc whisker-related studies from 1946 to 2013.

40|$|The {{requirement}} for a reduction step in cellular iron uptake has been postulated, {{and the existence}} of plasma membrane ferric reductase activity has been described in both procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is an externally directed reductase activity that is regulated by the concentration of iron in the growth medium; maximal activity is induced by iron starvation. We report here the isolation of a mutant of S. cerevisiae lacking the reductase activity. This mutant is deficient in the uptake of ferric iron and is extremely sensitive to iron deprivation. Genetic analysis of the mutant demonstrates that the reductase and ferric uptake deficiencies are due to a single mutation that we designate fre 1 - 1. Both phenotypes cosegregate in meiosis, corevert with a frequency of 10 (- 7), and are complemented by a 3. 5 -kilobase fragment of genomic DNA from wild-type S. cerevisiae. This fragment contains FRE 1, the wild-type allele of the mutant gene. The level of the gene transcript is regulated by iron in the same was as the reductase activity. The <b>ferrous</b> ion <b>product</b> of the reductase must traverse the plasma membrane. A high-affinity (Km = 5 microM) ferrous uptake system is present in both wild-type and mutant cells. Thus, iron uptake in S. cerevisiae is mediated by two plasma membrane components, a reductase and a ferrous transport system...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of separating actinides (uranium and plutonium) from fission products (FP) were conducted using a modified Plutonium Uranium Recovery by Extraction (PUREX) process. The sample under investigation was a low-burn-up (< 5 GWd/tHM), depleted uranium dioxide (DUO 2) sample (~ 13 mg) irradiated in a fast neutron spectrum in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The {{objective of the}} study was to quantify the fission product decontamination factor for PUREX process steps while separating and purifying plutonium. Aliquots of the dissolved neutron-irradiated DUO 2 sample containing FPs and near weapons-grade plutonium (~ 89 % 239 Pu), underwent three modified PUREX decontamination cycles with products (organic and aqueous solutions) from each process step being analyzed via high-resolution gamma spectroscopy. The purification cycle consisted of tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TBP) and kerosene contacted with the feed solution aliquot to extract actinides (plutonium and uranium primarily) from feed to organic phase and further actinide (plutonium only) back-extraction using <b>ferrous</b> sulfamate. Fission <b>product</b> elements, cesium (by measuring 137 Cs) and cerium (by measuring 144 Ce) were determined to be the most readily removed elements from the product stream when analyzing a whole plutonium purification cycle.
