2500|$|In 1981, she {{starred in}} Second-Hand Hearts for esteemed {{director}} Hal Ashby as [...] "Dinette Dusty", a recently widowed waitress and would-be singer who marries a boozy carwash worker named [...] "Loyal", played by Robert Blake {{to get back}} her children from their paternal grandparents. The film, based on a highly sought-after [...] "road movie" [...] screenplay by Charles Eastman, was a disaster that tarnished the careers of all concerned. Critic Vincent Canby in his negative New York Times review on May 8, 1981 opined, [...] "he film's one bright spot is Barbara Harris, who plays <b>Dinette</b> as sincerely as possible under awful conditions. She looks great even when she's supposed to be tacky, and is genuinely funny {{as she tries to}} make sense out of Loyal's muddled philosophizing, which, of course, the screenplay requires her to match." [...] Harris was offscreen until 1986 when she played the mother of Kathleen Turner in Peggy Sue Got Married. Her last films were Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Grosse Pointe Blank.|$|E
