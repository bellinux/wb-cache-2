40|$|Rat medial {{gastrocnemius}} (MG) {{muscle is}} a compartmentalized muscle: two extramuscular nerve branches innervate proximal or distal compartments. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate adaptive responses of different compartments on the rat MG muscle in the early phase of skeletal muscle atrophy caused by one-week cast-immobilization. Cross sectional area (CSA) of <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> fiber in individual compartments were determined. CSA of <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> fiber in both compartments were decreased by cast-immobilization. CSA of type IIa and IId fibers in the proximal compartment were more atrophied in the distal compartment. These results suggested that the degree of atrophy for <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> muscle fiber between different compartments was not similar in the early phase of atrophy caused by cast-immobilization...|$|R

Cross-sectional areas (CSA) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activities of <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> fiber in individual regions were determined after 8 weeks endurance training. CSA of <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> fiber in both regions were increased by endurance training. However the CSA of fibers in distal region were greater than in proximal region of trained muscle. SDH activities of <b>each</b> <b>typed</b> fiber were increased by the training, but that of type. I fiber was not increased in the distal region. These results indicate that recruitment of motor units is dependent on the compartment region and that the adaptive responses of different regions in the plantaris muscle are not uniform...|$|R

5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies used}} by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants {{are not easily}} found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal growth patterns.

Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. <b>Each</b> <b>type</b> of defense can be either constitutive (always present in the plant), or induced (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores).|$|E

40|$|Note: {{appendices}} {{for this}} title available. This thesis proposes a multi-objective, mixed integer, non-linear programming model of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS) design {{to maximize the}} system reliability and minimize the total system cost simultaneously. The model involves multiple machine types, multiple machines for <b>each</b> machine <b>type,</b> multiple part types, and alternative process routes for <b>each</b> part <b>type.</b> <b>Each</b> process route consists of a sequence of operations. System reliability associated with machines along process routes can be improved by {{increasing the number of}} parallel machines subject to acceptable cost. Assuming machine reliability to follow a lognormal distribution, the CMS design problem is to optimally decide the number of <b>each</b> machine <b>type,</b> assign machines to cells, and select, for <b>each</b> part <b>type,</b> the process route with the highest overall system reliability while minimizing the total cost. Genetic algorithm is applied to solve this practical-sized CMS design problem. It finds a heuristic solution within a reasonable computational time...|$|R

The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and <b>each</b> <b>type</b> of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
