500|$|In January 1972, Popular Electronics {{changed its}} {{editorial}} focus {{in an attempt}} to attract more advertising revenues. Reviews of stereo equipment and citizens band radio were featured; experimenter and constructions projects were gone. Dan Meyer, Don Lancaster, Forrest Mims, John Simonton and many other authors immediately started contributing to the competing Radio-Electronics magazine. The June 1972 cover story was [...] "Experimenting with a $32 Solid State Laser" [...] by Forrest Mims. Another article in that issue was [...] "Experiments with Op-Amps" [...] by B.R. Rogen; this was a pseudonym of Popular Electronics technical editor, Les Solomon. Solomon wrote articles for Radio-Electronics while working for Popular Electronics. Lou Garner, the longtime solid-state editor, moved to Radio-Electronics for a year. Several MITS kit projects were featured in Radio-Electronics including the ITC 1800 Integrated Circuit Tester (May 1972), the Model 1700 <b>Function</b> <b>Generator</b> (July 1973), the Model 1440 Calculator (July 1973) and the 88 VLCT Computer Terminal (November 1974).|$|E

If Ei is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector's output will be square.

It {{has been shown that}} using an orthogonal Boolean <b>functions</b> system <b>generator</b> which is key-reconfigured allows decreasing the collision probability and increasing the effectiveness of probing and of hash-memory utilization. Key-generated hash-functions can be useful for data security in hash-memory. The hash-memory structure is designed based on hash-functions key-reconfigured generator. The implementation of the proposed <b>functions</b> <b>generator</b> is oriented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The rating of the hash-memory effectiveness increase by the proposed approach is also presented.
