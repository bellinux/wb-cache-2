In a 2004 essay later included in his Despre minciună ("On Lies") volume, philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu used a sequence of the story, that in which the Bald Man succeeds in convincing everyone {{that he is the}} king's son, to construct a critical metaphor of Romania's own post-communist history. Accusing the political system which had emerged in 1989 of promoting political corruption instead of reform, Liiceanu contended: [...] "The 'Sign of the Bald Man' is the sign of incipient tyranny, originating with the cathartically interrupted act of the December Revolution and a Harap Alb who has been silenced. [...] But [...] there does come a time when corruption becomes extreme, when it becomes glaring for anyone to see, when everyone finds out that the Bald Man is the Bald Man and not Harap Alb. At that moment in time, a people should have an extraordinary chance in finding a living Harap Alb". The metaphor also drew a parallel between the fairy tale protagonist and Niccolò Machiavelli's theories about the ideal prince, both taken as symbols of men capable to act against public perception for the greater good (see Machiavellianism). Commenting on this vision, essayist and political analyst Arthur Suciu argued that the [...] "living Harap Alb" [...] Liiceanu was referring to may have been Traian Băsescu, elected President of Romania during the 2004 election. Another interpretation of the story in relation to 21st century realities comes from Indian scholar Jacob Srampickal. <b>He</b> <b>evidences</b> {{the manner in which the}} protagonist and his fellowship cooperate, and choosing [...] "Harap Alb" [...] as [...] "one of the best metaphors" [...] for interdisciplinarity, notes: [...] "while each participant played his role at the right time, the awareness of the mission belonged always to the hero".|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} is asked {{because it is}} often thought that real humility (low opinion of oneself, not self-assertive) cannot exist together with a messianic consciousness. Jesus made large claims for himself {{and the importance of}} his actions and teaching, seeing himself as endowed with unique closeness to the Father in heaven and therefore religious authority, but did not strive for ordinary social power or high positions. His humility is ultimately oriented towards the Father, not to contemporary leaders and teachers. <b>He</b> <b>evidences</b> robust self-confidence, based on accepting Son-ship from the Father...|$|E
40|$|There {{are still}} {{problems}} in handling diversity in economics. The {{general equilibrium model}} itself lacks determinacy for a generic population of economic agents. In an outstanding contribution, Jean-Michel Grandmont (1992) argues that increasing behavioural heterogeneity makes aggregate expenditures more independent of prices. He conjectures that, in the aggregate, weak axiom of revealed preference, gross substitutability, uniqueness and stability of the Walrassian exchange equilibrium would prevail under "at enough" distributions of characteristics. This note emphasises the specific nature of the distributions involved in Grandmont's framework and enhances that the strong macroeconomic regularities that <b>he</b> <b>evidences</b> cannot {{be considered as a}} general property of exchange markets...|$|E

40|$|If {{there are}} lies, which is their limit in {{relation}} to truth? Out of real problems that he was facing at the time, related the religious heresies and conflicts, Saint Augustine supplies insights on the subject in two texts “On Lie” (De Mendacium) and “Against Lie” (Contra Mendacium). There are good reasons to believe that his concern with the subject was recurrent, since the two texts are practically identical. Without pretensions to define what truth is, the bishop of Hippona applies his negative method to create a tipology of existing kinds of lies. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>evidences</b> a almost completely forgotten fact nowadays: beyond the diversity of species of lie, if something is not true, it only can be false...|$|E
