40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an ansatz for {{defining}} Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds, using perverse sheaves of vanishing cycles. Our proposal is {{a modification of}} a recent approach of Kiem-Li, which is itself based on earlier ideas of Hosono-Saito-Takahashi. We conjecture that these invariants are equivalent to other curve-counting theories such as Gromov-Witten theory and Pandharipande-Thomas theory. Our main theorem is that, for local surfaces, our invariants agree with PT invariants for irreducible one-cycles.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to deformation <b>invariant</b> image <b>matching.</b> Our matcher (a) aligns templates to targets over a broad range of nonlinear deformations, (b) factors the total deformation into spectral categories, where low wavenumber deformations are smooth and global and high wavenumbers are turbulent and local, and (c) weighs the reduction in template-target misfit within each category to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant deformations. It accomplishes this by aligning images in a scale-cascaded fashion, with more complex, local deformations following simpler, more global ones. Each step of the cascade involves finding an iterative solution to a nonlinear optimization problem using a Gabor deformation basis. Cascaded alignment makes deformation <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> feasible and efficient.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn computer vision many techniques {{have been developed}} for object recognition. The affine <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm proposed by Hummel and Wolfson (1988) is a new and interesting method. Under affine invariant transformation, objects with translation, rotation, scale changes, and, or even partial occlusion will have the same or similar coefficients. However, some serious problems exist in the original algorithm. This thesis begins with the discussion of the affine transformation. The shortcomings that can occur in this method such as the basis instability, the collision of hash table, and the noise sensitivity will be discussed. Among them the noise sensitivity is a serious problem. This can always cause the recognition procedure to fail. In this thesis an improved affine <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm was developed to overcome the noise problem and other disadvantages of the original algorithm. The area test criteria were adopted to avoid the numerical instability problem. The modified hashing structure using a special hash function was implemented to achieve faster accessing and voting. In the recognition procedure, the partial voting technique with the consideration of false peaks from the voting array highly enhanced the noise tolerance of the algorithm. Finally, the results obtained from the improved algorithm clearly showed better performance than those of the original algorithm. [URL] Commander, Taiwan Republic of China Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the use of}} so-called top-points for object retrieval. These points are based on scale-space and catastrophe theory, and are invariant under gray value scaling and offset as well as scale-Euclidean transformations. The differential properties and noise characteristics of these points are mathematically well understood. It is possible to retrieve {{the exact location of}} a top-point from any coarse estimation through a closed-form vector equation which only depends on local derivatives in the estimated point. All these properties make top-points highly suitable as anchor points for <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> schemes. In a set of examples we show the excellent performance of top-points in an object retrieval task. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to deformation <b>invariant</b> image <b>matching.</b> Our approach retains the broad range of linear and nonlinear deformations that viscous alignment methods can model, but introduces a selectivity that is necessary for recognition. Our method models viscous kernels with an over-complete filter basis. The basis is parameterized with a single scalar parameter, the spectral radius r, which selects deformations ranging in complexity from tranlations to "turbulence. " The spectral radius is used for cascaded alignment starting from low deformation frequencies and finishing with high deformation frequencies. Cascaded alignment makes deformation <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> for recognition feasible and efficient. Because spectral radii map directly to deformation complexity, their contributions are selectively weighed to calculate the template-target similarity. In this way, our model can distinguish deformations by their relevance to recognition, without losing the flexibility of viscous alignment for handling nonlinear deformations. Our approach is applied to recognize flexible bodies of animals, and results indicate that the method is very promising. by Christopher Minzer Yang. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Abstract—Based upon a new {{correspondence}} <b>matching</b> <b>invariant</b> called illumination chromaticity constancy, {{we present}} a new solution for illumination chromaticity estimation, correspondence searching, and specularity removal. Using as few as two images, {{the core of our}} method is the computation of a vote distribution for a number of illumination chromaticity hypotheses via correspondence matching. The hypothesis with the highest vote is accepted as correct. The estimated illumination chromaticity is then used together with the new <b>matching</b> <b>invariant</b> to <b>match</b> highlights, which inherently provides solutions for correspondence searching and specularity removal. Our method differs from the previous approaches: those treat these vision problems separately and generally require that specular highlights be detected in a preprocessing step. Also, our method uses more images than previous illumination chromaticity estimation methods, which increases its robustness because more inputs/constraints are used. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To become affine invariant they apply a discrete set of affine transforms to the images, previous to the comparison of all images by a Scale <b>Invariant</b> Image <b>Matching</b> (SIIM), like SIFT. Obviously this multiplication of images to be compared increases the image matching complexity. Three questions arise: a) {{what is the best}} set of affine transforms to apply to each image to gain full practical affine invariance? b) what is the lowest attainable complexity for the resulting method? c) how to choose the underlying SIIM method? We provide an explicit answer and a mathematical proof of quasi-optimality of the solution to the first question. As an answer to b) we find that the near-optimal complexity ratio between full affine <b>matching</b> and scale <b>invariant</b> <b>matching</b> is more than halved, compared to the current IMAS methods. This means that the number of key points necessary for affine matching can be halved, and that the matching complexity is divided by four for exactly the same performance.

INTRODUCTION Image stabilization is the image registration applied to one video image sequence from a single camera. When the camera is mounted on an unsteady or moving platform and objects are far from the camera, the 3 -D space motion of the camera will affect the images.

Our interface uses a graspable device called the Tango, {{which looks like}} a ball but measures contact pressures on its surface at 256 tactual elements (taxels) at a high rate (100 Hz).
