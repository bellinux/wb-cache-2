5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E
5|$|The Legislature of Singapore {{consists}} of the President and the Parliament.

50|$|Plato {{rejected}} Athenian democracy on {{the basis}} that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.|$|R

40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{relationship}} between democracy and exchange rate regimes. Evidence from a cluster analysis and a panel analysis suggests that <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> not all equally likely to float their exchange rates. While <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> more likely to float than autocracies <b>are,</b> established <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> more likely to choose a fixed exchange rate regime because they are better able than transition democracies to make the credible commitments needed for a cooperative arrangement. More established <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> more able to join cooperative arrangements that allow them to make a less constrained choice between floating and fixing. democracy; transition democracies; exchange rates; cluster analysis; transition economies. ...|$|R
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed <b>democracy,</b> <b>is</b> not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>Democracy</b> <b>is</b> a short 2005 French {{political}} film made by Alex Chan using {{computer animation}} from Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies. The plot centers on three Moroccan men who turn to rioting after facing {{different forms of}} discrimination. Chan, a French native of Chinese descent, created the film to convey his view that racism caused the riots of the 2005 civil unrest in France. Although Chan was restricted by shortcomings and technical limitations in The Movies, he finished the film after four days of production.|$|E

25|$|Deliberative <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} the notion that <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> {{government}} by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E

25|$|More recently, <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> criticised for not {{offering}} enough political stability. As {{governments are}} frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the case}} of India, the authors deny an {{equivalence}} between inclusive political institutions and electoral democracy. Electoral <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> the de jure system adopted by a country while political institutions refer to the de facto structure and quality of political system of a certain country. For example, India's political system has long been dominated by the Congress Party; the provision of public goods is preyed upon by political Patrimonialism; various members of Lok Sabha (the Indian legislature) face criminal charges; and caste-based inequality still exists. The quality of <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> very poor and thus the political institutions are flawed in India, which explains why economic institutions are equally poor and economic growth is stymied.|$|E
