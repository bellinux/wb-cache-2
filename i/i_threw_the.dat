He bursts in, wearing baseball clothes, carrying a bat and glove, and proudly tells them that during his softball game, [...] "I made an incredible {{play in the}} field!

It was the single greatest moment in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|By the 1970s, a {{combination}} of the recession, overpriced food, and fear of football hooligans had greatly reduced the services' popularity. The quality of the food declined substantially and, because of its prominent location, the services became a byword for poor catering. Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album, Bullinamingvase, writing: [...] "Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap". The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar. Harper defended his decision to write the song, claiming the food was [...] "junk. Absolute junk". [...] In 1989, one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network, adding [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> toast out of the window, it would probably still be bouncing up the M1." [...] Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities. In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

60|$|Presently, when B.'s {{boat was}} just right for his anglers to see {{everything}} my way, I felt a tug on my line. I leaped up, let the reel run.

Then <b>threw</b> on <b>the</b> drag and got ready. But, no, he let go. Again <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> off <b>the</b> drag and again he came back. He was hungry, but he was cunning, too, and too far back for me to see. I let him run fifty feet, <b>threw</b> on <b>the</b> drag, and struck hard. No go! I missed him. But again <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> off <b>the</b> drag, let out more line back to him, {{and he took the}} bait the fourth time, and harder than ever. I let him run perhaps a hundred feet. All the time, of course, my boat was running. I had out a long line--two hundred yards. Then <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> on <b>the</b> drag and almost cracked the rod. This time I actually felt the hook go in.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1971, Bakshi {{moved his}} studio to Los Angeles to hire {{additional}} animators there. Some animators, including Rod Scribner, Dick Lundy, Virgil Walter Ross, Norman McCabe, and John Sparey, welcomed Bakshi's presence, {{and felt that}} Fritz the Cat would bring diversity to the animation industry. Other animators disliked Bakshi's presence, and placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, stating that Bakshi's [...] "filth" [...] was unwelcome in California. According to Bakshi, [...] "I didn't know who these guys were because I was from New York, so <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> ad away." [...] However, Bakshi found the negative reaction to the film from his peers to be disheartening.|$|E
2500|$|While Paths of Glory {{did not do}} well at the box office, it {{has since}} {{become one of the}} great anti-war films, and one of early films by {{director}} Stanley Kubrick. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's [...] "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men." [...] The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: [...] "I called Stanley to my room... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of... 'I got the money, based on that [...] script. Not this shit!' <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>the</b> script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.' Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, {{one of the most important}} pictures—possibly the most important picture—Stanley Kubrick has ever made." ...|$|E
