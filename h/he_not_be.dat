On 23 January 2013, he was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison. His plea that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
25|$|How far {{his love}} of man went may be seen from an example that shows that benevolence must be given {{with regard to the}} needs of the poor. Thus, Hillel {{provided}} a riding horse to a man of good family who became poor, in order that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deprived of his customary physical exercise; he also gave him a slave, that he might be served (Tosef., Peah, iv. 10; Ket. 67b).|$|E

Had <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> with that pirate Hawkins in the affair at San Juan de Ulloa? And so on. Questions poured upon him and engulfed him.|$|R

25|$|Carlisle {{became a}} leader of the {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and was mentioned as a presidential candidate but the Democrats passed him over at their conventions for Winfield S. Hancock in 1880 and Grover Cleveland in 1884. Discomfort with nominating a southerner after the Civil War played a role in Carlisle's failure to win either nomination. In 1892 Carlisle was again proposed as a candidate for president at the Democratic convention, but this time Carlisle asked that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered. It was reported at the time that Carlisle dropped out with the understanding that Cleveland, once nominated, would appoint him to his Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, {{despite being}} a lifelong Conservative, Chelmsford was persuaded {{to join the}} Labour {{government}} of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 as First Lord of the Admiralty, {{due to the fact}} that Labour had so few peers in the House of Lords. He never joined the party and only agreed on the condition that the Navy's size be maintained and that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> expected to attend any cabinet meetings of a political nature. He was duly sworn in by King George V on 23 January 1924 at Buckingham Palace. He was appointed as a Commissioner exercising the office of Lord High Admiral three times on 1 April 15 August 1924 and 9 October 1924. Chelmsford was chairman of the Miners' Welfare Committee under the Mining Industry Act of 1920 and of the royal commission on mining subsidence in 1923–24. After the fall of the government in November 1924, he retired from political life.|$|E
25|$|Brown’s {{performance}} and subsequent reputation were mixed. Major General Charles H. Corlett, then commanding the XIX Corps, thought Brown needed a medical leave {{because he was}} sick and “rundown.” One of Brown’s battalion commanders thought Brown was {{not up to the}} challenge of commanding large units in combat and described him as “frantic.” Bradley, now a lieutenant general, commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, and General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), believed Brown was personally brave, but not an inspirational leader, and that his soldiers underperformed as a result. Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, such as Major Generals Terry Allen and Orlando Ward, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given another command. Marshall concurred. Brown was replaced by Brigadier General James Edward Wharton, who was killed by a sniper while visiting the front-line soon after he took command. He, in turn, was replaced by Brigadier General Norman Cota, formerly the ADC of the 29th Infantry Division.|$|E

25|$|After confronting his wife, Gavrik {{locks the}} door and {{strangles}} Elena to death. Sasha is unable to stop it. Meanwhile, Ruth joins Harry outside the bunker, and they both decide to leave the intelligence service and live together. However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth). He then walks onto the Grid, sits down at his desk and answers the phone, indicating he intends to continue working in the service.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, Robert Ridgway was a {{founding}} member of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) and he became an associate editor of the organization's journal The Auk. He was prevailed upon to serve as an officer of the organization, but on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> required to preside at public meetings. [...] He served as a vice president of the AOU (September 1883 – November 1891) and as its president (November 1898 – November 1900).|$|E
500|$|The Sixth Amendment also {{regulates the}} {{availability}} and use of cause and peremptory challenges. For example, it precludes a jurisdiction from granting the prosecution for-cause removal of jurors who oppose the death penalty. [...] "The most that can be demanded of a venireman {{in this regard is}} that he be willing to consider all of the penalties provided by state law, and that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> irrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge {{in the course of the}} proceedings." [...] While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory challenges to cure a trial court's erroneous denial of a defendant's for-cause challenge, if the defendant does so, the defendant may not rely on the error for automatic reversal.|$|E

500|$|Archimedes died c. 212BC {{during the}} Second Punic War, when Roman forces under General Marcus Claudius Marcellus {{captured}} {{the city of}} Syracuse after a two-year-long siege. According to the popular account given by Plutarch, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, {{saying that he had}} to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a [...] account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> harmed. Marcellus called Archimedes [...] "a geometrical Briareus".|$|E
500|$|By mid-December, the {{government}} had received around 1,500 letters related to Patton, with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion. [...] Kuhl's father, Herman F. Kuhl, wrote to his own congressman, stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> disciplined. Retired generals also weighed in on the matter. Former Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall wrote to Patton that he was [...] "indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident", adding that [...] "whatever [...] did" [...] he {{was sure it was}} [...] "justified by the provocation. Such cowards used to be shot, now they are only encouraged." [...] Major General Kenyon A. Joyce, another combat commander and one of Patton's friends, attacked Pearson as a [...] "sensation mongerer," [...] stating that [...] "niceties" [...] should be left for [...] "softer times of peace." [...] In one notable dissension, Patton's friend, former mentor and General of the Armies John J. Pershing publicly condemned his actions, an act that left Patton [...] "deeply hurt" [...] and caused him to never speak to Pershing again.|$|E
500|$|In the Fourth Test, the Australians worked {{themselves}} into a position to win the match and thus retain the Ashes. Hassett made 37 as his team compiled 266 and took a 99-run first innings lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes {{at the start of}} the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match. Hassett made only four, but Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side in order to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 4/147 when time ran out. English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that [...] "they were right" [...] in claiming that Bailey's bowling was [...] "the worst kind of negative cricket" [...] and that he had [...] "cheated [...] of victory". The match was also marred by a series of umpiring decisions made by Frank Chester against the Australians, leading Hassett to request that <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> appointed for the Fifth Test, something the English cricket authorities granted.|$|E
