50|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) casting is a {{modified}} die casting process that reduces or eliminates the residual porosity present in most die castings. Rather than using liquid metal as the feed material, SSM casting uses a higher viscosity feed {{material that is}} partially solid and partially liquid. A modified die casting machine is used to inject the semi-solid slurry into re-usable hardened steel dies. The high viscosity of the semi-solid metal, along {{with the use of}} controlled <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> conditions, ensures that the semi-solid metal fills the die in a non-turbulent manner so that harmful porosity can be essentially eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Whatever {{process is}} {{used to make the}} {{tableting}} blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into the die from above. The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch. After <b>die</b> <b>filling,</b> the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500-50 ms per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled {{up and out of the}} die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die. This process is repeated for each tablet.|$|E
50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} lower and upper punches accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for <b>die</b> <b>filling,</b> and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|E

Semi-solid processing of metallic alloys and composites utilises the thixotropic behaviour of materials with non-dendritic microstructure in the semi-solid state. Modelling of <b>die</b> <b>fill</b> leads to more effective die design to avoid defects. Here approaches to modelling are summarised. They can be categorised as one phase or two phase and as finite difference or finite element. Although many workers have qualitatively compared their predictions with experimental results (usually obtained through interrupted filling), there is little quantitative data. There are no direct comparisons of the capabilities of various software packages to model <b>die</b> <b>fill</b> accurately. In addition, the modelling depends on rheological data. This is sparse, particularly for the increasingly complex two-phase models. Direct flow visualisation can provide useful insight and avoid the effects of inertia in interrupted filling experiments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Die</b> <b>filling</b> is {{the first}} step of the powder {{technological}} process chain which is followed by the subsequent steps of compaction, debinding, and sintering. Due to the complexity of these steps, defects can occur during the process chain, which may evolve to excessive variations in the final stages and lead to off-specification batches and severe waste of resources. The process of <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> is of particular importance, as it defines the starting conditions of the follow-up processes. An inhomogeneity in the powder distribution can lead to warpage during sintering or inhomogeneous final properties. Therefore, understanding and controlling the <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> process is a key requirement for the optimization of the process parameters such as shape, acceleration and speed of the shoe. Predicti ve modelling of the complete <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> process, including effects of powder handling history on the rheology can immensely assist in optimizing the whole manufacturing process and reduce costs. Numerous studies employing the discrete elements method have been done in the past. However, the vast majority of these studies assumes rather homogeneously flowing powders and excludes effects like sticking, caking, and flow separation. In this work, we will demonstrate the application of enhanced contact force models to <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> process simulations, which is an important step towards the predictive simulation of the filling behaviour of powders with unfavourable flow properties as an engineering tool in the process development...|$|E

40|$|<b>Die</b> <b>filling</b> from a {{stationary}} shoe {{in a vacuum}} and {{in the presence of}} air was numerically, analyzed using an Eulerian-Lagrangian model, which employs a discrete element method (DEM) for the particles and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the air with a two-way air-particle interaction coupling term. Monodisperse and polydisperse powder systems have been simulated to explore the effect of the presence of air on the <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> process. For <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> with monodisperse powders, the influences of particle size and density on the flow behavior were explored. The numerical simulations revealed that the presence of air has {{a significant impact on the}} powder flow behavior, especially for systems with smaller and/or lighter particles. Flow has been characterized in terms of a dimensionless mass flow rate, and it has been shown that for <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> in a vacuum this is constant. The flow characteristics for <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> in air can be classified into two regimes. There is an air-inert regime in which the particle size and density are sufficiently large that the effect of air flow becomes negligible, and the dimensionless mass flow rate is essentially identical to that obtained for <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> in a vacuum. There is also an air-sensitive regime, for smaller particle sizes and lower particle densities, in which the dimensionless mass flow rate increases as the particle size and density increase. The effects of particle-size distribution and adhesion on the flow behavior have also been investigated. It was found that, in a vacuum, the dimensionless mass flow, rate for polydisperse systems is nearly identical to that for monodisperse systems. In the presence of air, a lower dimensionless mass flow rate is obtained for polydisperse systems compared to monodisperse systems, demonstrating that air effects become more significant. Furthermore, it has been shown that, as expected, the dimensionless mass flow rate decreases as the surface energy increases (i. e., for more cohesive powders).

40|$|In this thesis, {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer within discrete element method framework is presented. The {{main focus of}} the work is to explore the contribution of <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer processes towards the density variation of the powder mass before compaction. The numerical investigations are carried out to provide alternative solutions in understanding <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer mechanisms {{because of the lack of}} theoretical and experimental solutions in the two fields. Validation of the code used was successfully carried out by comparing simulation results with the existing results of powder flow experiments conducted in controlled environment which imitate realistic industrial settings. The effects of shoe kinematics, punch kinematics, contact parameters, modelling parameters, die geometry, die orientation, and shoe volume on <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer have been identified. It has been confirmed that multiple passes, multiple shoe columns and powder shifting can improve powder packing. The die fill is found to decrease with the increase in friction and cohesion. On the contrary, it increases with the increase of damping. The combination of slow shoe speed during filling and slow punch speed during transfer is found to result in homogeneous powder packing inside the die. The research has also successfully integrated <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer in one continuous sequence in a three dimensional setting. Simulation works have also been performed on the Variable Aperture Flowmeter to evaluate the effects of particle composition on critical aperture and angle of repose, and to determine powder flow rate. Investigations were also conducted on the bridging phenomena which conclude that bridging for monodispersed circular particles stops when the orifice is set at 5. 5 particle width. The result however may change with different values of contact parameters and particle properties. Numerical study performed has shown that the discrete element method is capable of reproducing several key phenomena observed in <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> and powder transfer processes and to some extent capable of characterising powder flow in a simulated variable aperture flowmeter...|$|E

The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> as a case study. The <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG).

This FE simulation considers the influence of several parameters which influence the developments of flaws during injection forging. By considering friction conditions at the anvil, the aspect ratio of the primary deformation zone, the exit geometry and the inhomogeneity of the material, the types of flaws which are initiated and the subsequent <b>die</b> <b>filling</b> are simulated using ABAQUS code.
