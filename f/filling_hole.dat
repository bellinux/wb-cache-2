50|$|The furnace installation, {{known as}} Anderson's Cupola. burned coke {{and used a}} steam-powered fan to produce a forced draft. From the time of lighting, around an hour was {{required}} to bring 7 -Scwt kg of pig iron to its melting point of 1150 to 1200 C - this amount could fill thirty 8-inch shells. After filling, the shells were left {{for a few minutes}} before firing, which allowed the metal in the <b>filling</b> <b>hole</b> to solidify and seal the hole. The shells remained effective even if an hour elapsed between filling and firing as, by this time, the filling would have solidified and the shell casing heated, making them equivalent to conventional heated shot. This included shells that had failed to break up on impact and had remained embedded in the timbers of the target.|$|E
50|$|The tank is {{internally}} braced, {{and also}} wind braced externally. Unlike the water tank retained at Grandchester station, the Murphy's Creek tank features a high flow water delivery system utilising a water jib or crane. An electric pump {{is used to}} reticulate water into the tank being supplied from mains power. A swing jib is situated on the north tank face adjacent to the mainline, and is used to deliver water through a gravity-fed pipe-work system into a corresponding <b>filling</b> <b>hole</b> on the tender water tank of a steam locomotive. A canvas hose is used to direct {{the flow of water}} into the tender tank. The jib is operated manually by a locomotive fireman standing on the tender tank, swinging the jib to a position 90 degrees {{from the face of the}} tank and controlling the flow of water from the jib via a valve and float system actuated on the filling pipe. An inspection ladder is situated on the east face of the tank enabling access to the tank for maintenance purposes. A fluorescent light is also affixed to the tank headstocks to illuminate the area at night.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a method for the three-dimensional skeletal graph generation of liver vessels using 3 D thinning algorithm and graph theory. First of all, the principal methods for skeletonization are introduced, followed by their comparative analysis. Secondly, the 3 D thinning-based skeletonization method together with a <b>filling</b> <b>hole</b> pre-processing on liver vessel image is employed to form the liver skeleton. A graph-based technique is then employed on the skeleton image to efficiently form the liver vascular graph.

40|$|As {{consumers}} {{are becoming increasingly}} selective of what they wear on their feet, manufacturing encountered the problem of developing right footwear. It is widely accepted that the threedimensional model of foot can help in good shoe fitting. Footwear fitter have been using manual measurement for a long time, but the combination of 3 D scanning systems with mathematical technique makes possible the development of systems, which can help {{in the selection of}} good footwear for a given customer. In this paper, we proposed new approach for finding footwear fit within the shoe last data base. Our new approach is based on the efficient algorithm for cutting 3 D triangle mesh to several sections toward heel and toe. Then the area of each contour is calculated and compared with area of equal section in shoe last data base for finding footwear fit. The first step is to fill holes in triangle mesh; after solving this post-process problem, our method is applied for finding footwear fit within shoe last data base. In summary, the problem of finding the best fitting shoe within a given shoe last data base, using input data taken from the 3 D foot scan of client consists of two main sub problem:- <b>Filling</b> <b>hole</b> in triangle mesh. - Cutting the model to several sections to search though the shoe last data base for finding footwear fit.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the molecular filtering effect of TiO 2 has a significant influence on dye solar cell (DSC) performance. As electrolyte is injected to a DSC, some of the electrolyte components adsorb to the surface TiO 2 (here 4 -tert-butylpyridine and 1 -methyl-benzimidazole) and accumulate near the electrolyte <b>filling</b> <b>hole</b> resulting in varying electrolyte composition and performance across the cell. The spatial performance distribution was investigated with a new method, the segment cell method. Not only is the segmented cell method simple and cheap {{when compared to the}} only other method for examining spatial variation (photocurrent mapping), it also has the major advantage of allowing the spatial variation in all other operating parameters to be assessed. Here the molecular filtering effect was to influence the cell performance in case of all the five studied electrolytes causing up to 35 % losses in efficiency. Raman spectra indicated that the loss in photocurrent in the electrolyte filling was in correlation with the loss of thiocyanate ligands suggesting that dye regeneration may also be a significant factor in addition to electron injection in some of the cells. There were also shifts in the absorption spectra the photoelectrodes which further supported changes in the thiocyanate ligands. Besides absorption changes, there were additional shifts in the IPCE spectra which may relate to deprotonation of the dye. The efficiency losses were reduced to ∼ 10 % with contemporary electrolyte compositions. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} an algorithm {{to synthesize}} missing geometry {{for a given}} triangle mesh that has “holes. ” Similarly to previous work, the algorithm is context-based in that it <b>fills</b> the <b>hole</b> by synthesizing geometry {{that is similar to}} the remainder of the input mesh. Our algorithm goes further to impose a coherence objective. A synthesis is coherent if every local neighborhood of the <b>filled</b> <b>hole</b> is similar to some local neighborhood of the input mesh. This requirement avoids the undesired features, which can happen in contextbased completion. We demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to <b>fill</b> <b>holes</b> that were difficult or impossible to fill in a compelling manner by earlier approaches...|$|R
30|$|<b>Holes</b> <b>filling</b> method gives {{possibility}} to introduce more quantity of powder {{compared with that}} of groove filling method. Escape of the powder during FSP is less in <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> method {{compared with that of}} groove <b>filling</b> method. Similarly, <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method gives more control over the particle incorporation compared with that of groove <b>filling</b> and <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> methods but requires more operations. For applications, where more quantity is not necessary but slight modification is enough to alter the surface properties, simple groove filling method or groove filling and closing method can be adapted. Groove filling method is also appropriate to obtain thick composite layers compared with other processes as shown in Table  1. Of course, the thickness of a composite layer depends on the FSP tool pin dimensions and processing parameters. Where applications demand more amount of secondary phase at the surface, <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> or <b>holes</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method can be chosen.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electrolyte}} filling method {{on the performance}} of the dye-sensitized solar cells is investigated with the segmented cell method, a recent technique which is very simple but effective as {{it can be used to}} examine all the photovoltaic characteristics. The electrolyte filling techniques compared were single injection, which is typically used in small laboratory cells, and pumping the electrolyte through the cell several times, which is often used for larger cells and modules. Significant photovoltage and photocurrent variations occur with the repeated pumping of the electrolyte in the cell preparation. Transient and charge extraction measurements confirmed that the differences in open circuit voltage were due to the shifts of the TiO 2 conduction band and time correlated single photon counting confirmed that the reduction of short circuit current was largely due to reduced electron injection correlated with the increasing conduction band edge in the studied cases. This was interpreted as an effect of molecular filtering by the TiO 2 causing an accumulation of electrolyte additives (4 -tert-butylpyridine and benzimidazole) near the electrolyte <b>filling</b> <b>hole,</b> the concentration of which increased with repeated pumping of the electrolyte. Interestingly, spatial variations were seen not only in the relative TiO 2 conduction band energy but also in the density of trap states. In this contribution it is demonstrated how the changes in the conduction band can be separated from the changes in the density of trap states which is an essential for the correct interpretation of the data.

We use a signed distance field (SDF) as an intermediate representation, which stores Euclidean signed distances from a voxel to the nearest point of the mesh model.

Once we make the SDF consistent, we can efficiently <b>fill</b> <b>holes</b> and gaps. ...|$|R
