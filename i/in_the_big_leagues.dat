5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.|$|E
