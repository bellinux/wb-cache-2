25|$|The Agreement was {{preceded by}} the Ohrid discussions, a series of talks between Albanian and Macedonian representatives, along with representatives from the United States and European Union. The talks took place in Ohrid in the {{south-west}} of Macedonia. The agreement was negotiated by Zoran Jolevski, Secretary General of President Boris Trajkovski. The Macedonian side was represented by the VMRO-DPMNE and the SDSM, while the Albanian side was represented by the DPA and the PDP. Although actively participating in armed conflict, the National Liberation Army did not participate directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E
25|$|The FNV {{was founded}} in 1976 as a {{federation}} of two unions, the Catholic NKV and the social-democratic NVV. The Protestant CNV originally also participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks,</b> but it refused to fully merge into a new union. The federation was founded because of declining membership, due to depillarization and increasing political polarization between left and right. The two fused officially in 1982. Wim Kok, who had already been chair of NVV between 1973 and 1976 became chair of the new organization, which he remained until 1986 when entered parliament for the PvdA.|$|E

The day before, Mutambara's group of the MDC announced that they would refuse to work with ZANU-PF if talks were deadlocked. Both Tsvangirai and Mugabe spoke positively of the talks on 10 September 2008.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 2014, Maariv {{reported}} that Israeli and American leaders had been discussing, and seriously considering, {{the possibility of}} ceding parts of the Arab Triangle to the Palestinians in exchange for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The residents of the Triangle would automatically become Palestinian citizens if this happened. This idea {{is similar to the}} Lieberman Plan. Rami Hamdallah also said that despite Erekat's insistence that the talks had failed, the Palestinians would continue participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks</b> until the April deadline. On 5 January, hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition threatened to withdraw from the government if he accepted the 1967 borders as a baseline for talks. Dovish opposition parties, such as Labor, have said they would join if this occurs, in order to prevent the coalition from breaking up completely. On 9 January, according to insiders, support for a two-state agreement within the Knesset stood at 85 in favor to 35 opposed. In addition to the Labor Party, American negotiators were also attempting to persuade Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, both of which are generally supportive of the peace process, to join the government to keep negotiations alive.|$|E
25|$|In January 1962 Wasfi Al-Tal was {{appointed}} prime minister. The controversial young politician who worked to bring sweeping reforms resigned after Hussein sought to solidify his position following {{the rise of}} the Nasser-supporting Ba'ath party to the governments of Iraq and Syria in two 1963 coups. The first direct contacts between Jordan and Israel started in early 1960s; Hussein had a Jewish doctor named Emmanuel Herbert who acted as intermediary between the two nations during Hussein's visits to London. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks,</b> Hussein highlighted his commitment to a peaceful resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. His secret rapprochement with Israel was followed by a public rapprochement with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1964, which bolstered Hussein's popularity both in Jordan and in the Arab world. Hussein received a warm welcome after visiting West Bank cities afterwards. The rapprochement with Nasser happened during the 1964 Arab League summit in Cairo, where the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) were established, and where Jordan agreed to join the United Arab Command. During the summit Nasser also attempted to convince Hussein to purchase Soviet weapons, but the Americans provided Hussein with tanks and jets instead, with the understanding {{that they would not be}} used in the West Bank at Israel's request. The PLO identified itself as a representative of the Palestinian people, which clashed with Jordan's sovereignty claim over the West Bank. The PLO started to demand that the Jordanian government legalize their activities, including the setting up of Palestinian armed units to fight Israel; the requests were denied.|$|E

500|$|McAvoy {{declared}} {{that since he}} [...] "had a blast making the first Wanted", {{he would make a}} sequel regardless {{of the quality of the}} script; however, he also acknowledged that the extended time the film spent in development [...] "suggests to me that they're not finding it very easy to come up with a story that they're passionate about, so we'll have to wait and see."

500|$|The {{transitional}} government was badly received abroad, {{partly because the}} Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control. No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration. Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so {{with the assistance of}} the mining corporation Lonrho. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks.</b> According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and [...] "seemed on the verge of success" [...] by the start of September 1978. On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place.|$|E

500|$|The CP finally {{called for}} a renewed {{dialogue}} in December, yet his speech [...] "contained generous nods to the Khawalid [...] influence". The new dialogue began in February 2013, however the CP did not participate, despite opposition calls for him. Al-Mushīr's spokesman tweeted that participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks</b> were [...] "donkeys" [...] and warned that any concession would amount to a [...] "coup".

500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks</b> with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. But to me, it was over. As I said to the Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|Monday 10 May {{saw another}} day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to {{continue}} negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but {{that one of the}} barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to [...] "sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election." [...] The statement went on to say, [...] "I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post {{by the time of the}} Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate." [...] He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, [...] "I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic–the numbers don't add up." [...] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talks</b> – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. [...] " [...] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences".|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is a conversation analysis study {{which focuses on}} the analysis of repair as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show, <b>The</b> Oprah Winfrey Show, a special episode with Michael Jackson. The objectives of the study are: (1) to investigate the type of repair, and (2) to identify the pattern of repair employed by <b>the</b> participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show <b>The</b> Oprah Winfrey Show. This research employed a descriptive qualitative method since the findings were presented in narrative or textual description. The data sources of the research were the transcript of conversation and the video of the special episode of <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show <b>The</b> Oprah Winfrey Show. This episode was considered special since the duration is longer than the ordinary episodes. This research applied triangulation technique to check and establish validity. The research reveals two things. First, the 72 repairs uttered by <b>the</b> participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show <b>The</b> Oprah Winfrey Showbelong to four types, i. e. self-initiated self-repair, self-initiated other-repair, other-initiated self-repair, and other-initiated other-repair. Self-initiated self-repair is employed most often, i. e. 55 times. This result seems plausible since <b>in</b> most cases <b>the</b> participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show <b>The</b> Oprah Winfrey Shownotice their own-making error and tend to repair the error themselves. Other-initiated self-repair is ranked second since it appears 12 times. This type occurs for mishearing, non-hearing, or misunderstanding experienced by the interlocutor. The remaining two, otherinitiated other-repair (3 times) and self-initiated other repair (twice), are rarely employed, and therefore they are ranked the lowest. Second, there are ten patterns applied to deliver repair completions. Reorganization is the most-often pattern occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show, i. e. 13 times. Since <b>the</b> participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> show often have long speeches, the information they delivered are sometimes not properly arranged. Reorganization is best employed because it enables the speaker to adjust the sequence of <b>the</b> messages <b>in</b> his utterance. Some other patterns to complete repairs are employed quite often as well. They are elaboration (10 times), abandonment (9 times), exemplification (8 times), and replacement (7 times). Both specification and completion appear 6 times. Likewise, both modification and rewording occur 5 times. Repetition is ranked the lowest; it appears 3 times...|$|R
