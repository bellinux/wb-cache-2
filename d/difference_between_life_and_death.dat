25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords {{in return for the}} patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death</b> in the early 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they can mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> and consequently where {{the rules and regulations}} for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E
25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in {{the right amount of}} powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure {{for long periods of}} time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E

The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] follow this trend, and often fail to {{delineate}} the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> Each creates an ambiguity between the sublime and nothingness, {{as they attempt to}} reconcile {{the question of how to}} convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, [...] "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth."

2500|$|A popular myth {{states that}} Gurkha soldiers, {{fighting}} for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces {{of the soldiers}} they encountered.

Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. [...] Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{original}} manuscript, Tonio sang the opera's final line, [...] "!", paralleling the prologue, also sung by Tonio.

John Wright has analysed the dramaturgy of the opera {{in the context of}} assignment of the final line, and concluded that {{the original}} assignment of the final line to Tonio is the most consistent and appropriate assignment. Wright says that Tonio shows more deliberate control in his manipulation of the other characters in order to obtain his revenge upon Nedda, after she has rejected him, and is more aware of the demarcation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> art. By contrast, Canio is unaware of the behind-the-scenes manipulations and surrenders control of his perception of the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> art as the opera proceeds.|$|R

5000|$|Vitalism is {{the belief}} that [...] "living organisms are {{fundamentally}} different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things". [...] Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "vital spark", [...] "energy" [...] or [...] "élan vital", which some equate with the soul. In the 18th and 19th century vitalism was discussed among biologists, in a discussion between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> non-life and vitalists who argued that life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed testable hypotheses meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism to have been refuted by empirical evidence, and hence as belonging to the realm of religion rather than that of science.|$|R

He worked much as a barber does who hones a razor, and with every {{evidence}} of similar practice; but his proficiency was the result of years of painstaking effort. Unaided he had worked out a method of his own for putting an edge upon the shell--he even tested it with the ball of his thumb--and when it met with his approval he grasped a wisp of hair which fell across his eyes, grasped it between the thumb and first finger of his left hand and sawed upon it with the sharpened shell until it was severed. All around his head he went until his black shock was rudely bobbed with a ragged bang in front. For the appearance of it he cared nothing; but in the matter of safety and comfort it meant everything.

Such interventions could lead to proteins being incorrectly produced or not produced at all. The consequences of such modifications are not necessarily serious; they may even be without consequence. However, nobody can predict this in advance. For precisely that reason, the consequences of a supposedly small intervention, albeit an intervention entailing a new patentable modification, must be thoroughly investigated before the modified organisms are irrevocably released into the environment [25, 26]. The opinion of the judges of the ECJ reflected this scientific assessment. The judges specified how organisms that have been developed using the new tools of genetic engineering are to be regulated.
