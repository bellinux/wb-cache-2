5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the stories <b>were</b> inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|R
5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the adults started {{to spend some time}} on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, around 5 p.m., Wick's Bf 109 E-4 (Werknummer 5344 — factory number) {{was shot}} down, {{probably}} by twelve–victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron, though it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Wick {{fell victim to}} Pilot Officer Eric Marrs; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron may have also scored hits on Wick's aircraft; he was also shot down and killed during the battle.|$|E

50|$|On December 15, 1977, Kelly {{announced}} that he would not run for reelection in 1978. He said that although the MBM scandal had no effect on him in his district, it likely meant that he could never advance in the Senate leadership.

5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, {{although it has been}} generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Penda had his own motives for the killing.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy {{was also}} dynastic: the princes {{were to be}} elected by boyars from {{among the members of}} the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved {{naturally}} from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
50|$|Both Chiang Kai-shek and General Wego W.K. Chiang {{suspected}} that the intense bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Air Force was to support the diversionary Japanese operations against metropolitan Chongqing, {{as part of the}} invasion of Sichuan. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese army hoped that a terror campaign against Chongqing would force the Chinese authorities to break from the Allies and make a separate peace with Japan.|$|R
5|$|He <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island {{that had already been}} evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|R

5|$|The way the {{conflict}} is described, by counting only two casualties, may point {{that there was a}} duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield. After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
50|$|The {{winner of}} the previour edition, Coppi, did not defend his title. The reasons were not clear: {{it could have been}} injury, but it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Coppi did not want to ride in the same team as his rival Gino Bartali, or that the Tour {{direction}} urged the Italian team not to select Coppi because he had dominated the 1952 Tour, or that Coppi chose to prepare for the 1953 UCI Road World Championships. The big favourites became Hugo Koblet and Louison Bobet.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} {{mentioned}} observations NFAP may {{get into the}} cell within 30  min in a concentration below the detectable level which might be enough {{to interfere with the}} actin localization and chitin distribution and to cause apoptosis. It could <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> these effects <b>are</b> secondary consequences of the NFAP action: NFAP may bind to a surface receptor which activates a signalling pathway that leads to apoptosis and defective polar growth. The susceptibility tests with A. nidulans signalling mutants indeed point towards signalling pathways affected by NFAP.|$|R
50|$|General Symptoms: General {{symptoms}} on the solanaceous {{crops and}} cucurbits include seed rot and seedling blight which discolors {{the roots and}} causes seedlings to topple over.

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed {{in the years following}} Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
50|$|A freihaus {{was often}} awarded as a fief; rarely they were allodial {{property}} of their owner. They were often {{part of a}} Burglehn quarter, in which the nobility among the defenders of a fortress were housed. However, it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the Prince privileged individual house sites in a city, and exempted them from the city's charter. There were often controversies between {{the owners of the}} freihaus and the city where they were located over the question if urban crafts could legally be practised in these houses, and if so, whether they were subject to the rules of the city guilds.|$|R
50|$|Matthias was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} first priests via a sortition (lot) process. After choosing nine members of the Unity that the synod attendees felt had gifts suitable for ministry, they took twelve slips of paper and wrote the words “it is he” on three of them. The slips of paper with those words would be called the positive lot because the members that drew those slips of paper would be selected as priests. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> none of the positives would be drawn, which would be seen as a sign from God that no priests should be selected.|$|R
50|$|Membership of the European Communities granted {{powers to}} European {{institutions}} which the 1937 constitution had vested {{exclusively in the}} Oireachtas (parliament) and the Government. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> many provisions of the constitution might be found to be incompatible with European law. For these reasons the Third Amendment introduced a provision expressly permitting the state to join the Communities and stating in broad terms that European law has supremacy over the constitution. Although the amendment shown above is that made to the English-language version of the constitution, constitutionally it is the Irish text that has precedence.|$|R
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|Fusō sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a {{few dozen}} men survived the rapid sinking and oil fire. There is {{evidence}} {{that some of these}} were rescued by the destroyer , which was itself sunk a short time later; it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> some who escaped the sinking reached Leyte only to be killed by Filipinos, as is known to have happened to survivors from other Japanese warships sunk in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E
50|$|When {{creating}} a handshake, the client could send an incorrectly formatted ClientHello message, leading to OpenSSL parsing {{more than the}} end of the message. Assigned the identifier CVE-2011-0014 by the CVE project, this affected all OpenSSL versions 0.9.8h to 0.9.8q and OpenSSL 1.0.0 to 1.0.0c. Since the parsing could lead to a read on an incorrect memory address, it was possible for the attacker to cause a DOS. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> some applications expose the contents of parsed OCSP extensions, leading to an attacker being able to read the contents of memory that came after the ClientHello.|$|R

That she did not say she had done so was, after all, no great consolation, for he knew Eveline Annersly could be silent when she had a reason.
