25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they <b>had,</b> <b>somebody</b> else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E
500|$|Bond {{joined the}} Bomb Squad, newly formed in January 1971 due to concern over The Angry Brigade. Bond became the unit's first {{commander}} on 23 June 1971, being promoted to that position in 1969. The unit served at Tintagel House, and Bond's name was theoretically {{meant to be}} kept secret {{and he should be}} called 'Commander X', so that he was not bombed, but journalists have since claimed to have known his name within days of his appointment. The press lauded Commander X as a [...] "mystery supremo to hunt down the Angry Brigade." [...] The Angry Brigade was a new political group; [...] "a small group [...] of leftwing radicals and anarchists," [...] who claimed responsibility for about 20 small bombings which began on 20 November 1970, with the bombing of a BBC van. At its formation, the Bomb Squad comprised around 30 men, one third from CID, the rest from Special Branch. The Angry Brigade's decline came in 1971, when various conspirators were arrested. At the 1971–72 trial, the nine conspirators were denied bail at Clerkenwell Court after Bond opposed the move, and the judge, J Purcell, [...] "remanded all nine in custody for a week." [...] There were concerns that the police had [...] "over-reached themselves." [...] The Angry Brigade member John Barker later said that [...] "the police framed a guilty man," [...] and Bond was called an [...] "old-fashioned plod" [...] by a defendant. He told the Purcell that [...] "I am quite certain that, sooner or later, we would have <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> killed." [...] Due to his success, in 1972 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Operations).|$|E
2500|$|At age 29, Givens {{made his}} big-league debut on June 24, 1995, {{pitching}} {{well in a}} loss. [...] In his second game, Givens was shelled. [...] "I would have sent {{him back to the}} minor leagues if I <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> else to replace him with", the Brewers' manager, Phil Garner, told the Sporting News. [...] "His problem was he wasn't throwing his breaking ball for strikes. [...] We got him to be more aggressive. [...] He responded. [...] I changed my opinion on him." [...] Givens earned his first major league win on July 16, 1995. [...] "There are a lot of guys who make it to the big leagues despite injuries or a lot of time served in the minors", Givens said shortly after his first big-league win. [...] "It just so happens persistence paid off for me. [...] I'm just very fortunate, with all my operations, I can still throw the ball the way I can." [...] Givens finished his rookie big-league season with a 7–5 record and a 3.95 earned-run average in 19 games.|$|E

5000|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of centers for a football team has increased, due to the re-emergence of 3-4 defenses. According to Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome, [...] "you need to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> who can neutralize that nose tackle. If you don't, everything can get screwed up. Your running game won't be effective and you'll also <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> in your quarterback's face on every play." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is very strange," [...] said Ribby, [...] "I did {{not think}} I left that drawer pulled out; <b>has</b> <b>somebody</b> been trying on my mittens?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Had</b> <b>somebody</b> {{suddenly}} arisen {{from the}} dead before him, Dave {{would have been no}} more astonished than he was when he beheld the Frenchman, who, in the past, had caused him and his relatives so much trouble.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} will--when we {{get enough of}} a crowd against him. I more than half believe he is totally alone, {{although}} the furniture and other stuff {{look as if he}} had <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> to help him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} good,' replied Nicholas hastily; 'but I think {{perhaps it would}} be better if I <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> of my own size at first, in case I should turn out awkward. I should feel more at home, perhaps.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{will play}} Ruth?" [...] she asked. [...] "You must <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> wonderful. It needs a tremendously clever woman. Did Mr. Cracknell say {{anything}} about that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, thank you, docta! But you can undastand, can't you, how I shall want to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> {{around that}} can undastand a little English?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "O, I {{should not}} dare to go," [...] said Jane, {{shaking her head}} with a very serious air. [...] "I should not dare to go at all, unless I <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> {{to take care of}} me bigger than Rollo." ...|$|E
60|$|The little whipper-snapper {{poked his}} nose into the cuddy, {{and pretended to}} be nearly {{overcome}} by the odor of the place, therefore he sent the marines below to overturn everything in the bunks, as if believing we <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> hidden there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, I'm rich,' said Maisie. 'I've {{got three}} hundred a year all my own when I'm twenty-one. That's why Mrs. Jennett is kinder {{to me than}} she is to you. I wish, though, that I <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> that belonged to me,--just a father or a mother.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whatever happens," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "you won't fail me. I'm often {{frivolous}} and selfish, but it's {{nice to know}} I <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> I can trust." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it is that he expects, or why he should {{interfere}} at all. I can't bear to be interfered with. What does he know about it? He has <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> to pay everything for him half-a-dozen times, but I have to look out for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he wanted}} to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw," [...] pursued the woman, [...] "why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he'd have <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{wonderful}} how strong the youth felt, {{now that he}} <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> besides himself to protect. It is said that nature fits the back to the burden, and {{it must have been}} so in this case. For himself, he might have feared to face Yellow Elk single-handed; defending Nellie he would, if called upon, have faced a dozen redskins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. It won't do {{any harm}} <b>having</b> <b>somebody</b> examine it who knows {{a bit about}} these things. Now, what shall we do. Go on the river?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "P'r'aps if 'e <b>'ad</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>somebody</b> {{to leave}} it to 'e wouldn't 'ave 'ad so much to leave," [...] {{observed}} Mr. Kybird, sagely; [...] "it's a rum world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't she hump herself, when {{we showed}} her that advertisement? She was jest like a terrier after a rat, an' bossed me 'round till, as true's you live, I run more'n half {{the way over}} to Mr. McArthur's. Then how she jumped on him when he begun to ask questions! If I only <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> like aunt Dorcas {{to look out for}} me, I wouldn't have to work so hard." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they walked}} off again, quite as happily {{as if they}} had just stepped out of a snug little house of their own, to look for lodgings on account of {{somebody}} else. Tom's simplicity was unabated, Heaven knows; but now that he <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> to rely upon him, he was stimulated to rely a little more upon himself, and was, in his own opinion, quite a desperate fellow.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the moment}} when I looked round {{something}} stirred in the front room. The movement let the light in suddenly through the small open space left by the partially closed door. <b>Had</b> <b>somebody</b> been watching me through the chink? I stepped softly to the door, and pushed it back until it was wide open. There was the Major, discovered in the front room! I saw it in his face--he had been watching me at the book-case! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down a moment," [...] {{he said to}} her. [...] "I must {{telephone}} to <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> take that car, or it'll stay there {{the rest of the}} winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some one-- I'd like to {{find out}} about coming here to live--to see the place, and so on. Can you <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> show me one of the rooms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> in a cradle,' {{she said}} almost tartly, 'and {{you are the}} littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house.' ...|$|R
