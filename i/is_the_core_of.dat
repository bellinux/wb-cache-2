5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E

5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{proposed}} to hold all sporting events {{within the city}} limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would {{be held in the}} cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible. The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park. The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main Press Centre (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the project and includes the largest number of competition venues. A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios. There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC. The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an Olympic Village Training Center, an Olympic Village Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and team officials, including accredited additional officials.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire {{in the form of a}} lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E
