5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E

After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> the theft, that {{is believed to}} show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty {{the night of the}} heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) gets a {{surprise}} {{phone call from}} her ex-boyfriend, Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), who says he will be coming to New York and wants {{to have dinner with}} her. She begins to hope that the two can get back together, however, while watching The Today Show she discovers that he is getting married to a woman named Kaitlin (Kristin McGee). Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), warns her not to attempt revenge; nevertheless, Liz invites Floyd to a seafood restaurant where she had food poisoning on three separate occasions. He does not get food poisoning, but instead, Floyd, a recovering alcoholic, gets drunk off of the whiskey-based fish sauce. The two get into an argument, and after Floyd insults her, Liz leaves the restaurant. The next day, Floyd appears on The Today Show, but still drunk <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> refuses to leave the 30 Rock building. Liz apologizes to both Floyd and Kaitlin for getting him drunk. They accept the apology, and Kaitlin asks Liz to be a participant in their wedding, to which she agrees.|$|E
5|$|Upon the title's creation, CZW {{recognized}} Derek Domino as {{the first}} CZW Iron Man Champion on February 13, 1999 at their Opening Night event. Domino immediately had to defend the title that night against Lobo, {{who went on to}} win the match and the championship. On June 10, 2000 at CZW's Caged To The End event, Mad Man Pondo defeated Wifebeater to win the championship. However, on July 22, 2000 at CZW's No Rules, No Limits event, Wifebeater was awarded the championship without facing Pondo in a match for unknown reasons. Instead, that night Wifebeater defended the title against Nick Gage, who {{went on to win the}} title. During Lobo's third reign CZW held their Breakaway Brawl show on June 9, 2001. A Triple Threat Deathmatch for the CZW Iron Man Championship occurred involving Nick Mondo, Wifebeater, and Mad Man Pondo, which Mondo won to become champion. Lobo was not involved due to a broken leg injury he sustained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

With 19 seconds remaining in overtime, Max Pacioretty scored the game-winning goal and the Predators fell 2–1. Two nights later on January 5 in Tampa, Florida, Colton Sissons led a high-scoring attack with his first career hat trick and goals from Ellis, Fisher and Forsberg in a 6–1 Predators victory over the Lightning. The next night in Sunrise, Florida, the Predators failed to build on their high-scoring victory <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> as Smith scored their only goal in a 2–1 loss to the Florida Panthers. Traveling up to Chicago on January 8, the Predators – being without top scorers Arvidsson, Neal, Subban and Wilson the entire road trip – mustered only two goals by Ekholm and Watson in a 5–2 loss to the Blackhawks.|$|E

There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot.

500|$|The first ballot on Tuesday morning, June 8, saw {{two major}} {{breaks in the}} voting.

Garfield [...] "challenge the correctness of the announcement", claiming that without his consent, {{he should not be}} receiving votes. Hoar dismissed Garfield's question, claiming later that he denied Garfield because {{he did not want to}} see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order, meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy. After the ballot, the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant, 275 for Blaine, 107 for Sherman, and 17 for Garfield. In the thirty-fifth ballot, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana announced that his state would shift all twenty-seven of its votes (mostly coming from the Blaine column) to Garfield.
