40|$|The {{first study}} {{in a series}} {{concerned}} with the costs of different strategies of maternity care showed {{the differences between the}} costs of booked <b>confinement</b> at <b>home,</b> in a GP hospital for 48 hours, and in a consultant obstetric unit for 48 hours to be small. The study costed 1977 <b>home</b> <b>confinements</b> in Dudley and compared them with matched samples of hospital births. The factors that compensated, in the home booked deliveries, for the cost of hospital stay were an average of 11 extra visits from community midwives, midwife attendance for six hours at delivery, and a proportion who were transferred to hospital after receiving the extra antenatal care of a home booked delivery. This differential transfer rate is a crucial factor that merits further investigation. Family-borne costs were included in the study. The most significant was time off work by the husband. Average family costs were 68 pounds, about 30 % of public sector costs. Any acceptable strategy of <b>home</b> <b>confinements</b> must provide for last-minute transfers to hospital...|$|R

An outbreak investigation was carried out including all babies, their respective mothers and workers in the home to determine {{the source of the}} outbreak and to institute control measures. Based on a working case definition of febrile illness with or without diarrhoea, 11 out of the 13 babies in the <b>confinement</b> <b>home</b> met the case definition. One hundred percent had symptoms of fever. 36. 4 % had symptoms of diarrhea and other respiratory conditions respectively. The attack rate of among babies in the <b>confinement</b> <b>home</b> was 90 %. Echovirus 11 was isolated from 3 out of the 11 febrile cases. Echovirus 11 was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid and stool of another baby at a private hospital that was epidemiologically linked to the first case. In conclusion, the outbreak of febrile illness amongst newborn babies in the affected <b>confinement</b> <b>home</b> was due to echovirus 11. The source was probably health-care associated with efficient transmission within the <b>confinement</b> <b>home.</b> The faecal-oral route was the most likely mode of transmission. KEYWORDS...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{necessary}} elements in an obstetric system of <b>home</b> <b>confinements</b> is well-organized postnatal home care. In The Netherlands home care assistants assist midwives during home delivery, they care for the new mother {{as well as the}} newborn baby, instruct the family on infant health care and carry out household duties. The growing demand for postnatal home care is difficult to meet; this has resulted in a short supply of the most popular day care programme and a level of provision which does not result in adequate services. This study acknowledges the patient perspective of maternity home care in order to contribute to its organization. The majority (79 %) of service centres were willing to participate. A total of 1812 (81 %) women who recently gave birth to a child responded to a postal questionnaire addressing the quality of care according to five dimensions: availability, continuity, interpersonal relationships, outcome and assistant's expertise. Almost one-third of the new mothers rated the availability as inadequate while the assistant's expertise was rated positively. Postnatal maternity home care is personalized, small-scale, and recognizes childbirth as a life event. Furthermore, it is relatively inexpensive and contributes to the satisfaction of recipients.

40|$|Populations of feral (not {{owned by}} humans) and {{domestic}} cats Felis catus coexist in most inhabited islands, {{and they have}} similar impacts on native species. Feral cats are generally believed to vary their diet according to prey availability; however, no previous studies of diet have tested this hypothesis on insular ecosystems with a limited range of available prey. Because domestic cats kill prey independently of hunger, the spatial extent of their impact on wildlife will be influenced by home-range size. In this study, we combined dietary information with cat movements to assess the impacts of feral and domestic cats on island biodiversity. We quantified the diet of cats from scat samples collected across one year and tested whether diet varies by season. The abundance of main prey categories was also estimated to document seasonal variation in prey availability for cats. Finally, we tracked domestic cats by global positioning system units in all four seasons to examine whether home-range patterns varied seasonally. The diet of cats constituted three prey groups (rodents, birds and invertebrates), and the seasonal variation in consumption of each taxon matched the seasonal variation in prey availability, thus supporting the generalist behaviour of cats on oceanic islands. Roaming behaviour varied among individuals and across seasons, but could not be explained by availability of prey. Unconfined cats had larger home-ranges than confined cats, but most domestic cats strayed < 1 [*]km from <b>home.</b> Thus, <b>confinement</b> of domestic cats might reduce the spatial extent of cat impact on native prey populations on oceanic islands.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine prevalence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), to determine all-cause health care resource utilization and all-cause health care expenditures, to determine incremental health care resource utilization, and to determine incremental health care expenditures associated with ADPKD. An observational database analysis of a privately insured population was conducted using information from a large administrative claims database. Individuals 18 years of age or older and enrolled in a tracked health plan anytime during the period from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, were eligible for inclusion in the sample for determination of ADPKD prevalence. To select the sample for estimating all-cause and incremental resource utilization and expenditures associated with ADPKD, administrative claims and enrollment records from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 were examined to select individuals 18 years or older with ADPKD (n= 3, 844) based on ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis codes. ADPKD patients were linked one-to-one on age and gender with individuals without ADPKD resulting in 3, 844 persons in the comparison group and a total of 7, 688 persons in the overall sample. ^ The number of individuals with ADPKD enrolled anytime during the period from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, was identified and divided by the total population of covered individuals 18 years or older, during the same one year period to calculate prevalence of ADPKD. All-cause heath care resource utilization among individuals with ADPKD were estimated by counting the total number of hospitalizations, hospital days, nursing <b>home</b> <b>confinements,</b> nursing <b>home</b> days, outpatient visits and emergency room visits. All-cause heath care expenditures among individuals with ADPKD were estimated by summing standard price amounts from claims related to hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient services, emergency rooms, and prescription services. Incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures associated with ADPKD were estimated using regression models, adjusting for other risk factors including age, gender, comorbidities, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and geographical region. ^ The prevalence of autosomal dominant PKD was one in 1, 786 persons or 560 cases per million population. The 95 percent confidence interval for estimated prevalence was 1, 742 to 1, 833. Mean annual unadjusted resource utilization of hospital days 2. 0 versus 0. 45, and outpatient visits 21. 1 versus 9. 7 was substantially higher among persons with ADPKD as compared to persons without ADPKD. Mean annual unadjusted total expenditures $ 23, 242 versus $ 6, 230, mean hospital expenditures $ 6, 646 versus $ 1, 484, mean outpatient expenditures $ 12, 625 versus $ 3, 225, and mean medication expenditures $ 3, 537 versus $ 1, 380, were also higher among ADPKD patients as compared to individuals without ADPKD. Multivariate regression models adjusting for risk factors revealed incremental mean (standard error) resource use associated with ADPKD of 0. 68 (0. 090) hospital days, equal to 68 additional hospital days per 100 ADPKD patients, and 6. 9 (0. 28) outpatient visits, equal to 690 additional visits per 100 ADPKD patients. Mean (standard error) incremental total expenditures associated with PKD were $ 7, 917 ($ 431). Mean incremental expenditures were largest for outpatient expenditures at $ 4, 507 ($ 181), followed by mean incremental hospital expenditures of $ 2, 385 ($ 241), and mean incremental medication expenditures of $ 1, 456 ($ 71). Based on sub-group analysis by whether diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, mean incremental total expenditures were $ 3, 053 ($ 374) among ADPKD patients without end-stage renal disease. ^ In conclusion, ADPKD was associated with considerable incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures. Significant illness burden was found even before patients reached end-stage renal disease. ...|$|R

40|$|Every year {{hundreds}} of thousands of troubled and troublesome children experience out-of-home placements {{under the auspices of the}} mental health, juvenile justice, and child welfare systems. The annual rates of such placements were higher at the end of the twentieth century thanat any time since comprehensive data were first available in the 1920 s. Decades of legislative reform have failed to achieve overall reductions in use of institutions and other out-of-home placements for troubled and troublesome youth. What has changed, however, is the way in which these failures manifest. In recent years, for example, thousands of parents have relinquished custody of their children to the child welfare and juvenile justice systems after unsuccessful attempts to access appropriate mental health services. Hospitals report startling increases in the number of children brought to emergency rooms for behavioral problems. Large numbers of youth have run away or been ejected from their homes because of unresolved emotional or family problems. Admissions of youth to mental hospitals have continued to rise, despite hospital down-sizing and implementation of managed-care policies. This Article examines and challenges our legal system 2 ̆ 7 s conventional patterns of response to troubled and troublesome youth. Reform efforts have ignored the overlap in the populations served by the primary youth service and intervention systems, and have continued to employ narrow system-specific constructions of the problems triggering legal intervention. These efforts have failed to respond effectively to the underlying needs of these youth, their families, and their communities. Thus, not surprisingly, unintended consequences¿ including increased use of one or more alternative institutional systems¿plague deinstitutionalization efforts. In response to today 2 ̆ 7 s manifestations of crises involving troubled and troublesome youth, policymakers are continuing to recycle the ineffective solutions of the past. These ineffective policies rely on strategies of removal (of children from their <b>homes</b> and communities), <b>confinement</b> (in residential facilities and institutions), and exclusion (from the mainstream of society).
