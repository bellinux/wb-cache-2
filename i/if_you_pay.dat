500|$|Despite the {{controversy}} surrounding the game, it was approved for release in Germany and Australia, countries that are known to ban explicit video games. Producer John Williamson stated in an interview, [...] "I thought, just based on everything I always read online, {{that it would never}} get through, but it went through on the first pass." [...] Williamson attempted to justify the release of the game by noting the intellectual elements of both the game and the film franchise. He pointed out: I think they reviewed the game based on everything that was in it, not just on a couple of minutes of it, just like the Saw movies themselves aren't really pure torture porn. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention, there's actually usually a big twist in them. He went on to comment that the Saw films would not continue to appeal to fans if they were stereotypical torture porn.|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2006, {{three days}} before the auction of the final 1,000 pixels was due to end, Tew {{received}} an e-mail from an organisation called [...] "The Dark Group", and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) if a ransom of $5,000 was not paid by 10 January. Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$." [...] Again, he ignored the threat, and the website was flooded with extra traffic and e-mails, causing it to crash. [...] "I haven't replied to any of them as I don't want to give them the satisfaction and I certainly don't intend to pay them any money. What is happening to my website is like terrorism. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> them, new attacks will start," [...] Tew said.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire {{to know what was going}} to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. When you talk to real voters, not the insiders, they care <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E
