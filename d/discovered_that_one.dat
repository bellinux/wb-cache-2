This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when it was <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of}} the WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not come down. Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{three weeks}} later in China, with the lead-in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA rejected the protest, and with Mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged, Nico Rosberg took his – and the team's – first pole position since their return to Formula One in , while a penalty to Lewis Hamilton for a gearbox change promoted Michael Schumacher to second on the grid. Schumacher would ultimately retire from the race {{after the first round}} of stops when it was <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of his wheels had not been attached properly. Rosberg took an early lead in the race, and while his attempt to complete the race with only two pit stops came under threat from second-placed Jenson Button, a mistake by Button's pit crew during his final stop handed Rosberg a nineteen-second advantage over Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen was attempting a similar two-stop strategy, but his tyres wore out seven laps {{from the end of the}} race, and he lost eleven positions in a single lap. This forced Rosberg to drive conservatively to preserve his tyres while Button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass Sebastian Vettel for second. Button was held up by the incumbent World Champion long enough for Rosberg to preserve his tyres, and he became the 103rd person to win a Grand Prix. The result was also Mercedes's first win as a constructor since Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Button was second, with Hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place, giving him a two-point championship lead over Button; Fernando Alonso, who had been leading the championship before the race, finished ninth. After two retirements in the opening rounds of the championship, Romain Grosjean scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth.|$|E

25|$|As Geldof {{began to}} learn more about the situation, he <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of {{repayments}} on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks.

25|$|The {{following}} year, the Scots Greys {{were once}} again in the field under Marlborough. With the French armies pressing the Alliance, Marlborough's forces had to remain in the Low Countries. The French armies were manoeuvring to fight a battle {{that would allow them to}} dictate terms for a peace treaty. The two armies met near Ramillies on 23 May 1706. During the battle, the Scots Greys, serving in Lord Hays' brigade of dragoons, forced their way into the village of Autre Eglise, routing the French infantry defending the village. After passing through the village, the Scots Greys encountered French and quickly defeated the Régiment du Roi. The French quickly surrendered, with the Scots Greys capturing their colours. It was also at this battle that the Scots Greys <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of its troopers was more than he appeared.

The guard was removed and the attack continued. B11 then had to pass under five rows of mines through then uncharted currents. Passing through the minefield took about five hours. After B11 hit Mesûdiye it took eight hours for the submarine to escape initially with any attempt to use the periscope resulting in heavy fire.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} (a {{condition in}} which the body contains excess amounts of cortisol) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing abdominal surgery. They <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of cortisone to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and insulin. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Blair married Cherie Booth, a Roman Catholic, {{who would}} later become a Queen's Counsel, on 29 March 1980. They have four children: Euan, Nicholas, Kathryn, and Leo. Leo, {{delivered}} by the Royal Surgeon/Gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years – since Francis Russell was born to Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849. Blair was criticised when it was <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> child had received private tuition from staff at Westminster School. All four children have Irish passports, by virtue of Blair's mother, Hazel Elizabeth Rosaleen Corscaden (1923–1975).

The bad day which was to unfold for the Australians began with a square cut from Rahul Dravid on the first ball of the day from Stuart MacGill. He had taken 386 balls for the milestone. After reaching his double hundred, Dravid continue in fine nick, cover driving a ball from Gillespie to extra cover boundary for four, going past Ravi Shastri's record for the highest score in Australia against Australia by an Indian.
