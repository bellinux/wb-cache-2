40|$|Nowadays, {{search on}} the Web {{goes beyond the}} {{retrieval}} of textual Web sites and increasingly {{takes advantage of the}} growing amount of structured data. Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in different sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called "uncooperative". Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of <b>federated</b> <b>entity</b> search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-fly through entity consolidation performed at query time. We propose a novel method for entity consolidation that is based on using language models and completely unsupervised, hence more suitable for this on-the-fly uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods that require training data. Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from different sources. Particular novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking. We perform experiments using real Web queries and data sources. Our experiments show that our approach for <b>federated</b> <b>entity</b> search with on-the-fly consolidation improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art preference aggregation baseline and also benefits from consolidation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

Para tanto, dividiu-se a pesquisa em seis partes. Destas, as duas primeiras servem para, em linhas gerais, assentar os aspectos introdutórios da pesquisa e delimitar as noções conceituais adotadas. Segue-se para o enfrentamento das três hipóteses de pesquisa, cada uma em capítulo próprio, vislumbradas a partir do texto constitucional como inicialmente aptas a ordenar a distribuição da competência legislativa entre os entes federados para a edição das normas de contratos administrativos. Na primeira, discute-se, com base no artigo 22, XXVII, da Constituição de 1988, se caberia à União Federal, autorizada pelo termo contratação, estabelecer normas gerais sobre contratos administrativos, competindo aos Estados-membros, Distrito Federal e Municípios, suplementarem aquelas, para atenderem às suas peculiaridades. Outra, constante do artigo 22, I, da Constituição de 1988, admitiria à União Federal legislar integralmente sobre a matéria, com fundamento na sua competência para estabelecer normas em matéria de Direito civil, ramo no qual a categoria jurídica dos contratos tem assento tradicional. A última hipótese, por sua vez, decorrente do artigo 18, caput, da Constituição de 1988, não atribuiria a nenhum ente federado a competência específica para legislar sobre o tema dos contratos administrativos, relacionando esta matéria ao campo próprio da autonomia dos entes federados. A despeito dessa liberdade para legislar, pondera-se, no exame desta hipótese e pela perspectiva da distribuição de competências entre os entes federados, quanto à existência de outros limites constitucionais, aptos a restringir a autonomia dos entes federados no uso dos contratos administrativos. Ao final, retomam-se, em sede de conclusão, as hipóteses formuladas e as considerações apontadas sobre cada uma delas ao longo do trabalho, apontando-se aquela que se entende mais adequada à estrutura federativa do Estado brasileiro. This thesis probes on {{the limits}} that the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 sets to the {{autonomy}} of federated entities {{in regards to the}} distribution of the legislative competence in matter of government contracts. The research was divided in six parts. The first two have the purpose of laying out an introduction of the study as well as the concepts employed. Afterwards, the three hypotheses are confronted, each in a paragraph of their own, perceived as from the constitutional text as initially able to ordain the distribution of legislative competence between the federated entities to regulate government contracts. On the first, it is argued, based on the article 22, XXVII, of the Federal Constitution of 1988, if it would behoove the Federal Union, authorized by the term contracting, to establish general rules on government contracts, competing to the Member-States, Federal District and Municipalities to supplement those, in order to attend their peculiarities. Another understanding, found in the article 22, I, of the Federal Constitution of 1988, would allow the Federal Union to fully legislate on the matter, grounded on its competence to establish rules in Civil Law, branch in which the legal category of contracts have a traditional place. The last theory, on its turn, consequent to the article 18, caput, of the Federal Constitution of 1988, would not assign to any <b>federated</b> <b>entity</b> the specific competence to legislate on government contracts, relating this theme to the proper field of autonomy of federated entities. In spite of this freedom to legislate, it is considered, in the exam of this hypothesis and from the perspective of distribution of competence between federated entities, in regards of the existence of other constitutional limits, able to restrain {{the autonomy of}} federated entities in the use of government contracts. Finally, it is resumed, in terms of conclusion, the hypotheses formulated and the considerations that were put forth in each of them through the project, pointing out the one understood as the most adequate to the federative structure of the Brazilian State...|$|E

It discusses {{the relations between the}} federal government and the <b>federated</b> <b>entities</b> in Belgium. It addresses two questions. Firstly, what is the impact of European integration on the relations between {{the federal government and the}} <b>federated</b> <b>entities</b> in Belgium and secondly, does European integration strengthen or rather weaken the role of federal government towards regions and communities. In particular, it argues that the combination of two parallel processes - on the one hand, the deepening of European integration and on the other hand, the domestic devolution of powers in Belgium - resulted in a situation where the position of the federal government is strengthened despite the constant pressure of federated units on decentralization. Using Germany and Austria as typical cases of federations to compare, the thesis assumes that Belgium is an exceptional case of federation. While in Austria and Germany the European integration consolidates the existing relations between federal government and <b>federated</b> <b>entities,</b> in Belgium it completely changes them.

40|$|Políticas públicas educacionais, com o objetivo de inserir tecnologias digitais nas escolas públicas têm sido implementadas, a partir da década de 1980, em tese, a partir de um regime de cooperação e colaboração, que tem envolvido todos os níveis de governo - estadual, {{municipal}} e federal -, indústrias, empresas, escolas e universidades. Até o século XX, estas políticas eram materializadas com a implantação de laboratórios de informática, onde era disponibilizado até 20 computadores por instituição. A partir do século XXI, o governo federal começou a comprar e distribuir dispositivos móveis, como laptop e tablets. O que temos observado na implementação dessas políticas é a ausência de diálogo – entre Ministério da Educação, escolas e universidades - que desencadeia insuficiências nos projetos e programas, quanto a problemas de infraestrutura das escolas, limitações de hardware e software nos equipamentos e a velocidade insuficiente da internet, o que tem impactado diretamente nas atividades propostas/desenvolvidas nesse cotidiano. Dessa situação, brotaram nossas questões de pesquisa: quais as possibilidades de articulação entre as instâncias de governo, responsáveis por essa política, e destas com as empresas, universidades e escolas envolvidas nesse processo? As responsabilidades previstas, definidas no Projeto para cada ente federado, para implementação das suas ações estão sendo observadas? Existem relações com políticas públicas em áreas afins para fortalecimento e execução das ações pensadas para inserção das tecnologias nas escolas? Se existem, como elas acontecem? Trata-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa. Para construção das informações no campo, optamos por entrevistas, observações e pesquisa documental. A amostra foi composta por dez escolas do Estado da Bahia, participantes da fase piloto de um Projeto do governo federal, denominado Um Computador por Aluno (UCA). Dentre os resultados, destacamos: essas ações tem se constituído como política de governo e não de Estado; não há relações com políticas em áreas afins; apesar de estados e municípios terem firmado termo de cooperação técnica para implementação do Projeto, as insuficiências desses entes, no que tange a recursos financeiros, possivelmente compromete a efetivação do que foi pactuado. ABSTRACT Educational {{public policies}} {{with the purpose}} of inserting digital technologies in public school's everyday have been implemented from the 1980 s, in theory, from a regime of cooperation and collaboration, which has involved all levels of government - state, municipal and federal -, industries, companies, schools and universities. Until the twentieth century, these policies were materialized through the installation of computer labs, in which were available up to 20 computers per institution. From the twenty-first century, the federal government started buying and distributing mobile devices such as laptops and tablets. We have been observing, in the implementation of this policies, that {{there is a lack of}} dialogue - between the Ministry of Education, Schools and Universities - which triggers insufficiences in the projects and programs, regarding problems related to the schools‟ infrastructure, hardware and software limitations in the equipments, and the insufficient internet speed, which has directly impacted in the activities proposed and developed in this routine. From this situation, sprouted our research questions: What are the possibilities of coordination between levels of government, responsible for this policy, and those with companies, universities and schools involved in this process? The responsibilities foreseen, defined in the Project for each <b>federated</b> <b>entity</b> to implement their actions are being observed? Are there relationships with public policy in related areas for strengthening and execution of actions designed for insertion of technology in schools? If there are, how do they happen? This is a qualitative research, the nature of the study is focused on critical ethno-research. To the construction of information in the field, we chose interviews, observations and documentary research. The sample was consisted of all the schools in the State of Bahia, the participants of a project of the federal government in its pilot phase, known as Um Computador por Aluno (UCA). Among the results, we highlight: these actions have been established as government policy and not State; there are no relations with policy in related areas; despite of the state and municipalities enter into technical cooperation agreement for implementation of the Project, the shortcomings of these entities, in which refers to financial resources, possibly compromise the realization of what was agree...|$|E

The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited {{in this kind of}} systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details.

40|$|The {{paper is}} divided in three sections. In the first section, I {{question}} {{the use of}} the statist redistributive paradigm in federalism. In the second section, I argue that efficiency is a moral principle and that it has a strong normative appeal, especially in contexts of diversity. I show that adopting efficiency as a guiding principle to think {{of the role of the}} state, especially in contexts of pluralism, as in MNF, allows us to consider the division of competences in a way that is yet unexplored in political philosophy. Furthermore, I argue that embracing efficiency allows us to avoid the moral problems that other moral approaches encounter, especially as I will defend a non-utilitarian conception of efficiency. That also allows me to show that if one opts for the view that pictures federalism as an efficiency maximizing enterprise, it does not lead to a libertarian conception of federalism. Finally, I try to briefly sketch a possible connection between the principle of efficiency and republican ideal of ‘non-domination’ (Pettit 2012). More specifically I suggest that the pursuit of ‘non-domination’ is totally compatible with the pursuit of efficiency in MNF. In other words, the federal government can interfere to resolve government failures at the sub-unit level, for instance externalities, without being or becoming a dominating agent. The ideal of non-domination supports the sort of strong government interventions defended by egalitarians without having to compromise on the autonomy of <b>federated</b> <b>entities.</b> The combination of efficiency and non-domination ends with a defense of asymmetrical federal arrangements, without sacrificing the equality that states ought to preserve...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, after {{pointing}} out the different logics that lie behind the familiar ideas of democracy and federalism, I {{have dealt with the}} case of plurinational federal democracies. Having put forward a double criterion of an empirical nature with which to differentiate between the existence of minority nations within plurinational democracies (section 2), I suggest three theoretical criteria for the political accommodation of these democracies. In the following section, I show the agonistic nature of the normative discussion of the political accommodation of this kind of democracies, which bring monist and pluralist versions of the demos of the polity into conflict (section 3. 1), {{as well as a number}} of conclusions which are the result of a comparative study of 19 federal and regional democracies using four analytical axes: the uninational/plurinational axis; the unitarianism-federalism axis; the centralisation-decentralisation axis; and the symmetry-asymmetry axis (section 3. 2). This analysis reveals shortcomings in the constitutional recognition of national pluralism in federal and regional cases with a large number of federated units/regions with political autonomy; a lower degree of constitutional federalism and a greater asymmetry in the <b>federated</b> <b>entities</b> or regions of plurinational democracies. It also reveals difficulties to establish clear formulas in these democracies in order to encourage a “federalism of trust” based on the participation and protection of national minorities in the shared government of plurinational federations/regional states. Actually, there is a federal deficit in this kind polities according to normative liberal-democratic patterns and to what comparative analysis show. Finally, this chapter advocates the need for a greater normative and institutional refinement in plurinational federal democracies. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to introduce a deeper form of “ethical” pluralism -which displays normative agonistic trends, as well as a more “confederal/asymmetrical” perspective, congruent with the national pluralism of these kind of polities...|$|R

40|$|Every {{decentralized}} {{state has}} got the problems about {{the relationships between the}} different institutional levels. One kind of relationships can be expressed by the Senate but in some decentralized States the Second Chamber is no longer perceived as an effective mechanism of representation of the regional (or <b>federated)</b> <b>entities.</b> Therefore, the intestate federalism can be preferred to intrastate federalism, increasing the role of government branch as to legislative assemblies. The co-operation among institutional levels gives birth to a tight network of relation between the different levels of government and is substantiated with a variety of involved actors and concrete procedures. To have a classification of these relations, the doctrine referred to institutional and functional cooperation. The first drove to the creation of some organs that gather both state bodies and regional and local ones. The “State-Regions” Conference is a significant example together with the Conferencias sectoriales in Spain or the Joint committee in the U. K. Hereafter our attention will move to the co-operation forms between government levels from which acts and procedures arise. Such acts and procedures are a result of the meeting between the different representatives of the administrations. This helps to speed the administrative process and to improve, then, the public performance quality. For instance we can cite the Austrian öffentlich-rechtliche Verträge In conclusion, I’d like to underline two points: one: there is an increase of intergovernmental relationships in the decentralized States. This trend can be explained with the reason to give the regional level a collective voice in the national policy process, especially, where no regional second chambers exist. The second point is: the institutions of intergovernmental relationships are clearly important for the development of coherent policy but it can reduce the legislative role. The intergovernmental institutions operate in a space between the region and the Member state levels and as the decisions reached are a compromise between executives, neither the member state parliament nor the regional legislature will responsible for the decisions taken.

Similarly, the commercial marketplace today is a global one, requiring the exchange of information in support of transactions on an international scale. Traditionally, federated secure information sharing has been accomplished through bi- and multi-lateral information exchange agreements that require complex, human-centric and timeintensive processes to stand up or modify. The objective vision is to support such information sharing by establishing domain functional areas, and by creating discovery metadata standards that leverage security information to filter published data sets.

40|$|Throughout the {{successive}} {{phases of the}} Belgian state reform, powers were increasingly devolved from federal level to the communities and regions. The present article deals with the revenues and expenditure of the communities and regions. The article also contains {{an analysis of the}} changes in the financing balance and debt level. Finally, the results of the projections regarding the movement in community and regional finances are also highlighted. The analysis concerns both the communities and regions as a whole, and the individual <b>federated</b> <b>entities.</b> In order to eliminate the influence of institutional differences and compare more uniform entities, a distinction is also made between the north and south of the country. The past decade has seen a systematic improvement in the financing balance of the communities and regions. The explanation for this improving trend {{lies in the fact that}} the real rate of growth in their primary expenditure was lower than the growth of their revenues. Revenues in fact increased sharply. During the so-called transitional period which ended in 1999, the special mechanisms provided under the Finance Act indeed contributed towards a very steep increase in the funds allocated in respect of personal income tax. As regards the part of personal income tax allocated to the communities and regions, the gradual switch to an allocation formula based on the proceeds of the personal income tax collected in each entity caused the Finance Act funding to rise faster in the north than in the south. Since revenues have grown faster than expenditure over the past ten years in each entity – with expenditure rising by more in the north than in the south of the country – all the communities and regions succeeded in achieving an improvement in their financing balance. In order to achieve the target of a balanced budget in 2010, set by the High Council of Finance, the increase in expenditure for the communities and regions as a whole must not outpace GDP growth. The permissible expenditure growth will probably not be the same for each individual entity. In the north, expenditure can increase by slightly more than in the south, partly because the north has scope for gradually reducing its surplus, while in the south the deficits – albeit small – need to be eliminated. public finance, fiscal devolution, Belgian administrative reform, Finance Act, communities and regions...|$|R
