5|$|Domestic mammals form a {{large part}} of the {{livestock}} raised for meat across the world. They include (2011) around 1.4 billion cattle, 1.2 billion sheep, 1 billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700 million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods.|$|E
5|$|Economically, animals {{provide much}} of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of {{mechanised}} transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of}} the power used <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> transport.

5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Giolitti {{acknowledged}} {{the need to}} stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E

The building houses the Department of Health and the Department <b>for</b> <b>Work</b> <b>and</b> Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday Times Magazine hired Chatwin in 1972. He {{travelled}} {{the world}} <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> interviewed {{figures such as}} the politicians Indira Gandhi and André Malraux. He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia, which resulted in his first book. He produced five other books, including The Songlines (1987), which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple, Claudio Magris, Philip Marsden, Luis Sepúlveda, and Rory Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient.

Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E

5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E

5|$|Known as Weolingtun in the Anglo-Saxon period, {{its name}} had changed to Walintone {{by the time}} of the Domesday Book of 1086. Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter. Major {{rebuilding}} took place following a fire in the town in 1731, after which it became a centre for cloth-making. Wellington gave its name to the first Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, who is commemorated by the nearby Wellington Monument. The Grand Western Canal reached the town in 1835 and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1843. The town's own railway station survived until 1964. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales. In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|Today Aarhus {{is at the}} {{cultural}} and economic core {{of the region and}} the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union, and as number 234 among world cities. It is also a top 100 conference city in the world. Aarhus is the principal industrial port of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in Kattegat. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> leisure from a wide area in Region Midtjylland. It is a centre for research and education in the Nordic countries and home to Aarhus University, Scandinavia's largest university, including Aarhus University Hospital and INCUBA Science Park. Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics, with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18, Aarhus is also the second fastest growing Danish city, with an average growth of 4,500 people per annum since 2008.|$|E

Susan and Mike decide to enroll M.J. in private school, and Susan takes a job as an assistant art teacher at the school {{to help pay for the}} tuition. With both Susan and Mike employed, M.J. spends more time under Katherine's care, which makes Susan uneasy.

5|$|William Taylor and Helen Cartwright are two {{children}} {{who live in}} the city of Bellbridge (a fictionalised version of London). Will is an aspiring football player, Helen a prodigy violinist. Over the years, both have grown apart from their respective parents; Helen has chosen to spend more time practising the violin with her friends rather than with her mother, a choice which has begun to fill her with guilt, while Will's father is transferred to another city <b>for</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> leaves his son by himself. Both children suffer nightmares and come under attack by the Nightmaren, who chase them into the world of Nightopia. There, the {{two children}} meet and free Nights, who has the ability to merge with the children, allowing them to share Nights' body and fly through the skies. Learning that Wizeman is plotting to take over the dream world and consequently enter the real world, the children and Nights resolve to stop Wizeman, but face resistance from the Nightmaren he commands, particularly Nights' sibling, Reala.|$|E
