40|$|As new equipment, {{the channel}} wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> has become {{increasingly}} popular in recent years. However, when such equipment is operated under low ambient temperature in the freezing area in winter, the formation of frost on the outdoor waste air surface becomes problematic, leading to the degradation of the channel wheel fresh air ventilator's performance or even the shutdown of equipment. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have a detailed investigation on the operational characteristics of the channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> under frosting in order to guide its application. This paper first reports on the development of a detailed model for the channel wheel heat exchanger, which is the core part of the channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> under frosting conditions. The model developed, first seen in open literature, consists of a frosting sub-model and a channel wheel heat exchanger sub-model. This is followed by reporting an evaluation of the operational characteristics of a frosted channel wheel heat exchanger under different ambient conditions using the model developed. These include frost formation {{on the surface of the}} channel wheel heat exchanger, and impacts on the operational performance of the channel wheel <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Furthermore, the interval of defrosting is obtained, which provides the basis for the adoption of effective defrosting measures, and thus increasing the channel wheel fresh air ventilator's energy efficiency and operating reliability...|$|E

30|$|From LSCs’ perspective, {{there are}} three major {{categories}} of the food supply chain according to temperature control and monitoring: room temperature food, cold food, and frozen food. Each type of food has different requirements in the food supply chain. Room temperature food includes water, biscuits, rice and flour in addition to foods that respond slowly to temperature changes. The temperature for these foods must be maintained at 18  °C. Cold food includes vegetables and fruit and other items that are highly responsive to temperature changes. The temperature for such foods must be maintained at 0  °C to + 7  °C. Frozen food includes meat and fish in addition to foods that respond slowly to temperature changes. The temperature for such foods must be maintained at − 18  °C. In the transportation of frozen food, the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>ventilators</b> must always be closed and the humidity indicator {{should be in the}} OFF position. Temperature is an important parameter in food safety and quality (Montanari, 2008; Ovca and Jevsnik, 2009). During the logistics process, any change in time-distance or temperature may create spoilage or loss of flavour. Thus, temperature needs to be continuously and carefully controlled and monitored at each stage of the food supply chain with adequate control systems, correct placement of temperature sensors and efficient insulation. All perishable products are required to be delivered by a refrigerated loading dock to minimise the increase in product temperature during loading and unloading and to avoid the entrance of moist or warm ambient air.|$|R

The building no longer satisfies OSHA laws and building codes without <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> EPA recommends <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> exchange of no less than 15 cfm/person to prevent accumulation of toxic chemicals in the air, like the carbon dioxide that is exhaled in human breath.

40|$|In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{volume is}} always restricted to save energy, which sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) to some extent. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Therefore, IAQ can be improved by increasing the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduced into an air-conditioning system. In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests. In addition, the proposed system and a conventional system are compared. In the proposed system, {{with the increase in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the heating load for solution regeneration rises, the dehumidification efficiency increases and the regeneration efficiency drops. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %. The results also show that the proposed system can save power notably. The maximum power saving ratio is 58. 9 % when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio is 20 %; however, the ratio drops when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio increases. These findings will be beneficial in the selection of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilation strategies for liquid desiccant based air-conditioning systems.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{office building}} design, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements are estimated for full occupancy in the building. Typically, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements range from 5 to 15 {{cubic feet per}} minute per person expected to occupy the building. While the design total amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> used is satisfactory for full occupancy of the building, there are many instances less than the design occupancy. Thus, there may be many instances in a commercial building where more <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> is used than is actually required because the occupancy is below the design occupancy. In hot and humid climates, such as the Gulf Southwest, a considerable portion of the cooling energy in a commercial building is expended cooling and dehumidifying the air needed to maintain <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> requirements. If {{the total amount of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> could be reduced to just match that needed by the number of occupants in a building, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the energy use for cooling.
