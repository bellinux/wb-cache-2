5|$|Roman {{influence}} {{assisted the}} spread of Christianity throughout Europe, {{but there is little}} evidence of a <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> the Roman Empire and Christian missions north of Hadrian's Wall. Traditionally, Ninian is credited as the first bishop active in Scotland. He is briefly mentioned by Bede who states that around 397 he set up his base at Whithorn in the south-west of Scotland, building a stone church there, known as Candida Casa. More recently {{it has been suggested that}} Ninian was the 6th-century missionary Finnian of Moville, but either way Roman influence on early Christianity in Scotland does not seem to have been significant.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> <b>between</b> proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

30|$|While {{the works}} in [2 – 5, 7] all {{considered}} minimizing the total transmit power of interference networks, another important performance metric, which concerns more {{about the quality of}} communications, is the mean-square-error (MSE) for signal estimation. In [8 – 10], the sum minimum MSE (MMSE) was considered to design iterative algorithms for MIMO interference relay systems taking the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> the source and destination nodes into consideration, and in [11], similar problem has been considered ignoring the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> <b>between</b> the communicating parties. Indeed the <b>direct</b> source-destination <b>links</b> can {{play a vital role in}} wireless communication systems when the link-strength is significant. However, multihop communication is motivated by the fact that such <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> may undergo deep shadowing effects in many practical scenarios. Hence, many existing works on multihop communications have ignored the <b>direct</b> <b>links.</b> Nonetheless, the sum MMSE criterion runs the risk that some of the receivers may suffer from unacceptably high MSEs. Also, {{the works in}} [8 – 10] considered one-way relaying only.|$|R
