500|$|Pacino played Dr <b>Jack</b> <b>Kevorkian</b> in an HBO Films biopic titled You Don't Know Jack, which premiered April 2010.

500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about <b>Jack</b> <b>Kevorkian,</b> as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
500|$|Pacino {{received}} his first Best Actor Oscar nomination for Serpico (1973); {{he was also}} nominated for The Godfather Part II, Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and ...And Justice for All (1979) and won the award in 1993 for his performance as the blind Lieutenant Colonel Slade in Scent of a Woman (1992). For his performances in The Godfather, Dick Tracy (1990) and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), Pacino was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

500|$|Religion {{features}} {{frequently in}} Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced {{a number of}} his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric, and was prone to using such expressions as [...] "God forbid" [...] and [...] "thank God". He once wrote his own version of the Requiem Mass, which he then had translated into Latin and set to music. In God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is euthanized by Dr. <b>Jack</b> <b>Kevorkian.</b> Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including Isaac Asimov, William Shakespeare, and Kilgore Troutâ€”the last a fictional character from several of his novels. Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths, and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in Player Piano, The Sirens of Titan and Cat's Cradle. In The Sirens of Titan, Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. Slaughterhouse-Five sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism.|$|E

The Cartoon Central network in [...] "Death" [...] is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts South Park. John Warsog, the man who runs Cartoon Central in [...] "Death", is based on Doug Herzog, the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing South Park to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal. During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him in a room and plays music by the Irish vocalist Enya as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him. The parody of Enya's Orinoco Flow used in [...] "Death" [...] was sung by Toddy Walters, who played protagonist Polly Pry in Trey Parker's 1996 film, Cannibal! The Musical. [...] "Death" [...] marked the first appearance of Snacky Cakes, one of Cartman's favorite snack foods.|$|E
500|$|Rathbun {{suffered}} from {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and osteoarthritis. She survived colon cancer and walked with artificial knees. [...] Rathbun often self-medicated by consuming half a cannabis brownie {{in the morning}} and another half in the afternoon to ease the pain of osteoarthritis in her knees. [...] She claimed cannabis brownies allowed her to walk and helped her with her gout. By the spring of 1996, Rathbun was in extreme pain and was no longer able to bake. [...] She began losing weight and told Peron that she considered traveling to Michigan for physician-assisted suicide at the hands of <b>Jack</b> <b>Kevorkian.</b> After suffering a fall in August 1998, Rathbun was admitted to Mount Zion Hospital for surgery on her neck and spine. [...] She recovered from the operation at Davies Medical Center, but received few visitors. [...] Later, she was confined to a bed at Laguna Honda Hospital, a nursing home for the poor. [...] Rathbun {{died of a heart attack}} at age 77 on April 10, 1999. [...] On April 17, 300 people, including her friend, district attorney Terence Hallinan, attended a candlelight vigil held in her honor in the Castro. [...] Hallinan told a crowd of several hundred people gathered at her memorial that she was a hero who will [...] "one day be remembered as the Florence Nightingale of the medical marijuana movement." ...|$|E
