40|$|Information from whole-rock trace-element {{compositions}} {{is significant}} for petrological studies. LA-ICP-MS technique can rapidly determine whole-rock trace-element compositions by <b>fused</b> <b>glasses</b> prepared by homogenization of rock powders. As already reported, several trace-element abundance (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, Th and REEs) of basaltic and andesitic rocks {{can be determined}} with high accuracy by the routine measurement on the flux-free <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> using LA-ICP-MS in our laboratory. In this study, based on the previous report, whole-rock trace-element compositions of some Cr-rich rocks, mantle diopsidite and related rocks from the Oman ophiolite, were determined by the routine work. The mantle diopsidite is locally rich in chromite and its <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> prepared includes quench crystals and residual grains of chromite. Here, we assessed the reliability and uncertainty of our data obtained from such incompletely homogenized <b>fused</b> <b>glasses.</b> High precision of 3 -spot analyses supports that quench crystals of chromite were homogeneously distributed in the <b>fused</b> <b>glass.</b> This suggests that the analytical data obtained from spots unrelated to residual chromite grains are reliable for whole-rock trace-element compositions. The heterogeneity caused by residual chromite grains can be ignored in the measurement of incompatible elements (Sr, Y, Zr, and REEs). Our analytical results of 6 <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> beads prepared from the diopsidite samples indicate that heterogeneity of the mantle diopsidite {{in terms of the}} abundance of chromite is scarcely reflected by incompatible-element compositions while the heterogeneity is clearly characterized by Cr abundance...|$|R

30|$|Concentrations of 24 trace {{elements}} (Ba, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ta, Th, U, Y, Zr, and 14 {{rare earth elements}} (REEs)) were analyzed for three USGS GRMs (G- 3 granite, AGV- 2 andesite, and BHVO- 2 basalt). Each analysis for the GRM beads was performed as spot (ca. 55  μm diameter) analysis with 120 -s ablation time. The depth-to-diameter ratio of the laser spot was low (< 4) enough to prevent significant elemental fractionation. The NIST 612 glass and 29 Si were employed as the external standard and the internal standard element, respectively. When the middle half of time-integrated data was taken to minimize the fractionation effect, the low-dilution <b>fused</b> <b>glasses</b> yielded reproducible and accurate results for all analyzed elements. In the case of normal-dilution <b>fused</b> <b>glasses,</b> comparable precision and accuracy were obtained only for elements with concentrations higher than 1  μg g− 1, likely resulting from higher dilution ratios.|$|R
40|$|XRF {{analysis}} of {{major and minor}} elements in silicate rocks using <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> discs at high dilution ratio. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is an accurate, rapid spectroscopic technique for chemical element determinations on rock samples. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate a calibration method for the determination of major and minor elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe) in silicate rocks using <b>fused</b> <b>glass</b> discs with a 1 : 30 sample/borate dilution. The analytical method has been calibrated by using forty-two international rock standards. The accuracy appears acceptable for many mineralogical and petrographic purposes. A high dilution ratio makes possible the use of a small amount of sample (225 mg) to obtain good castings in high-melting materials. By contrast, the decrease of the analytical intensity makes not easy the determination of trace elements at the typical concentration levels of geological samples...|$|R
