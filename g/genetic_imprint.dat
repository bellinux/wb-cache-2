Its asymmetric elevation during contraction correlates with morphological features suggestive of inherent left-right (L/R) asymmetry.

Here, we introduce a framework for detecting the <b>genetic</b> <b>imprint</b> of recent positive selection by analysing long-range haplotypes in human populations. We first identify haplotypes at a locus of interest (core haplotypes). We then assess the age of each core haplotype by the decay of its association to alleles at various distances from the locus, as measured by extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). Core haplotypes that have unusually high EHH and a high population frequency indicate the presence of a mutation that rose to prominence in the human gene pool faster than expected under neutral evolution. We applied this approach to investigate selection at two genes carrying common variants implicated in resistance to malaria: G 6 PD and CD 40 ligand. At both loci, the core haplotypes carrying the proposed protective mutation stand out and show significant evidence of selection. More generally, the method could be used to scan the entire genome for evidence of recent positive selection...|$|E

We conducted simulation studies for both quantitative and qualitative traits to evaluate the performance of the statistical and functional models with different levels of POEs. Our results showed that the newly proposed Stat-POE model, which ensures orthogonality of variance components if Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) or equal minor and major allele frequencies is satisfied, had greater power for detecting the main allelic additive effect than a Func-POE model, which codes according to allelic substitutions, for both quantitative and qualitative traits.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of extravagant sexual traits by sensory exploitation occurs if males incidentally evolve features that stimulate females owing to a pre-existing environmental response that {{arose in the}} context of natural selection. The sensory exploitation process is thus expected to leave a specific <b>genetic</b> <b>imprint,</b> a pleiotropic control of the original environmental response and the novel sexual response in females. However, females may be subsequently selected to improve their discrimination of environmental and sexual stimuli. Accordingly, responses may have diverged and the original genetic architecture may have been modified. These possibilities may be considered by studying the genetic architecture of responses to male signals and to the environmental stimuli that were purportedly 'exploited' by those signals. However, no previous study has addressed the genetic control of sensory exploitation. We investigated this question in an acoustic pyralid moth, Achroia grisella, in which a male ultrasonic song attracts females and perception of ultrasound likely arose {{in the context of}} detecting predatory bats. We examined the genetic architecture of female response to bat echolocation signals and to male song via a cartographic study of quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing these receiver traits. We found several QTL for both traits, but none of them were colocalized on the same chromosomes. These results indicate that - {{to the extent to which}} male A. grisella song originated by the process of sensory exploitation - some modification of the female responses occurred since the origin of the male signal.

Despite this, {{little is known about}} polar bear species history. Future conservation strategies would significantly benefit from an understanding of basic evolutionary information, such as the timing and conditions of their initial divergence from brown bears (U.  arctos) or their response to previous environmental change. ResultsWe used a spatially explicit phylogeographic model to estimate the dynamics of 242 brown bear and polar bear matrilines sampled throughout the last 120, 000 years and across their present and past geographic ranges. Our results show that the present distribution of these matrilines was shaped by a combination of regional stability and rapid, long-distance dispersal from ice-age refugia. In addition, hybridization between polar bears and brown bears may have occurred multiple times throughout the Late Pleistocene. ConclusionsThe reconstructed matrilineal history of brown and polar bears has two striking features. First, it is punctuated by dramatic and discrete climate-driven dispersal events. Second, opportunistic mating between these two species as their ranges overlapped has left a strong <b>genetic</b> <b>imprint.</b> In particular, a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear matriline. This suggests that interspecific hybridization not only may be more common than previously considered but may be a mechanism by which species deal with marginal habitats during periods of environmental deterioration...|$|E

We have investigated the preservation, origin and <b>genetic</b> <b>imprint</b> of extracellular DNA recovered from permanently anoxic deep-sea sediments of the Black Sea. Despite high DNase activities, huge amounts of total extracellular DNA were found in both the surface and sub-surface sediment layers, suggesting reduced availability of the extracellular DNA pool to nuclease degradation. The reduced degradation of the total extracellular DNA was confirmed by its low decay rate and the high accumulation in the deeper sediment layers. The copy numbers of 16 S and 18 S rDNA contained within the extracellular DNA pool in both the surface and sub-surface sediment layers was very high, indicating that permanently anoxic sediments of the deep Black Sea are hot spots of preserved extracellular gene sequences. The extracellular DNA recovered from these sediment layers also contained highly diversified 18 S rDNA sequences. These were not only representative of the major protistan lineages, but also of new very divergent lineages, branching as independent clades {{at the base of}} the tree.

40|$|Abstract Background Broad-scale phylogeographic {{studies of}} {{freshwater}} organisms provide {{not only an}} invaluable framework for understanding the evolutionary history of species, but also a <b>genetic</b> <b>imprint</b> of the paleo-hydrological dynamics stemming from climatic change. Few such studies {{have been carried out}} in Siberia, a vast region over which the extent of Pleistocene glaciation is still disputed. Brachymystax lenok is a salmonid fish distributed throughout Siberia, exhibiting two forms hypothesized to have undergone extensive range expansion, genetic exchange, and multiple speciation. A comprehensive phylogeographic investigation should clarify these hypotheses as well as provide insights on Siberia's paleo-hydrological stability. Results Molecular-sequence (mtDNA) based phylogenetic and morphological analysis of Brachymystax throughout Siberia support that sharp- and blunt-snouted lenok are independent evolutionary lineages, with the majority of their variation distributed among major river basins. Their evolutionary independence was further supported through the analysis of 11 microsatellite loci in three areas of sympatry, which revealed little to no evidence of introgression. Phylogeographic structure reflects climatic limitations, especially for blunt-snouted lenok above 56 ° N during one or more glacial maxima. Presumed glacial refugia as well as interbasin exchange were not congruent for the two lineages, perhaps reflecting differing dispersal abilities and response to climatic change. Inferred demographic expansions were dated earlier than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Evidence for repeated trans-basin exchange was especially clear between the Amur and Lena catchments. Divergence of sharp-snouted lenok in the Selenga-Baikal catchment may correspond to the isolation of Lake Baikal in the mid-Pleistocene, while older isolation events are apparent for blunt-snouted lenok in the extreme east and sharp-snouted lenok in the extreme west of their respective distributions. Conclusion Sharp- and blunt-snouted lenok have apparently undergone a long, independent, and demographically dynamic evolutionary history in Siberia, supporting their recognition as two good biological species. Considering the timing and extent of expansions and trans-basin dispersal, it is doubtful that these historical dynamics could have been generated without major rearrangements in the paleo-hydrological network, stemming from the formation and melting of large-scale glacial complexes much older than the LGM. </p...|$|E

Here, we have analyzed global patterns of allelic gene expression in developing maize endosperms from reciprocal crosses between inbreds B 73 and Mo 17. We have defined an imprinted gene as {{one in which the}} relative expression of the maternal and paternal alleles differ at least fivefold in both hybrids of the reciprocal crosses. We found that at least 179 genes (1. 6 % of protein-coding genes) expressed in the endosperm are imprinted, with 68 of them showing maternal preferential expression and 111 paternal preferential expression. Additionally, 38 long noncoding RNAs were imprinted. The latter are transcribed in either sense or antisense orientation from intronic regions of normal protein-coding genes or from intergenic regions. Imprinted genes show a clear pattern of clustering around the genome, with a number of imprinted genes being adjacent to each other. Analysis of allele-specific methylation patterns of imprinted loci in the hybrid endosperm identified 21 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of several hundred base pairs in length, corresponding to both imprinted genes and noncoding transcripts. All DMRs identified are uniformly hypomethylated in maternal alleles and hypermethylated in paternal alleles, regardless of the imprinting direction of their corresponding loci.

In the male, but not the female rats of the BC generation, transmission from an affected F 1 mother resulted in significantly higher kidney weight, worse histology and poorer renal function than when the gene was inherited through an affected father. Since at the same time body and kidney weight were higher in the respective unaffected males, the previous effect in the affected rats might be due to a growth factor transferred by the mother's milk.
