40|$|SummaryMigrating cells extend {{protrusions}} {{to establish}} new adhesion sites at their leading edges. One {{of the driving}} forces for cell migration is the <b>directional</b> <b>trafficking</b> of cell-adhesion molecules such as integrins. Here, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb {{is an important component}} of the machinery for <b>directional</b> integrin <b>trafficking</b> in migrating cells. Numb binds to integrin-βs and localizes to clathrin-coated structures (CCSs) at the substratum-facing surface of the leading edge. Numb inhibition by RNAi impairs both integrin endocytosis and cell migration toward integrin substrates. Numb is regulated by phosphorylation since the protein is released from CCSs and no longer binds integrins when phosphorylated by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). Because Numb interacts with the aPKC binding partner PAR- 3, we propose a model in which polarized Numb phosphorylation contributes to cell migration by directing integrin endocytosis to the leading edge...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a {{generalized}} linear model approach, i. e. negative binomial regression, to develop a predictive model for motorcycle fatal accidents on Malaysian primary roads. For the modeling process, a huge data inventory has been carried out, integrating the road geometry features, fatal accident records and <b>traffic</b> <b>censuses</b> from 3 selected states for the past 3 -year period. The results show that motorcycle fatalities per kilometer on primary roads are statistically significantly affected by the average daily number of motorcycles {{and the number of}} access points per kilometer. The model established for this study can also be regarded as the first motorcycle safety performance function in Malaysia and probably in Asia. Also noted in this study is the need to establish a proper and systematic road geometry and <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> inventory in order to develop better accident prediction models for Malaysia in the future.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{acquiring}} the current-year traffic data {{is a problem}} for transport planners since such data may not be available for on-going transport studies. A method is proposed in this paper to predict hourly traffic flows up to and into the near future, using historical data collected from the Hong Kong Annual <b>Traffic</b> <b>Census</b> (ATC). Two parametric and two non-parametric models have been employed and evaluated in this study. The results show that the non-parametric models (Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML)) were more promising for predicting hourly traffic flows at the selected ATC station. Further analysis encompassing 87 ATC stations revealed that the NPR is likely to react to unexpected changes more effectively than the GML method, while the GML model performs better under steady traffic flows. Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the common traffic patterns in Hong Kong and the advantages/disadvantages of the various models, the NPR model is recommended for predicting the hourly traffic flows in that region.

30|$|Regarding traffic data, Czech {{national}} <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> covers most of {{the primary}} road network; however, {{it was observed that}} it does not include interchange ramps on motorways. Since this data is required for developing interchange models, manual traffic counts needed to be performed on all ramps of approx. 450 interchanges (in more than 1000 profiles). Each profile was observed for 2 [*]h of a working day and the results were factored up to AADT, using national guidelines [16].|$|R

30|$|Also on {{national}} roads, national <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> data was found incomplete. AADT was missing on {{large number of}} minor roads, which intersect national roads – therefore {{it would not be}} possible to develop intersection models. Due to immense number of these intersections, it was not feasible to complement it with own survey. Therefore, simplified approach was taken, similar to the Norwegian practice [47] – i.e., not considering intersections with minor roads as individual units, but in terms of their frequency. Feasibility of this approach was previously tested in Czech conditions and found satisfactory [11].|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is on the fundamental capacity bounds of wireless ad hoc networks. We establish {{upper and lower bounds}} on the capacity to shed light on what is theoretically possible and what is currently achievable. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, we introduce and describe a method to find an upper bound on the capacity of wireless networks with arbitrary topology, size and traffic demands. The upper bound not only provides a yardstick against which the throughput of an existing wireless ad hoc network scheme can be gauged, it also provides insight into how to design better routing and medium access control protocols for wireless networks. Using the upper bound, we examine the behavior of networks of different size, under different channel conditions, and with different traffic patterns. Numeric results indicate that, when the channel conditions are known precisely, shadow and multipath fading increase capacity; and that the capacity increases with network size when full traffic patterns are considered but decreases when <b>directional</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns are considered. In the second part, we obtain the performance of an optimistic protocol based on CSMA/CA and compare it against the upper bound. There is a significant gap between the two results, especially when considering large networks operating in the high SNR region. In the third part, we describe a new time-division scheduling scheme derived from the upper bound. In addition, we make an improvement to the schedules that increases the capacity significantly, even for small to medium size networks. Our schedules perform better than the protocol based on CSMA/CA, for medium to high SNR regions. Moreover, they also perform well against the upper bound when there is a <b>directional</b> <b>traffic</b> pattern, but not as well when there is a full traffic pattern. Finally, we examine the effects of time-varying fading and mobility on the schedules. We conclude that our schedules perform well in an environment where the channel changes slowly relative to the schedule update rat...|$|R
40|$|For {{satisfactory}} {{traffic management}} of an intelligent transport system, {{it is vital}} that traffic microwave radar detectors (TMRDs) can provide real-time traffic information with high accuracy. In this study, we develop several information-aided smart schemes for traffic detection improvements of TMRDs in multiple-lane environments. Specifically, we select appropriate thresholds not only for removing noise from fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of regional lane contexts but also for reducing FFT side lobes within each lane. The resulting FFTs of reflected vehicle signals and those of clutter are distinguishable. We exploit FFT and lane-/or time stamp-related information for developing smart schemes, which mitigate adverse effects of lane-crossing FFT side lobes of a vehicle signal. As such, the proposed schemes can enhance the detection accuracy of both lane vehicle flow and <b>directional</b> <b>traffic</b> volume. On-site experimental results demonstrate the advantages and feasibility of the proposed methods, and suggest the best smart scheme...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{show that}} the Na/K-ATPase interacts with caveolin- 1 (Cav 1) and regulates Cav 1 trafficking. Graded {{knockdown}} of Na/K-ATPase decreases the plasma membrane pool of Cav 1, which results in {{a significant reduction in}} the number of caveolae on the cell surface. These effects are independent of the pumping function of Na/K-ATPase, and instead depend on interaction between Na/K-ATPase and Cav 1 mediated by an N-terminal caveolin-binding motif within the ATPase α 1 subunit. Moreover, knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase increases basal levels of active Src and stimulates endocytosis of Cav 1 from the plasma membrane. Microtubule-dependent long-range <b>directional</b> <b>trafficking</b> in Na/K-ATPase–depleted cells results in perinuclear accumulation of Cav 1 -positive vesicles. Finally, Na/K-ATPase knockdown has no effect on processing or exit of Cav 1 from the Golgi. Thus, the Na/K-ATPase regulates Cav 1 endocytic trafficking and stabilizes the Cav 1 plasma membrane pool...|$|R
