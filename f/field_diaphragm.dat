Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source.

These jets of air are usually created {{by the use of}} compressed air, or an electromechanically driven vibrating platform. All of these approaches produce desired results in airflow-control such as enhanced lift and increased maneuverability. Despite the results however, system weight, size, response time and force limit their use in aircraft applications where space is a premium. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the relevant properties for the design of a synthetic jet utilizing three types of piezoelectric actuators as mechanical diaphragms.

40|$|A {{series of}} active {{piezoelectric}} diaphragms were fabricated and patterned with several geometrically defined Inter-Circulating Electrodes "ICE" and Interdigitated Ring Electrodes "ICE". When a voltage potential {{is applied to}} the electrodes, the result is a radially distributed electric field that mechanically strains the piezoceramic along the Z-axis (perpendicular to the applied electric field). Unlike other piezoelectric bender actuators, these Radial <b>Field</b> <b>Diaphragms</b> (RFDs) strain concentrically yet afford high displacements (several times that of the equivalent Unimorph) while maintaining a constant circumference. One of the more intriguing aspects is that the radial strain field reverses itself along the radius of the RFD while the tangential strain remains relatively constant. The result is a Z-deflection that has a conical profile. This paper covers the fabrication and characterization of the 5 cm.

40|$|To perform daytime {{measurements}} of the density and temperature by Rayleigh lidar, {{it is necessary to}} select the wavelength with a very narrow spectral system. This filter is composed by an interference filter and a Fabry Perot etalon. The Fabry Perot etalon is the more performent compound, and it is necessary to build a specific optic around it. The image of the entrance pupil or the <b>field</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is at the infinite and the other diaphragm is on the etalon. The optical quality of the optical system is linked to the spectral resolution of the system to optimize the reduction of the field of view.

40|$|The {{performance}} of systems involving {{a body in}} a fluid flow can be enhanced by manipulation of the body shape through flow control. Active flow control, {{the focus of this}} work, is achieved by energizing low-momentum regions at the wall by tangential blowing using air. One mechanism for blowing air into this region is through synthetic jets. They are devices that push air out from a fixed orifice or a slit {{in the form of a}} jet. The jets are usually created using compressed air or an electromechanically driven vibrating platform. To diminish complexity, reduce weight, and increase time response, piezoelectric actuators used as oscillating diaphragms are often used.

40|$|NASA has {{recently}} {{developed a new}} piezoelectric actuator, the Radial <b>Field</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> or RFD. This actuator uses a radially-directed electric field to generate concentric out-of-plane (Z-axis) motion that allows this packaged device {{to be used as}} a pump or valve diaphragm. In order to efficiently use this new active device, experimental determination of pressure, flow rate, mechanical work, power consumption and overall efficiency needs to be determined by actually building a pump. However, without an optimized pump design, it is difficult to assess the quality of the data, as these results are inherent to the actual pump. Hence, separate experiments must be conducted in order to generate independent results to help guide the design criteria and pump quality. This paper focuses on the experiments used to generate the RFD’s operational parameters and then compares these results to the experimentally determined results of several types of ball pumps. Also discussed are how errors are inherently introduced into the experiments, the pump design, experimental hardware and their effects on the overall system efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) {{and other}} FP fusions have been extensively utilized to track protein dynamics in living cells. Recently, development of photoactivatable, photoswitchable and photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PAFPs) {{has made it}} possible to investigate the fate of discrete subpopulations of tagged proteins. Initial limitations to their use (due to their tetrameric nature) were overcome when monomeric variants, such as Dendra, mEos, and mKikGR were cloned/engineered. Results Here, we report that by closing the <b>field</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> selective, precise and irreversible green-to-red photoconversion (330 - 380 nm illumination) of discrete subcellular protein pools was achieved on a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with standard DAPI, Fluorescein, and Rhodamine filter sets and mercury arc illumination within 5 - 10 seconds. Use of a DAPI-filter cube with long-pass emission filter (LP 420) allowed the observation and control of the photoconversion process in real time. Following photoconversion, living cells were imaged for up to 5 hours often without detectable phototoxicity or photobleaching. Conclusions We demonstrate the practicability of this technique using Dendra 2 and mEos 2 as monomeric, photoconvertible PAFP representatives fused to proteins with low (histone H 2 B), medium (gap junction channel protein connexin 43), and high (α-tubulin; clathrin light chain) dynamic cellular mobility as examples. Comparable efficient, irreversible green-to-red photoconversion of selected portions of cell nuclei, gap junctions, microtubules and clathrin-coated vesicles was achieved. Tracking over time allowed elucidation of the dynamic live-cycle of these subcellular structures. The advantage of this technique is that it can be performed on a standard, relatively inexpensive wide-field fluorescence microscope with mercury arc illumination. Together with previously described laser scanning confocal microscope-based photoconversion methods, this technique promises to further increase the general usability of photoconvertible PAFPs to track the dynamic movement of cells and proteins over time. </p...|$|E

For baseline case, POD results clearly distinguish the primary mode containing most of flow energy from the rest of flow modes (2 - 9 mode) depicting small scale modes.

It contributes to various processes such as expectoration, vomiting, swallowing, urination, and defecation. It facilitates the venous and lymphatic return and helps viscera located above and below the diaphragm to work properly. Its activity is fundamental in the maintenance of posture and body position changes. It can affect the pain perception and emotional state. Many authors reported on diaphragmatic training by using special instruments, whereas only a few studies focused on manual therapy approaches. To the knowledge of the authors, the existing scientific literature does not exhaustively examines the manual evaluation of the diaphragm in its different portions. A complete evaluation of the diaphragm is mandatory for several professional subjects, such as physiotherapists, osteopaths, and chiropractors not only to elaborate a treatment strategy but also to obtain information on the validity of the training performed on the patient.

Wortmannin inhibited contractures evoked by high K+, ryanodine and caffeine, but potentiated the contracture induced by rapamycin, which binds to myoplasmic FK 506 binding protein, an immunophilin {{closely associated with}} the ryanodine receptor.

Previously, it was accepted in the piezoelectric-transducer art {{that in order to}} produce the out-of-plane bending displacement of a diaphragm needed for pumping, one must make the electric field asymmetrical through the thickness, typically by means of electrodes placed on only one side of the piezoelectric material. In the present invention, electrodes are placed on both sides and patterned so as to produce substantial radial as well as through-the-thickness components. Moreover, unlike in the prior art, the electric field can be symmetrical through the thickness.

The invention admits of numerous variations characterized by various degrees of complexity. Figure 1 is a simplified depiction of a basic version. As in other piezoelectric diaphragm pumps of similar basic design, the prime mover is a piezoelectric diaphragm. Application of a suitable voltage to the electrodes on the diaphragm causes it to undergo out-of-plane bending. The bending displacement pushes a fluid out of, or pulls the fluid into, a chamber bounded partly by the diaphragm.

40|$|The {{sky light}} {{background}} in lidar signals is usually supressed {{by a small}} receiver field of view (RFOV) and small bandwidth (BW) interference filters (IFF). • The IFF allow only limited incident angles smaller than Amax. The smaller the filter bandwidth, the smaller is Amax; e. g. for BW = 0. 5 nm Amax = 2. 9 ° (see appendix). • The maximum incident angles in the telescope (RFOV) and at the IFF (Amax) increase with decreasing lidar range (DFO) according to (1) and (2). • For boundary layer measurements a short distance of full overlap (DFO) between the transmitter and the laser fields of view is required (see fig. 2). large Amax, large IFF-BW, low BG supression. • Common circular <b>field</b> of view <b>diaphragms</b> (FOVD) are centred to the telescopes optical axis. Most of their aperture is unnecessary for the lidar signal (see fig. 3, CD, blue area). This results in a high signal BG and a reduced S/N-ratio. How can we minimize the signal background BG with a given Amax and a desired DFO? 1. Tilt the laser according to (4), fig. 2 reduces Amax, IFF-BW, and RFOV. Figure 5. Amax is cut in about half with an optimum laser tilt for the same DFO. The two angles are Amax for the two IFF with 0. 5 nm and 0. 15 nm BW (see full text). Further reduce BG stepwise by (fig. 5, 6) : 2. Use a slit (S) instead of cicular FOVD (CD) removes unnecessary FOVD area. 3. Move slit between far- and nearfield focus (SS) reduces necessary FOVD area...|$|R
