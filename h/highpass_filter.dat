One very simple method to accomplish this is to weight the amount of <b>highpass</b> <b>filtering</b> proportional to the local mean.

50|$|A distortionmeter is {{actually}} a levelmeter with two switchable parallel circuits at the input. The first circuit measures the total signal at the output of a system. (For low distortion levels this will be almost equal to fundamental). That value is adjusted to read 100% or, equivalently, to 0 dB. The second circuit is a filter which removes (as much as practical) the fundamental frequency. This can be a notch filter, one which passes all but the fundamental, with negligible attenuation at other frequencies (including whatever harmonics might be present). Alternatively, if the distortion products are at higher frequencies, a <b>highpass</b> <b>filter</b> can be used if its cutoff rate is sufficiently steep to not affect the expected distortion products.

One aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze further the information which leads them to respond, by measuring their responses to parametrically filtered stimuli.

It was found that many of the neurons could respond to blurred images of faces, with a mean frequency at half-maximum amplitude of the neuronal response to the series of lowpass filtered images of faces of 3. 3 cycles/face. Almost all the neurons had lowpass cutoff frequencies defined in this way below 8 cycles/face. Many of the neurons could also respond to images of faces in which the only information remaining was a limited amount of high spatial frequency edge info~ation. The mean frequency at half-maximum amplitude of the neuronal response to the series of <b>highpass</b> <b>filtered</b> images of faces was 29. 7 cycIes/face.

5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} somewhat {{similar to those}} found in the Roland JX-3P or Teisco SX-240, in that there are two oscillators (referred to as [...] "OSC"s) per voice, with the option of sawtooth and/or square waveforms. These oscillators are controlled digitally with analog circuitry used only to create the sawtooth waveshape. OSC2 can be synchronized to OSC1, or the two oscillators can be cross-modulated. The OSCs can be separated by semitone intervals (up to four octaves) and detuned (to approximately a semitone). There is pulse-width modulation of the square wave of OSC1 (with a dedicated low-frequency oscillator (LFO) for this) and a square-wave sub-oscillator that is fixed at one octave lower. OSC2's pitch can be modulated by one of the two ADSR envelope generators, which are dedicated to VCA volume and VCF cutoff frequency. The filter is a 24dB/octave (four-pole) resonant lowpass type, and there is also a separate 12 dB/octave <b>highpass</b> <b>filter</b> that is not envelope controlled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{infrared}} astronomy, an observed {{image from}} a chop and nod {{process can be}} considered as the result of passing the original image through a <b>highpass</b> <b>filter.</b> Here we propose a restoration algorithm which builds up a tight framelet system that has the <b>highpass</b> <b>filter</b> as one of the framelet filters. Our approach reduces the solution of restoration problem to that of recovering the missing coefficients of the original image in the tight framelet decomposition. The framelet approach provides a natural setting to apply various sophisticated framelet denoising schemes to remove the noise without reducing the intensity of major stars in the image. A proof of the convergence of the algorithm based on convex analysis is also provided.
