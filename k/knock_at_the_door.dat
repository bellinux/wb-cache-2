25|$|Marcello, Schaunard and Colline go out, but Rodolfo remains {{alone for}} a moment in order to finish an article he is writing, {{promising}} to join his friends soon. There is a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: {{when he opened the}} door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon {{back and forth in the}} doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E

Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> surprising since the house is so remote and far from any civilization.

500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E

500|$|Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, {{in which}} she sings [...] "Blue Velvet," [...] and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her {{apartment}} to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knife-point and begins to fellate him before their encounter is interrupted by a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth, inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities—which include inhaling an unidentified gas, dry humping, and sadomasochism—upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent man whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as [...] "Mommy" [...] and to himself as both the [...] "Daddy" [...] and the [...] "Baby," [...] who [...] "wants to fuck." [...] Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to [...] "Do it for van Gogh." [...] When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), there is a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when {{she goes to the}} door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, I Told You Not To Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E
