40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967, long before I ever dreamed that I would {{eventually}} become a wood craftsman, I viewed a collection of small ancient (see missing word in text.) glass perfume vials and bottles which struck me as being very beautiful and sensitive. Their shapes were simple, and the glass had a light blue, iridescent hue {{to the effect of}} being buried for centuries. Eventually, the inspiration from these pieces came to affect my basic theory of wood design, although I did not come to realize the fact until about four years after I started working with wood. I have now developed a very strong liking for the simple curved line. Best of my designs reflect this very strongly, and it has worked exceptionally well for me. I feel that smooth linear shape remains consistently pleasing to <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anybody???s</b> eye because it creates and projects a feeling of rhythm and it is easily understood. So why not incorporate this idea into wood design? It occurred to me after this thought that {{there is no reason why}} wood could not be treated as delicately as glass or crystal and still be a functional piece. The first result of this is a vase pictured on page 6. The form is simple and classical and the piece is functional. (See more in text. ...|$|R

5000|$|The PTS {{witnessed}} a drastic increase (500%) {{in the number}} of residents between its initiation in 1923 and 1959, at which time the school housed around 1,400 children. As oversight of the school became obscured, the PTS sought to expand its employee base. However, because most psychologists dreaded working in a mental institution, the PTS's efforts to recruit qualified staff faced numerous shortcomings. It did not help that the school was situated in Red Deer, a prairie town of around 30, 000, where the number of skilled applicants was minuscule. In these times of desperation, Le Vann once hired someone with no professional experience to fill the position of head psychologist. This person was responsible for the IQ tests that were part of the assessment protocol for admission to the school. The resulting, arbitrary procedure caused numerous able-minded children to be admitted to the school. [...] An ex-employee of the PTS revealed, [...] "Your qualification was grade twelve and they hired <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anybody,</b> as long as they didn't have a criminal record". Le Vann {{even went so far as}} to endorse admitting high-functioning children in order to exploit their abilities as forced labour.|$|E

Jeffrey Gantz, writing in the Boston Phoenix, commented {{on some of the}} discrepancies between the film and history, concluding: [...] "Mahler on the Couch doesn't plumb any psychological depths.

40|$|It is {{impossible}} to ignore {{the degree to which}} notions of race have impacted upon the Australian social and political arena in recent years. Ask <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> about the current 'race debate' and the chances are you will find an opinion firmly located on one side or another of a contentious and emotional divide. The implications of race clearly extend beyond the boundaries of political controversy, and profoundly affect the way people construct their collective and individual subjectivity, that is their identity. However, race is more than merely an avenue though which meaning is derived from the world. Race structures the relations of institutions such as education, and constitutes individuals as acting—or acted upon—subjects. Race therefore signifies power, for it helps define meanings and social values. Through education, for instance, race has historically been {{at the heart of a}} cultural process of enlisting children into a particular doctrine which defines as positive or negative the child’s relation to the dominant Australian culture. This experience is not unique to Australia, nor for that matter to education. The manipulation of the meaning of race has an extensive history which has enabled particular groups to realise certain possibilities while denying them to others...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years a new actor is born within the supply-chain linking creativity, {{production}} and consumption. We {{are talking about}} those, public or private, national or trans-national, Agencies which mission is to discover new designers {{in order to promote}} and drive them into the market. At the peak of 20 th century production positivism, design, like all so-called creative activities, fit easily in the well-oiled system of profits and consumption (at least until the economic and cultural crisis of the Seventies). However, professional placement today has become much more difficult because of our fluid social and production contexts, which force us to constantly redefine our knowledge and skills. At the same time, the explosion in the number of schools seems to have turned creativity into a sort of placebo-like magic potion that <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> can throw together. As a result, the number of newborn professionals has also exploded, and companies (the targets of all this creativity) see their arrival as a sort of attack of ‘foreign bodies’. And therefore they raise a higher and higher protective wall of fiduciary knowledge. Over the past 15 years, an interesting and representative phenomenon has grown up out of this unique condition. Indeed, a new link has been added to this ‘evolutionary chain’: promotional agencies for young designers. Whether national (and therefore subsidised by public funds) or true private and supranational service providers, there are now dozens of these agencies worldwide. These structures aren’t totally new, since their roots can be found in one of the key experiences of the very birth of industrial design: the Deutscher Werkbund founded in 1907. At the time, the organisation’s goal was to restore a virtuous link between creativity and production, a link that had been shattered by the first wave of industrialisation due to the impossibility of reconciling artisanal creative dynamics with industrial processes. Today, the goal of this type of organisation is to re-establish communication (which has broken down by information overload) between designers and companies, or more precisely, between supply and demand...|$|E
40|$|Organizations work {{to socialize}} members, while members strive to adapt. There is {{necessarily}} a blending that occurs so that an individual, with personal goals and ambitions, can be enfolded in the organization, while simultaneously the organization achieves its goals. ^ Informal communication {{is an important}} and all-encompassing way to achieve both socialization and adaptation. A large portion of informal communication is composed of humorous interaction, hence many researchers point to its significance as a research area. ^ This study focused on identifying subgroups who were united by a shared perspective {{on the use of}} humor in their organization. Fifteen organizational members from the Heartland Chapter of the American Red Cross, Omaha, Nebraska were interviewed about their perspectives on humor at the Red Cross. Interviews were transcribed and through extensive analysis of the interview data, a 60 statement Q-deck was constructed. Thirty-three organizational members sorted the Q-deck. ^ Analysis of the rotated Q-factors revealed three distinct subgroups. These were labeled, the 2 ̆ 2 traditionalists, 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 2 balancers, 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 enthusiasts. 2 ̆ 2 The 2 ̆ 2 traditionalists 2 ̆ 2 strictly limit their use of humor. They believe in the conservative, traditional image of the Red Cross and do not want to use humor in any way that diminishes their idealistic image of the organization or their own professional status. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 balancers 2 ̆ 2 support the use of humor in the organization when they deem it appropriate. They are open to various functions for humor, and various topics as well. They balanced their responses to all six categories of statements. They also balanced the usefulness of using humor against its impact in the relationship. They value witty, topical, intellectual humor. ^ The 2 ̆ 2 enthusiasts 2 ̆ 2 are extremely enthusiastic about the use of humor in the organization. They wholeheartedly embrace its use with <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> at anytime. They are not connected to organizational relationships as closely as the 2 ̆ 2 balancers 2 ̆ 2 and prefer to use formula jokes rather than spontaneous humor. ...|$|E
