5000|$|His ongoing stamina {{has given}} rise to a {{consistent}} international tour schedule for Norman Doray, including a support slot for Swedish House Mafia and David Guetta on his UK tour, landmark appearances at Creamfields, Tomorrowland and ULTRA Music Festival and a residential streak in Las Vegas for both XS and Light. [...] Come 2016, Norman’s balance of high-profile label duties, relevant club etiquette and a respectful guise over the French sound was never more relevant to the changing tides of electronic music. Frontline single ‘All In’ balanced these merits in a truly special way, garnering huge US radio support on Sirius XM and Music Choice whilst also gaining strong tastemaker attention. 2017 promises a re-focus on the house roots that first gave international rise to Doray. Pairing exciting new material alongside a fresh branded live concept, the road ahead looks no less enticing for an artist whose timeless vision for modern house music continues to <b>hold</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> every corner of the globe.|$|E

Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, <b>holding</b> the <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of Cain and Abel: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod.|$|R
50|$|Week 7 - Eliminated Contestants - For the {{opportunity}} {{to return to the}} competition, three weigh-in passes were up for grabs. With the Black team winning the first pass at the weigh-in for making the most progress since Day 1, the second one was offered to the winner of the Contest. The first round had one member of each team (Cher, Kevin, Sam and Janet) <b>hold</b> a <b>weight</b> with both hands above a yellow tape, arms outstretched. The first to drop their arms and break the yellow tape was out of the Contest, and this was Cher. The second round had the remaining teams choose a representative (Kevin, Jess and Kirsten) to <b>hold</b> a <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> their shoulders with 5 kilograms being added every minute. The first to drop the weight would not go into the final round, and this was Kirsten. The final round had Sam and Rosemary (Red and Blue team) go head to head in an old classic spin bike game to see who could reach 5 km first. Sam won this for the red team, giving him and Jess a weigh-in pass for the week.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{decisions on}} emissions {{of a stock}} pollutant under uncertainty in a two period model. Decisions {{are based on a}} weighted average of expected utility (EU) and the MaxiMin criterion. I first show that more <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the worst case (less <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> EU) may lead to increased first period emissions. The effect of learning possibilities on emissions is not clear in general, but depends qualitatively <b>on</b> the <b>weight</b> given to MaxiMin: For the quadratic utility case, considering prospective learning increases today?s abatement effort, i. e. the ?irreversibility effect? <b>holds,</b> if the <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> EU is small. This contrasts standard results on the irreversibility effect for EU which translates to small <b>weights</b> <b>on</b> MaxiMin. There is, however, the possibility of a negative value of learning. It is shown that the irreversibility effect holds if and only if the value of learning is negative. Consequences for the applicability of generalized EU-MaxiMin are discussed.

5000|$|Me, Myself & I {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics who {{found it to}} be of less quality compared to All or Nothing. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised the album for toning down on featured artists to focus more on Joe's deep street lyricism backed by ear-grabbing production, concluding that [...] "hearing this high-profile thug so boldly reclaiming his street cred without any concessions is exciting and makes it easy to shrug off this driven full-length's one-track mind." [...] Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times praised the album for balancing out the street bangers with contemplative tracks like [...] "Bendicion Mami" [...] and [...] "Story to Tell", saying that it makes [...] "Joe's latest a well-rounded affair." [...] Andrew Kameka of HipHopDX found some of the lyrical content wearing thin but praised Joe for sticking with his gut of performing gruff street tracks with aggressive production, saying that [...] "Fat Joe doesn't <b>hold</b> his <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> a few of the album's songs, but he delivers enough strength to silence anyone who questions his place in Hip Hop.|$|R

5000|$|The {{function}} of the cam systems (known as the 'eccentrics') is to maximize the energy storage throughout the draw cycle and provide let-off {{at the end of}} the cycle (less <b>holding</b> <b>weight</b> at full draw). A traditional recurve bow has a very linear draw weight curve - meaning that as the bow is drawn back, the draw force becomes heavier with each inch of draw (and most difficult at full draw). Therefore, little energy is stored in the first half of the draw, and much more energy at the end where the draw weight is heaviest. The compound bow operates with a different weight profile, reaching its peak weight within the first few inches of the draw, and remaining more flat and constant until the end of the cycle where the cams [...] "let-off" [...] and allow a reduced <b>holding</b> <b>weight.</b> This manipulation of the peak weight throughout the draw (accomplished by the elliptical shape of the cams that change leverage and mechanical advantage) is why compound bows store more energy and shoot faster than an equivalent peak weight recurve bow or longbow.|$|R
