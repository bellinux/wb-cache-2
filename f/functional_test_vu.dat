40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} work-related {{limitations}} assessed using self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODS: Work-related limitations of 92 patients were assessed using self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing.</b> To obtain the assessed limitations the patient (self-report), the physician (clinical examination) and a trained evaluator (<b>functional</b> <b>testing)</b> completed a scorings form about the work-related limitations of the patient. The Isernhagen Work Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) was used to obtain the <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> results. A kappa value of more than 0. 60, absolute agreement of more than 80 % and ICC of more than 0. 75 were considered as acceptable. RESULTS: Little agreement and correlation among self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> were found {{for the assessment of}} work-related limitations. Self-reported limitations were considerably higher than from those derived from clinical examination or <b>functional</b> <b>testing.</b> Additionally, the limitations derived from the clinical examination were higher than those derived from the IWS FCE. CONCLUSION: Comparing self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> for assessing work-related limitations in CLBP patients showed large considerable differences in limitations.

40|$|Background: Both {{isokinetic}} <b>testing</b> and <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> {{are commonly}} used to evaluate anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) patients. The object {{of this study was}} to evaluate motor performance of the knee and determine the relationship of isokinetic test scores to scores on a variety of lower extremity <b>functional</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods: Ten healthy subjects and eleven ACLR patients at least six months after surgery performed the following: knee isokinetic tests at 60 and 180 deg/sec; three <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> including leg vertical jump, single hop, and triple cross-over hop for distance. The International Knee Document Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDCSKEF) was used to score the self-assessment of each study participant. Paired T-test was used to compare the involved and uninvolved knee. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between the scores on the isokinetic <b>test</b> and <b>functional</b> <b>tests.</b> Significance was determined by P< 0. 05. Results: IKDCSKEF score was significantly lower in patients than control subjects. Quadriceps peak torque and <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> scores were significantly lower in the involved knee of the ACLR subjects compared to the uninvolved knee. Correlation coefficients of isokinetic peak torque to body weight and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> were not significant in patients or control subjects, whi 1 e the limb symmetry index (LSI) of the quadriceps isokinetics peak torque to body weight and the LSI of the <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> were significant (r = 0. 54 to 0. 97). Conclusion: These results indicate a significant relationship between the LSI of various <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> and the LSI of isokinetic testing among ACLR patients. Thus, in situations where an isokinetic dynamometer is not available, the LSI of <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> can be used to estimate quadriceps deficiency for ACLR patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Functional test {{sequences}} {{are often}} used in manufacturing testing to target defects that are not detected by structural test. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the quality of <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> sequences. However, it is very time-consuming to evaluate the quality of <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> sequences by gate-level fault simulation. Therefore, we propose output deviations as a metric to grade <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> sequences at the register transfer (RT) level without explicit fault simulation. Experimental results for the open-source Parwan processor and the Scheduler module of the Illinois Verilog Model (IVM) show that the deviations metric is computationally efficient and it correlates well with gate-level coverage for stuck-at, transition-delay, and bridging faults. Results also show that <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> sequences that are reordered based on output deviations provide steeper gate-level fault coverage ramp-up compared to other ordering methods.
