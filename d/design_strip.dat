40|$|Collapsible {{soils are}} {{encountered}} in arid and semi-arid regions. Such soils cause potential construction problems {{due to their}} collapse upon wetting. The collapse phenomenon is primarily related to the open structure of the soil. Several soil collapse classifications based on parameters such as moisture content, dry density, Atterberg limits and clay content have been proposed in the literature as indicators of the soil collapse potential. Direct measurement {{of the magnitude of}} collapse, using laboratory and/or field tests, is essential once a soil showed indications of collapse potential. Treatment methods such as soil replacement, compaction control and chemical stabilization showed significant reduction in the settlement of collapsible soils. The design of foundations on collapsible soils depends on the depth of the soil, magnitude of collapse and economics of the <b>design.</b> <b>Strip</b> foundations are commonly used when collapsing soil extends to a shallow depth while piles and drilled piers are recommended in cases where the soil extends to several meters. This paper provides a comprehensive review of collapsible soils. These include the different types of collapsible soils, mechanisms of collapse, identification and classification methods, laboratory and field testing, treatment methods and guidelines for foundation design...|$|E

When the puddled soil are dried the structure of soil becomes massive. Hard consistency caused the roots of crop do not able to penetrate the soil. To overcome those problems, the research of the addition 2 ̆ 7 of organic matter into the soil under various method of irrigation was conducted.

The results of this experiment indicated that the bulk density increased with time from the plowing up to the harvest. However, the hydraulic conductivity of soil decreased. The lowest bulk density was in the plots buried by straw (0. 85 gr/cm 3) and the highest was buried by the leaf of gliriside (Glericidia sepium) (0. 96 gr/c). The addition of organic matter into the soil increased nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.

40|$|Previous {{seismic testing}} of {{reinforced}} earth walls, and present design methods, are outlined. Six one metre tall model reinforced earth walls were tested under normal gravity on a shaking table. Accelerations, displacements and reinforcing strip forces were measured. A series of simple sinusoidal single-pulse wave forms, and the El Centro 1940 north-south recorded earthquake motion {{were used as}} input to the shaking table. Permanent outward displacement of a block consisting of the facing, part of the reinforced block, and a wedge of retained soil behind the reinforced block occurred when a limiting or yield acceleration was exceeded. The wall facing remained essentially vertical. The critical (minimum) yield acceleration was found to occur when and after the failure surface outcropped at the fill surface. This critical yield acceleration was calculable using a limiting equilibrium formulation, within the variability of the observed results. A sensitivity analysis of the formulation is presented. The apparent soil friction angle is found to reduce during repeated seismic shaking, while the apparent soil-strip friction coefficient is found to increase probably to a limiting value. In design, the peak value of the friction coefficient found from direct shear tests between the soil and reinforcing can be used. To calculate <b>design</b> <b>strip</b> forces, an upper bound seismic earth pressure coefficient based on the Mononobe-Okabe dynamic earth pressure coefficient KAE is proposed. Measured displacements are plotted on charts for three sliding block displacement prediction methods. One approach, using random vibration and probability theory, is more rational and complete than the others, and provides {{an estimate of the}} prohability of exceedence of the calculated displacement. The method is quite complicated, however, and for everyday design a simple upper bound on a chart derived from an equivalent pulse technique is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Steel strip {{is usually}} stored as a coil, which will slump {{to some degree}} after {{the removal of the}} mandrel. More often than not, the amount of {{slumping}} is so minor that it is assumed not to have occurred. Occasionally, the amount, though minor, is sufficient to compromise the integrity of the cylindrical bore which compromises subsequent handling of the coil. In extreme situations, the slumping progresses to a complete collapse of the coil. Such a collapse is rare. It occurs when a coil cannot hold up its own mass and loses its circular cross-section. It is thought to be principally associated with the size and weight of the coil, inappropriate coiling tensions and/or poor re-coiler equipment <b>design.</b> <b>Strip</b> properties, especially inter-strip contact characteristics, have been demonstrated experimentally to be crucial determinants of whether or not coil collapse is likely to occur. The particular kind of slumping/collapse of interest to BlueScope Steel, who proposed this Study Group problem, is the minor slumping that compromises cylindrical bore integrity. It is referred to as coil slump. The Study Group was asked to investigate and model the phenomenon of coil slumping, and, if possible, to quantify the effect of critical parameters, especially coil mass, strip thickness and inter-strip friction. In particular, it was suggested that deliberations should aim to characterize the geometry of slumping and to predict the deformation profile at the innermost and outermost wraps. For BlueScope Steel, the long term objectives are: (1) the formulation of the governing equations for the stresses in a coil under self-weight, (2) the identification of analytical solutions and/or numerical schemes for the final coil shape after slumping, and (3) the formulation of exclusion rules-of-thumb which predict when a particular form of slump (oval or triangular) is likely to occur. The Study Group made some progress with (1), limited progress with (2) and most progress with (3). Though various computer programs were written to explore different force and energy balance scenarios, they only scratched the surface with regards to (2). Success with it is heavily dependent in substantial progress being made with (1). As explained in detail in the sequel, the Study Group’s deliberations resulted in an improved understanding of the coil slumping/collapse problem by identifying a number of specific issues that should be of direct assistance to BlueScope Steel’s future management of coil slumping/collapse. In particular, such issues included the need, from a modelling perspective, to draw a clear distinction between minor slumping and major slumping which can subsequently lead to collapse; the formulation of a heuristic hypothesis about the dynamics of coil slumping/collapse which can be compared with historical data and act act as a conceptualization guide for further investigations; the identification of a “tension-weight ratio” (R) as the relevant dimensionless group which represents an indicative rule-of-thumb which can be applied in practice; and proposed, {{on the basis of the}} hypothesis, an efficient procedure for recording collapse events and statistically identifying possible collapse situations...|$|E

It might be useful to develop installation guidelines covering aspects such as: in-ground profile; rumble strip width, length, and depth; and milled versus pressed and conventional versus sinusoidal rumble strips.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the reliability of strip footing {{in the presence of}} spatially variable undrained shear strength that linearly increases with depth. A non-stationary random field is used to model the spatially varying undrained shear strength. A strip footing example is presented {{to investigate}} the effect of spatially variable undrained shear strength on the performance of strip footing. The results indicate that the mean bearing capacity for spatially variable undrained shear strength is smaller than that obtained from a deterministic analysis. Both the mean and standard deviation of bearing capacity increase with increasing autocorrelation length. Ignoring the trend of undrained shear strength linearly increasing with depth will significantly overestimate the probability of failure of the strip footing. A factor of safety significantly below 3. 0 may be used for <b>designing</b> <b>strip</b> footings if the trend of undrained shear strength linearly increasing with depth is considered properly...|$|R
