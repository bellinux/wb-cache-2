The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E

On rare occasions, as when his car fell behind with minor mechanical troubles {{and he felt}} he <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> he would abandon his classic technique and adopt a more aggressive (and riskier) style. This circumstance produced what many observers consider the finest driving performance of his career, when a punctured tire put him nearly two laps down halfway through the 1967 Rex Mays 300 Indycar race at Riverside, California. He produced an inspired effort, made up the deficit and won the race with a dramatic last-lap pass of runner-up Bobby Unser.|$|E

Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E

They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are."

The album was produced by Rick Rubin who had worked with hard rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and System of a Down, as well as idiosyncratic singers such as Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. The band felt they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> by a newer approach, and possibly quite a bit to gain.

Francis began writing in her diary while the two played the last of their songs. After they finished, Francis told them they wrote beautiful ballads but that they were too intellectual for the young generation. Greenfield suggested that they play a song they had written for the Shepherd Sisters. Sedaka protested that Francis would be insulted by being played such a puerile song, but Greenfield reminded him Francis had not accepted their other suggestions and they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> After Sedaka played [...] "Stupid Cupid", Francis told them they had just played her new hit.

2500|$|Four years later, {{thanks to}} an $8000 gift from a friend, Resurrection Band {{recorded}} their first album, Awaiting Your Reply, over a two-week period of marathon all-night sessions. Although the band had completed the album, including the cover art, no Christian record label would risk releasing it, as the Led Zeppelin/Jefferson Airplane inspired music was considered much too controversial for the Christian market at that time. [...] Star Song Records were warned away from the project by other gospel music executives, but the tiny label <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> so they signed the band and released the record as it was.

2500|$|England needed 179 runs to win, not an {{impossible}} task even though John Dewes had been struck with a throat inflection and had been absent from the field.

To be fair they had made 212 for the first wicket against the [...] earlier in the year. On this occasion they added 21 against Lindwall and Miller when the spinners were brought on. Washbrook always found [...] "Wrong Grip Jake" [...] difficult to play and was bowled by his googly.

Simpson and Hutton [...] "opened" [...] the innings again in the morning, Hutton was inclined to fancy England's chances if he stayed in past lunch, and he did, but Simpson was bowled by Lindwall (3/29) for 28. John Dewes, coming in to bat from his sick bed like Eddie Paynter in the Fourth Test of 1932–33, stayed in for 46minutes making a gutsy 5 before falling to Iverson (2/36) at 82/4. In the lunch break England needed {{less than a hundred}} runs to win and there was an earnest discussion as to whether Hutton should bat in his usual careful way or should try to make the runs before he ran out of partners, as had happened at Brisbane. He decided on the latter and by forcing the pace struck out at Bill Johnston (4/26) and was caught at square leg for 40, which caused a deathly silence across the 50,000 strong crowd. As in the first innings Brian Close was soon out (lbw to Johnston for 1), Brown was bowled by Lindwall, who then removed Evans [...] "with a ball which pitched outside the off stump, came in at a crazy angle and knocked back the off stump without leaving the turf by a centimetre". Gilbert Parkhouse, who batted manfully for 102 minutes and when he was out for 28 England were 134/9 and still needed 45 to win. Alec Bedser (14 not out) <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> and struck out with the bat before Doug Wright (2) succumbed to Johnston and England were out for 150.|$|E
