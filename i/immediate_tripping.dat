40|$|The large {{deployment}} of network automation with reclosing practices {{has been the}} usual solution adopted by distributors to achieve the goal of providing a distribution network with high performances in terms of number and duration of interruptions. In particular, the usual practice adopted by distributor when managing faults in distribution circuits consists in clearing the faults by the <b>immediate</b> <b>tripping</b> {{of one or more}} circuit breakers, and re-energize the lines after the automatic reclosing time. In distribution networks the reclosing time of a circuit breaker is typically 300 milliseconds, that is the shortest permissible time in which the circuit breaker need to reclose. Various studies have shown that up to as 90...|$|E

In order to perform erosion quickly with low power consumption, the process is performed in such a way way that the sampling voltage is continuously increased until a sampling discharge occurs and, the <b>immediate</b> <b>tripping</b> of the erosion high-current discharge is started when there is a sufficiently large change in the sampling discharge current in the time unit...|$|E

US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara proposed sending Marine Corps Major General Victor Krulak on an <b>immediate</b> fact-finding <b>trip.</b> The NSC agreed that Joseph Mendenhall—a Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience—would accompany him and the pair began the mission later that day.|$|R
40|$|With the {{motivation}} of determining the critical roughness size, a global stability and sensitivity analysis of a three-dimensional Falkner–Skan–Cooke (FSC) boundary layer with a cylindrical surface roughness is performed. The roughness size is chosen such that breakdown to turbulence is initiated by a global version of traditional secondary instabilities of the crossflow (CF) vortices, instead of an <b>immediate</b> flow <b>tripping</b> at the roughness. The resulting global eigenvalue spectra of the systems {{are found to be}} very sensitive to numerical parameters and domain size. This sensitivity to numerical parameters is quantified using the "-pseudospectrum, and the dependency on the domain is analysed through an impulse response and an energy budget. It is shown that the growth rates increase with domain size, which originates from the inclusion of stronger CF vortices in the baseflow. This is reflected in a change in the rate of advective energy transport by the baseflow. It is concluded that the onset of global instability in a FSC boundary layer as the roughness height is increased does not correspond to an <b>immediate</b> flow <b>tripping</b> behind the roughness, but occurs for lower roughness heights if su ciently long domains are considered. However, the great sensitivity results in an inability to accurately pinpoint the exact parameter values for the bifurcation, and the large spatial growth of the disturbances in the long domains eventually becomes larger than what can be resolved using finite precision arithmetics.   QC 20161125 </p...|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{immediate}} and pragmatic reasons to consider one-way human space exploration missions are explored by Krauss. Since {{much of the}} cost of a voyage to Mars will be spent on returning to Earth, if the fuel for the return is carried on board, this greatly increases the mission mass requirement - that in turn requires even more fuel. [...] "Human space travel is so expensive and so dangerous" [...] according to Krauss, [...] "we are going to need novel, even extreme solutions if we really want to expand the range of human civilization beyond our own planet." [...] Delivering food and supplies to pioneers via unmanned spacecraft is less expensive than designing an <b>immediate</b> return <b>trip.</b>|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system suffers from a chronic malady [...] the {{revolving}} door syndrome at its hospitals. It is so bad {{that the federal government}} says one in five elderly patients is back in the hospital within 30 days of leaving. Some return trips are predictable elements of a treatment plan. Others are unplanned but difficult to prevent: patients go home, new and unexpected problems arise, and they require an <b>immediate</b> <b>trip</b> back to the hospital. But many of these readmissions can and should be prevented. They are the result of a fragmented system of care that too often leaves discharged patients to their own devices, unable to follow instructions they didn't understand, and not taking medications or getting the necessary follow-up care. The federal government has pegged the cost of readmissions for Medicare patients alone at $ 26 billion annually, and says more than $ 17 billion of it pays for return trips that need not happen if patients get the right care. This is one reason the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has identified avoidable readmissions as one of the leading problems facing the U. S. {{health care system}} and now penalizes hospitals with high rates of readmissions for their heart failure, heart attack, and pneumonia patients. This report is being released in conjunction with the Robert Wood John Foundation's Care About Your Care initiative, which is devoted to improving care transitions when people leave the hospital. It looks at the issue of readmissions in two ways: by the numbers and {{through the eyes of the}} people who live them...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} looked at the absence and need for orbital public {{transport}} corridors in the Greater Dublin Area [1]. This current paper outlines recent evidence which demonstrates that demand for such orbital services exists. Recent travel survey data indicates that demand exists in Dublin for both orbital and “networked” trips. In surveys of public transport users on two public transport corridors in the Greater Dublin Area, 27 % of people transferred either from or to another public transport service as part of their journey. Overall this appears a very significant level of passenger transfer within an urban transport market where traditionally transferability is thought of as being low or negligible. This suggests that there is an existing demand for orbital and directional trips (those which involve a transfer) within the Greater Dublin Area. Both surveys were taken across contrasting areas of the city. The evidence for transfer demand is corroborated by the census and by household travel data collected by the NTA, both of which indicate a clear and significant demand for orbital trips. No matching or supporting high level of service corridors currently exist to support these. The Dublin City Council Core Strategy also suggests the implementation of an orbital network and this should, in a normal planning framework, lead transport strategy. Orbital High Quality Bus Corridors have been proposed for Dublin in the past but never implemented. Orbital routes are often considered a costly idea that is unpopular with transport users. Yet many cities provide them in a successful, often revenue-generating context. Cities that support successful orbital services take a Network Effect approach to service design where high quality transferability is paramount. Local and international evidence suggests that orbital QBCs can be a success if implemented {{with a high level of}} service. The benefits of implementing orbital high quality corridors goes beyond serving <b>immediate</b> <b>trip</b> demand and can help to create an effective city-wide transport network...|$|R
6000|$|Morgan's pursuit {{comes next}} {{in order of}} review--a pursuit of a far more ambitious nature than mine. It was always part of my second brother's whimsical, self-contradictory {{character}} to view with the profoundest contempt the learned profession by which he gained his livelihood, {{and he is now}} occupying the long leisure hours of his old age in composing a voluminous treatise, intended, one of these days, to eject the whole body corporate of doctors from the position which they have usurped in the estimation of their fellow-creatures. This daring work is entitled [...] "An Examination of the Claims of Medicine on the Gratitude of Mankind. Decided in the Negative by a Retired Physician." [...] So far as I can tell, the book is likely to extend to the dimensions of an Encyclopedia; for it is Morgan's plan to treat his comprehensive subject principally from the historical point of view, and to run down all the doctors of antiquity, one after another, in regular succession, from the first of the tribe. When I last heard of his progress he was hard on the heels of Hippocrates, but had no <b>immediate</b> prospect of <b>tripping</b> up his successor, Is this the sort of occupation (I ask myself) in which a modern young lady is likely to feel the slightest interest? Once again, clearly not.|$|R
40|$|As consumers, {{our lives}} are full of planning. Understanding the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of consumer planning, how planning performance improves with experience, and the possible interventions that may help people form better shopping strategies have important implications for marketers, policy makers, and consumers. Despite the importance of this topic, there is a scarcity of research on consumer planning in marketing. Most research has focused on planned vs. unplanned purchases and defines planned purchases strictly as those items that were fully specified before entering the store (e. g., on a shopping list). These studies have not examined the psychology of planning itself and ignored the fact that an 2 ̆ 2 unplanned 2 ̆ 2 purchase made in the store can be the result of a well developed plan that intentionally stopped short of full specification. ^ In the current research, planning is defined as coming up with a scheme or procedures for the accomplishment of an objective before the commencement of the task. We focus on repeated multi-store price search behavior because it provides an ideal framework to study planning from the perspective of human information-processing. We show in four simulated shopping experiments that consumers often fail to plan optimally and do not appreciate the value of early learning. Fortunately, after obtaining relevant experience consumers are able to increase their awareness to track and keep important information in working memory for the successful plan execution. As a result, they transferred their planning to shopping in a different situation or product category successfully. Finally, having consumers explicitly verbalize their plan has mixed effects on their performance depending on what stage of this repeated shopping process consumers are asked to focus on. On the one hand, explicit planning for <b>immediate</b> shopping <b>trips</b> at a 2 ̆ 2 deep 2 ̆ 2 level helps people perform better by making them focus on strategy-oriented metacognitive processes. On the other hand, having people plan for their final shopping habits was not helpful and inhibits their initial learning. Implications of our results as well as future research directions are discussed at the end. ...|$|R
40|$|Public bikesharing—the {{shared use}} of a bicycle fleet—is an {{innovative}} transportation strategy that has recently emerged in major cities around the world, including North America. Information technology (IT) -based bikesharing systems typically position bicycles throughout an urban environment, among a network of docking stations, for <b>immediate</b> access. <b>Trips</b> can be one-way, round-trip, or both, depending on the operator. Bikesharing {{can serve as a}} first-and-last mile connector to other modes, as well as for both short and long distance destinations. In 2012, 22 IT-based public bikesharing systems were operating in the United States, with a total of 884, 442 users and 7, 549 bicycles. Four IT-based programs in Canada had a total of 197, 419 users and 6, 115 bicycles. Two IT-based programs in Mexico had a total of 71, 611 users and 3, 680 bicycles. (Membership numbers reflect the total number of short- and long-term users.) This study evaluates public bikesharing in North America, reviewing the change in travel behavior exhibited by members of different programs {{in the context of their}} business models and operational environment. This Phase II research builds on data collected during our Phase I research conducted in 2012. During the 2012 research (Phase I), researchers conducted 14 expert interviews with industry experts and public officials in the United States and Canada, as well as 19 interviews with the manager and/or key staff of IT-based bikesharing organizations. For more information on the Phase I research, please see the Shaheen et al., 2012 report Public Bikesharing in North America: Early Operator and User Understanding. For this Phase II study, an additional 23 interviews were conducted with IT-based bikesharing organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in Spring 2013. Notable developments during this period include the ongoing expansion of public bikesharing in North America, including the recent launches of multiple large bikesharing programs in the United States (i. e., Citi Bike in New York City, Divvy in Chicago, and Bay Area Bike Share in the San Francisco Bay Area). In addition to expert interviews, the authors conducted two kinds of surveys with bikesharing users. One was the online member survey. This survey was sent to all people for whom the operator had an email address. The population of this survey was mainly annual members of the bikesharing system, and the members took the survey via a URL link sent to them from the operator. The second survey was an on-street survey. This survey was designed for anyone, including casual users (i. e., those who are not members of the system and use it on a short-term basis), to take “on-street” via a smartphone. The member survey was deployed in five cities: Montreal, Toronto, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Mexico City. The on-street survey was implemented in three cities: Boston, Salt Lake City, and San Antonio...|$|R
