5|$|At the Paris Air Show in June 2011, Hong Kong Airlines had {{announced}} a signed contract for 10 Airbus A380's however due to China's anger with the European Union over plans to force all airlines {{to take part}} in its carbon-trading scheme, the Chinese government has blocked progress on Airbus’s sale of 10 A380s to Hong Kong Airlines. Normally, airlines in Hong Kong are not required to seek approval from the Chinese government to proceed with aircraft orders. The A380 cancellation became an issue as Hong Kong Airlines' parent, Hainan Airlines, is registered in mainland China, not Hong Kong SAR.
