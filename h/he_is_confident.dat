25|$|When {{either of}} the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the {{government}} feels the need for an immediate procedure, the President can promulgate ordinances which have the same force and effect as an act passed by Parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the Parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier. Under , the President as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> that the government commands majority support in the Parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and Parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of Parliament when in force and {{it is the responsibility of}} the President to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and President, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of ordinances after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the President. President should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which is violating the constitution or needs amendment to the constitution. The President should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the Parliament or violating the constitution.|$|E

2500|$|In {{light of}} the poem's {{situation}} within the group of sonnets expressing separation from the youth and the feelings of betrayal seen in Sonnet 35 and 40-42, Landry argues that the speaker in the last line praises the youth's fidelity not because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> of the youth's constancy but because he fitfully hopes that the youth will have a constant heart. Putting it another way, the speaker hopes that by praising the youth for his constancy the youth will become more constant while the pair is separated. This style of cautious advice finds parallels in Renaissance rhetoric. Francis Bacon in his essay, [...] "Of Praise", explains a particular method of addressing kings and great persons with civility in which, [...] "by telling men what they are, they represent to them what they should be". In addition, C.S. Lewis notes that an established feature of praise verse in the Renaissance was that it, [...] "hid advice as flattery and recommended virtues by feigning that they already existed".|$|E
