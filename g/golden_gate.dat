5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind and fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Strait, oceanic wind and fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate,</b> which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, some of {{the stones}} were used to {{construct}} an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> Park.

Some of these {{ended up in the}} park's AIDS Memorial Grove, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.|$|E

5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate,</b> Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E
