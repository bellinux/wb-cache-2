40|$|To {{describe}} {{a simple and}} efficacious surgical technique {{in the treatment of}} TMJ ankylosis, namely gap arthroplasty and to emphasize the role of physical therapy after surgery. Design: Clinical <b>documentation,</b> <b>operation</b> notes and post-operative follow up of TMJ ankylosis cases which were operated by using the gap arthroplasty without interposition of any materials. Setting: Oral and maxillofacial surgery division of the College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subject: Ten cases of TMJ ankylosis operated by using gap arthroplasty and without interposition of any materials. Results: In all cases, gap arthroplasty was used without interposition of any materials. Physical therapy began from the second post-operative day after intraoperative initial manipulation of mandible following joint release. Within 8 weeks of the operation, mandibular range of motion improved remarkably and an average 40 - 50 mm interincisal distance achieved. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications and the mouth-opening has remained, without tendency to relapse, for the past four years. Conclusions: Gap arthroplasty is a simple, yet efficacious surgical procedure for the release of the ankylosis of temporomandibular joint. It assessed the preservation of some remnants of the condylar head and maintained the functional matrix. Nevertheless, it does not by itself bring about a satisfactory result and the importance in post-operative management is the opening exercise of the mandible for at least 6 months after surgery.

However, they cannot support documentation jobs because the jobs need individual creativity which is difficult to share. This paper proposes a ‘Know-how Sharing Agent’ which allows individual creativity used for documentation jobs to be shared. The Know-how Sharing Agent supports document creation by preparing the most exemplary document and its <b>documentation</b> <b>operations.</b> The <b>documentation</b> <b>operations</b> were also saved by the agent automatically when the document was created. This type of agent thus promotes documentation activities by sharing the know-how needed for documentation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} reliant on software {{which must be}} sus-tained into the future. To sustain these systems organizations must define sustain-ment, meet criteria to enter sustainment, and overcome some classic sustainment challenges. This article discusses these tasks along with historical parallel develop-ment and sustainment and potential future trends in software sustainment. Software Sustainment Now and Future While DoD Instruction 5000. 02 describes sustainment in de-tail, no authoritative definition of “software sustainment ” exists. The SEI’s working definition is as follows: The processes, procedures, people, material, and information required to support, maintain, and operate the software aspects of a system. Given this definition, software sustainment addresses other issues not always {{an integral part of}} maintenance such as <b>documentation,</b> <b>operations,</b> deployment, security, configuration management, training (users and sustainment personnel), help desk, commercial off-the shelf (COTS) product and license man-agement, and technology refresh. Successful software sustain-ment consists of more than modifying and updating source code. It also depends on the experience of the sustainment organization, the skills of the sustainment team, the adaptability of the customer, and the operational domain of the team. Thus, software maintenance as well as operations should be consid-ered part of software sustainment...|$|R

During Stage III, a shift occurs from management of computers to management of data resources. This shift is an outcome of analysis of how to increase management control and planning in expending data processing operations.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the connection between}} the policy and culture of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), representation of women and the prevalence of sexual assault. I analyzed how the policies and discourse of the CAF contribute to the permissive environment for sexual assault within the institution. Through this analysis I have found that the policies of the CAF do not substantively represent victims and do not contribute to a change in culture. The CAF, as with any culture, is resistant to change and the outdated policies contribute to this. Policies, as a guiding factor in the behaviour of CAF members, must be updated to include clear, direct wording that is substantively representative of victims of sexual assault. Although new <b>documentation,</b> like <b>Operation</b> HONOUR has been recently released, the policies in the QR&Os and DAODs must be adjusted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe authors set {{the task}} to {{calculate}} and design the connection node of spatial rod constructions; the calculations {{were carried out}} {{in view of the}} geometrical and physical nonlinearity. To that effect, the solid-state node model was created and a numerical simulation was carried out. Based on calculation results, the authors obtained values of node deformations and equivalent stress, and completed their analysis. It was found that the node clamp disk, one of the node elements, undergoes a plastic deformation when subject to loadings. The node stiffness was enhanced by entering additional elements. Parameters of the enhanced node in the stress-strain state were re-calculated in a nonlinear formulation. The upgraded node construction can be recommended for the efficient industrial use. The proposed design technique allows the authors to evaluate structural behavior at all stages of the life cycle: model creation, preparation of design <b>documentation,</b> manufacture, <b>operation</b> in all modes and conditions...|$|R
