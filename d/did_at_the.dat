5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of his reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E

Heath McCormick dominated against Thomas Ulsrud, who lost second Christoffer Svae {{in the middle of}} the game due to illness. Kevin Martin established an early lead in the first half of the game versus Niklas Edin and held his lead to win. Glenn Howard had a chance to make the draw a North America sweep, starting off with a small lead against Tom Brewster, but a mistake in the eighth end from Brent Laing led to a chance for Brewster to come back and tie the game, which he <b>did.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, Team North America led Team World 13–8.|$|E
5|$|While North Korea {{had already}} begun to move from a foreign policy based upon proletarian internationalism at the Conference of Party Representatives in 1966, the WPK {{leadership}} had never explicitly broken with proletarian internationalism as it <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 6th Congress. In theory, a communist party supports policy contributing to the world revolution. Communist regimes rarely lived up to this ideal; by the 1950s, ideological schisms within the world communist movement made it all but impossible. From 1966 onwards, North Korea strengthened relations with neutral countries in the global Cold War. Proletarian internationalism was replaced with a national, independent foreign policy; if a socialist and non-socialist country were at war, North Korea could (in theory) support the non-socialist country if it benefited North Korea. At the 6th Congress, Kim Il-sung attached more importance to relations with Third World countries than to unity in the socialist camp. Nevertheless, North Korea still received massive funds and aid from the Soviet bloc, the People's Republic of China and relations with the United States would remain bitterly cold. While North Korea argues that independence and proletarian internationalism are not exclusive, in orthodox communist theory they are.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, though, was {{not happy}} with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held {{responsible}} for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth's Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a pyes] nest.' Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in Dartmouth.|$|E

25|$|With costs {{rising and}} {{revenues}} falling, General Manager Sir Felix Pole had told Chief Mechanical Engineer Charles Collett {{to develop more}} powerful economic designs, which lead to his adaption of his predecessor George Jackson Churchward's design, {{as opposed to the}} taking on board of new steam technology such as Sir William Stanier <b>did</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> London, Midland and Scottish Railway.
