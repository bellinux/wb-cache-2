60|$|Tregony is {{upon the}} same water {{north-east}} from Falmouth--distance about fifteen miles from it--but {{is a town}} of very little trade; nor, indeed, {{have any of the}} towns, so far within the shore, notwithstanding the benefit of the water, any considerable trade but what is carried on under the merchants of Falmouth or Truro. The chief thing that is to be said of this town is that it sends members to Parliament, as does also Grampound, a market-town; and Burro', about four miles farther up the water. This place, indeed, has a claim to antiquity, and is an appendix to the Duchy of Cornwall, of which it holds at a <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> <b>rent</b> and pays to the Prince of Wales as duke 10 pounds 11s. 1d. per annum. It has no parish church, but only a chapel-of-ease to an adjacent parish.|$|E

50|$|In English and Irish law, a <b>fee</b> <b>farm</b> {{grant is}} a hybrid type of land {{ownership}} typical {{in cities and}} towns.

[...] As a committed Catholic and private secretary to the Queen, his allegiance to King Charles was expected, but he did not declare until the siege of Gloucester. In 1642 Winter tried to send cartloads of armaments from his residence at Lydney to Gloucester, and the following year fortified his house against attack. [...] Following the relief of Gloucester by the Parliamentarians, he fought repeatedly with the forces of Colonel Massey, the governor of Gloucester. He was an unpopular commander, and a poor soldier, and lost repeatedly but always managed to escape.
