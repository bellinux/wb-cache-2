5|$|The <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the {{coronation}} have remained largely unchanged {{for the past}} thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E

25|$|Held {{that the}} word 'amendment' {{was used in the}} sense of {{permitting}} a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that the <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they hen, conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did not comprehend the power to totally abrogate or emasculate or damage any of the fundamental rights or the <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Working with non-disabled {{children}} in the Casa dei Bambini in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. The <b>essential</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> her educational theory emerged from this work, described in The Montessori Method in 1912 and in The Discovery of the Child in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs. Montessori {{came to the conclusion}} that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{rejected}} Massachusetts' {{argument that}} the analyst's reports were not accusatory. The respondent had argued that the reports were not accusatory {{because they did not}} implicate the defendant in a crime alone, but only when taken together with other evidence which linked the defendant to the contraband. The Court rejected this argument noting that the reports proved an <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the crime. The Court cited United States v. Kirby (1899). In Kirby, the Defendant was charged with receiving stolen property. The evidence at issue proved only that the property was stolen, but not the other <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the crime, that Kirby had received it. The Court noted that the Kirby decision was part of a long established rule that evidence that proves only one <b>essential</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> a crime is nevertheless accusatory for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.|$|R
