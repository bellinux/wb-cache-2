500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 50th anniversary of his 1930 graduation from Harvard College, Phelps said of all [...] his administrative duties at Harvard he [...] "found Extension the most rewarding. [...] Partly, this was, no doubt, because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> a rising program with practically no interference; partly it was the feeling that a second chance in education for people passed by in the normal run of school and college is one of the finest aspects of American education; and partly it was the chance to establish and maintain friendly relations thorough our programs with black people in Boston, who would otherwise have not have had any contact with Harvard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keselowski {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 102,000 people who attended the race. Keselowski also earned $186,770 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if we closed the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you could never get a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I could never get around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so that {{was the right thing to}} do, to start on the top and leave me on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mudge missed {{much of the}} 2005 season, first recuperating from an {{operation}} to rehabilitate a damaged knee which left her on crutches, and then succumbing to a bout of plantar fasciitis between May and July. Of her surgery, Mudge said: [...] "I'd worn away all my knee cartilage – {{more to do with}} my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my femur, so the surgeon drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> again. My knee was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a physiotherapist told me there were lots of people for whom the operation did not work." ...|$|E

6000|$|ROBERTS: 'Yes, I did. He hadn't got half-a-dozen rods away--it {{all took}} place in a flash--and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>run</b> him down. He was {{considerably}} larger than I--' ...|$|R
2500|$|Vaughn set a season-leading time of 6.54 {{seconds for}} the 60m at the Leonard Hilton Memorial in January 2015. He beat global sprint medallists Trell Kimmons and Mike Rodgers, then {{had his first}} {{national}} podium finish at the 2015 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships, taking third behind Marvin Bracy and Joseph Morris. His time ranked him 14th in the world rankings for the distance that year. The 100m final of the Sunbelt Conference Outdoor Championships was held on Mother's Day and he won the race in a big personal best of 9.93 seconds, becoming the 95th man to break the 10-second barrier. Vaughn dedicated the performance to his mother, saying [...] "my mom always believed that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> fast...But I never really saw it. I did it on a day where I could honor her". The time made him the fourth fastest American college athlete ever, after Ngoni Makusha, Davidson Ezinwa and Ato Boldon – who all later won World Championships medals. Vaughn was also third in the 200m and a relay winner at the Sunbelt Conference meet. He again reached the [...] final in the 100m at the 2015 NCAA Outdoor Championships, but was somewhat off his best in eighth place.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1999 autobiography, I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura {{suggested}} {{he did not}} plan on running for President of the United States but did not rule out such an idea. He spoke at Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul's [...] "Rally for the Republic", organized by the Campaign for Liberty, on September 2, 2008. At the event, Ventura implied a possible future run at the U.S. Presidency. At {{the end of his}} speech, Ventura announced before a live audience that if he saw that the public was willing to see a change {{in the direction of the}} country, then [...] "in 2012 we'll give them a race they'll never forget!" [...] In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul for the 2012 presidential elections if the latter decided to run as an independent. On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the Transportation Security Administration for what he claims are illegal searches of air travelers, that he was [...] "thinking about" [...] running for president. There had been reports that officials from the Libertarian Party have tried to persuade Ventura to run for the presidency on a Libertarian ticket although the party chairman Mark Hinkle said, [...] "Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He's thinking, ‘If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> as a presidential candidate in 2016." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A sol-dier must be a-ble {{to run as}} well as to fight," [...] protested Tik-Tok, [...] "and if my works run down, as they of-ten do, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> nei-ther <b>run</b> nor fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} thing, now," [...] said I. [...] "I am not the least afraid with you, yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>run</b> from the Miss Grants. And I was afraid of your cousin too." ...|$|R
2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>run.</b> Maybe <b>I</b> was worried my speed was going, and that was {{affecting}} my confidence, especially to counterattack." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> one car--if we didn't go too fast," [...] {{suggested}} Tom, {{who had run}} several {{machines at}} various times in his lively career.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dad; but I was {{too frightened}} to run. Not {{that it would have}} been any use if I had, for he was close to us before we knew what was the matter; and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>run,</b> <b>I</b> don't think Emma could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of them, I was so frightened," [...] said David apologetically. [...] "I just lit up {{a fire in the}} kitchen stove as quick's <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and <b>run.</b> It rattled me to hear Zillah moaning so's you could hear her all over the house." ...|$|R
2500|$|... or {{the life}} of me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>run</b> to get it. It seemed like an age before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the ball {{in my hands and}} then, as I looked over to first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "What fun you'd have! I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> off too," [...] said Jo, forgetting {{her part}} of mentor in lively visions of martial {{life at the}} capital.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no need to}} keep {{accounts}} {{and that sort of}} thing if there's no assistant. I daresay <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> a shop all right if I wasn't interfered with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am {{not afraid}} of Hartilaf," [...] replied Fiddlecumdoo, boldly. [...] "If {{he should not be}} {{pleasant}} to me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> away from him on my wheel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to say that, but of course you can't like it! I was sure you would n't like it. But what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do?

6000|$|... "That {{brings me}} to something, Cynthia," [...] said Jeff, [...] "and I don't want you to say {{anything}} till I've got through. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help mother <b>run</b> the place as well as Jackson, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stay here next winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will try}} to forgive me that. It was a trifle brutal," [...] he said, and his voice sank. [...] "Still, to be quite honest, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} think that any risk <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>could</b> cause you very much anxiety." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when the}} ground was white with snow, [...] And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> and slide, [...] My brother John was forced to go, [...] And he lies by her side." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} you would, and <b>I</b> really <b>could</b> <b>run</b> in those days.

6000|$|... "I {{could not}} give up my work at all," [...] he told her, [...] "for two years. I get a very large income from my company, and I have an {{agreement}} with them.

6000|$|... "Much better, much better, thank you.

5000|$|In 2006, the Maryland Constitution Party disaffiliated {{from the}} {{national}} party along with other state parties following a schism at the national party's 2006 convention, in which it failed to disaffiliate the Nevada party despite its chairman and gubernatorial candidate's support for legal abortion in some cases.
