5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal</b> on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa near <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal</b> on September7. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September13, the wave moved through the Windward Islands, producing wind gusts of 50mph (85km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75mi (120km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September14 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta {{to the north of the}} Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} {{associated with}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) left the coast of West Africa on August 9, producing mid-level winds of 75mph (120km/h) in <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal.</b> A weak circulation formed near the sea surface on August10 within an area of thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly westward over the Atlantic Ocean, developing into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August12, around the 10th parallel north, an unusually southern latitude the cyclone would remain around throughout its lifetime. On August13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma about 375mi (605km) east of Trinidad and Tobago, as indicated by a Hurricane Hunters flight reporting winds of 65mph (105km/h). This same flight observed a circular eye with a diameter of , the only report of an eye-like structure from this storm.|$|E

They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} in Florida included at least 2,500fatalities {{in the state of}} Florida, making this the second deadliest tropical cyclone {{in the history of the}} United States, behind only the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The hurricane originated from a tropical depression that formed near <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal,</b> on September6. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone struck the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas as a powerful hurricane. Early on September17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, as a Category4 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Thereafter, it moved further inland across the Southeastern United States and became extratropical over North Carolina on September20, before the remnants lost their identity over Ontario on September21.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, the RUF {{blocked the}} road {{connecting}} Freetown to Lungi Airport, prompting UNAMSIL staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel {{in preparation for}} a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards Freetown. In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal,</b> to decrease the time required to launch an operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E

5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde observations from various nations {{for two days}} before being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting observations from <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal,</b> made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E
5|$|On September6, ships {{reported}} a tropical depression developing {{just off the}} west coast of Africa near <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal.</b> The next day, a ship reported winds of 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm status; on this basis, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September6. However, lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On September10, the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900miles (1450km) to the east of Guadeloupe, which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. Later that day, two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm, and the Hurricane Research Division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00UTC on September10.|$|E
5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. <b>Dakar,</b> <b>Senegal,</b> received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States {{a few days after the}} storm's recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.|$|E
