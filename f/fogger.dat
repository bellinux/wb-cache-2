5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito <b>fogger</b> and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Covert Operations, Klepacki {{composed}} Hell March {{from the idea}} of [...] "a rock tune to marching boots," [...] finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff. Upon listening, director Brett Sperry insisted this song be used as the signature theme of Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored Red Alert with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the Red Alert team to expand upon the style of Command & Conquer. In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like Workmen and Crush, then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as Vector and Roll Out. Klepacki scored <b>Fogger</b> and Mud, one of his personal favorites, before finishing with Militant Force and Radio 2. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by Kane and an Allied commander in the cut scenes of Red Alert. He previously appeared as a Nod soldier and the voice of the commando in Command & Conquer and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.|$|E
5000|$|Total release <b>foggers</b> (TRFs) (also called [...] "bug bombs") {{are used}} to kill cockroaches, fleas, and flying insects by filling an area with insecticide. Most <b>foggers</b> contain pyrethroid, pyrethrin, or both as active ingredients. Pyrethroids are a class of {{synthetic}} insecticides that are chemically similar to natural pyrethrins and have low potential for systemic toxicity in mammals. Pyrethrins are insecticides derived from chrysanthemum flowers (pyrethrum). Piperonyl butoxide and n-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide often are added to pyrethrin products to inhibit insects' microsomal enzymes that detoxify pyrethrins. To distribute their insecticide, <b>foggers</b> also contain aerosol propellants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Foggers</b> tells Hilb to stay {{guard on}} the local hotel while he and the {{shoemaker}} head for the brothel. As Cole and company approach the place, they are spotted by Hilb, who barricades inside his room. Instead of trying to storm in, Cole and Copperud decide {{to keep an eye}} from the room across the hallway and wait until <b>Foggers</b> returns. Next morning, in spite of their plans, Hilb manages to escape the hotel, leading to a gunfight that results in the thief dropping his half of the gold and running away from town. <b>Foggers</b> then enters the fray, and in the confusion, Ben manages to flee with the loot. Cole, Copperud and <b>Foggers</b> set out in pursuit, only to enter head on in Shipley's campfire; Ben is already there.|$|R

50|$|During 2001-2006, a {{total of}} 466 fogger-related {{illnesses}} or injuries were identified in the United States by the SENSOR-Pesticides program. These illnesses or injuries often resulted from inability or failure to vacate before the <b>fogger</b> discharged, reentry into the treated space too soon after the <b>fogger</b> was discharged, excessive use of foggers for the space being treated, and failure to notify others nearby.|$|E

50|$|<b>Foggers</b> {{fulfill a}} similar role to mist {{sprayers}} in producing particles of very small size, but {{use a different}} method. Whereas mist sprayers create a high-speed stream of air which can travel significant distances, <b>foggers</b> use a piston or bellows to create a stagnant area of pesticide that is often used for enclosed areas, such as houses and animal shelters.|$|R

50|$|A <b>fogger</b> is any {{device that}} creates a fog, {{typically}} containing an insecticide for killing insects and other arthropods. Foggers are often used by consumers as a low cost alternative to professional pest control services. The number of foggers needed for pest control depends {{on the size of}} the space to be treated, as stated for safety reasons on the instructions supplied with the devices. The fog may contain flammable gases, leading to a danger of explosion if a <b>fogger</b> is used in a building with a pilot light or other naked flame.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the fogging application of Rejex-it ® TP- 40. Much has been learned about the type of fog generated by these machines and the resulting efficiency. Many <b>foggers</b> have been proven to deliver the product in the desired form, while others were only useful under special conditions, but no single piece of equipment is suitable for all situations. Generally, thermal <b>foggers</b> (e. g., Golden Eagle) produce the best fog with a good droplet size in areas where they can be employed. Their drawback for many operations by a trained technician is the noise they generate and the open flames during operation. Battery operated ULV <b>foggers</b> are quiet and can be fully automated, even in remote areas, which is a requirement for agricultural applications. Also, they tend to generate a fog that is less visible, so that birds cannot see the reason for the unpleasant experience. Newer machines with automation (e. g., BICO 2000) are not only capable to cover large areas with a minimum of product, but also can produce a fog that is nearly invisible and similar to thermal <b>foggers</b> in droplet size (e. g. ...|$|R
500|$|Total release <b>foggers</b> (TRFs), or [...] "bug bombs," [...] {{release a}} fog of {{insecticide}} to kill bugs {{in a room}} and coat surfaces with a chemical so the insects do not return. [...] It is estimated that 50 million TRFs are used in the US annually. [...] SENSOR-Pesticides federal and state staff, along with officials from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), published an article in the CDC MMWR that called attention to injuries and illnesses resulting from use of total release <b>foggers.</b> The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) published a press release in response, stating that the state would restrict their use. [...] DEC Commissioner Pete Granis announced that the department would move to classify <b>foggers</b> as a restricted-use product in New York State, meaning that only certified pesticide applicators would be able to obtain them. [...] In March 2010, US EPA announced required label changes on indoor TRF products that reflect the label change recommendations made in the MMWR article.|$|R

50|$|An {{obsolete}} {{method for}} creating theatrical fog on-stage (although {{the technique is}} still commonly used in motion) {{is to use a}} device known as a thermal <b>fogger,</b> initially designed for distributing pesticide, which aspirates a petroleum product (typically kerosene or propane), ignites the fuel, and then mixes in air and pesticide to create a dense fog. For theatrical purposes the pesticide is typically replaced with glycol, glycol/water mixtures, or water. This technique is similar to the smoke generators used by militaries to create smoke screens, and is generally only used outdoors due to the volume of fog produced and the petroleum fuel required.|$|E
50|$|Sanders first played when he {{had picked}} up his older brother's bass and decided to try it out, even though the bass was strung for a lefty, and he was right-handed. A few months later, he had talked his dad into buying him a bass. He started first playing in such bands as Four Hour <b>Fogger,</b> Knuckle and Puaka Balava. In 1995, Sanders joined the grindcore-band Social Infestation as the bass player. Social Infestation has {{released}} one EP and two full length albums. The band hasn't released any material since 2000 and are seemingly taking a long hiatus or the band has split.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{microclimate}} alteration on temperature-humidity index (THI), milk yield, and milk composition of Murrah buffaloes during summer for a period of 90 -day from March to May- 2014 at Buffalo Research Station, Venkataramannagudem, Andhra Pradesh, India. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 lactating Murrah buffaloes were selected having similar body weight, parity, and milk yield. They were divided into four groups of 10 each. Three groups of buffaloes were provided with microclimate alteration using supplemental cooling like <b>foggers,</b> fans and <b>foggers</b> plus fans, and the fourth group (control) was without any cooling system. The daily THI was measured using dry and wet bulb thermometer. The physiological responses viz. rectal temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were measured by a clinical thermometer, measuring the flank movements a minute and observing the pulsation of the middle coccygeal artery at the base of tail with the help of finger. Milk samples were analyzed for chemical composition viz., fat, solids-not-fat (SNF), total solids (TS), specific gravity. Results: In the present study, significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in the average THI values were observed in experimental Murrah buffalo houses of GroupII (<b>foggers),</b> GroupIII (fans), and GroupIV (<b>foggers</b> and fans) compared to GroupI (control). Significant (p< 0. 001) decrease in average rectal temperature (°F), respiration rate (breaths/min) and pulse rate (beats/min) values were recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III and IV compared to Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk yield (kg/day) was recorded in Murrah buffaloes of Groups II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the average milk fat, SNF, and TS percent were recorded in Murrah buffalo Groups of II, III, and IV compared with Group I. Conclusion: Microclimate alteration by the provision of <b>foggers</b> and air circulators in the buffalo houses increased feed intake in buffaloes resulting increased milk production, fat and SNF yield which was due to decreased heat stress in buffaloes...|$|R
