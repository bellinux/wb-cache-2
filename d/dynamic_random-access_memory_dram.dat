By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E

However, {{the limited data}} retention time of these dynamic bitcells results in the need for power-consuming periodic refresh cycles. This Letter measures the impact of body biasing as a control factor to improve the retention time of a 2 kb memory block, and also examines {{the distribution of the}} retention time across the entire gain-cell array. The concept is demonstrated through silicon measurements of a test chip manufactured in a logic-compatible 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Although there is a large retention time spread across the measured 2 kb gain-cell array, the minimum, average and maximum retention times are all improved by up to two orders of magnitude when sweeping the body voltage over a range of 375 mV...|$|R

Boise is the home of Micron Technology, the only U.S.manufacturer of <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>DRAM)</b> chips. Micron at one time manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success.

Boise-based Clearwater Analytics is another rapidly growing investment accounting and reporting software firm, reporting on over $1 trillion in assets. ON Semiconductor, whose worldwide headquarters in Pocatello, is a widely recognized innovator in modern integrated mixed-signal semiconductor products, mixed-signal foundry services, and structured digital products. Coldwater Creek, a women's clothing retailer, is headquartered in Sandpoint. Sun Microsystems (now a part of Oracle Corporation) has two offices in Boise and a parts depot in Pocatello.

2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>DRAM)</b> {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input. [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1981, MOS Technology, Inc., Commodore's {{integrated}} circuit design subsidiary, initiated {{a project to}} design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation video game console. Design work for the chips, named MOS Technology VIC-II (Video Integrated Circuit for graphics) and MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device for audio), was completed in November 1981. Commodore then began a game console project that would use the new chips—called the Ultimax or the Commodore MAX Machine, engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled {{after just a few}} machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. At the same time, Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Russell (system programmer and architect on the VIC-20) and Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the Commodore PET line aimed at business users. With the support of Al Charpentier (engineer of the VIC-II) and Charles Winterble (manager of MOS Technology), they proposed to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel a true low-cost sequel to the VIC-20. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have [...] of random-access memory (RAM). Although 64-Kbit <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>DRAM)</b> chips cost over [...] at the time, he knew that DRAM prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. The team was able to quickly design the computer because, unlike most other home-computer companies, Commodore had its own semiconductor fab to produce test chips; because the fab was not running at full capacity, development costs were part of existing corporate overhead. The chips were complete by November, by which time Charpentier, Winterble, and Tramiel had decided to proceed with the new computer; the latter set a final deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).|$|E

40|$|As overall <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> {{capacity}} and performance {{continue to increase}} and improve, innovation is keeping pace to make basic cells smaller, faster, more reliable, and simpler. Two novel bipolar <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (B-dRAM) cells are proposed, investigated, and analyzed. One cell incorporates three diodes in a composite structure and the other employs an npn transistor and a diode. Each of the basic cells consists of the junction capacitor, where data is stored {{in the form of}} charge, and the switching devices acting as a transfer gate. An open bit line organized array of cells is proposed with a simple sense/latch scheme and a dummy cell employed as a reference potential. This array organization can double the basic cells per sense/latch circuit as compared with a single-ended sense scheme. ^ For the completeness of this thesis, the development of metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and of bipolar <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> are reviewed with emphasis on the memory basic cell structures in terms of cross-sectional and equivalent circuit view points, and including the sense/latch amplifier.

50|$|A {{memory bank}} {{is a logical}} unit of storage in electronics, which is hardware-dependent.

In a typical synchronous <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (SDRAM) or double data rate synchronous <b>dynamic</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (DDR SDRAM), a bank consists of multiple rows and columns of storage units, and is usually spread out across several chips. In a single read or write operation, only one bank is accessed, therefore the number of bits in a column or a row, per bank and per chip, equals the memory bus width in bits (single channel). The size of a bank is further determined by the number of bits in a column and a row, per chip, multiplied by the number of chips in a bank.|$|R
