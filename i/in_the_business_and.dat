5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business,</b> <b>and</b> Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
