25|$|Epigenetic {{modifications}} {{also play}} a role in neurological disorders. Deregulation of histones modification are found to be responsible for deregulated gene expression and hence associated with neurological and psychological disorders, such as Schizophrenia and <b>Huntington</b> <b>disease.</b> Current studies indicate that inhibitors of the HDAC family have therapeutic benefits {{in a wide range of}} neurological and psychiatric disorders.

25|$|Another {{problematic}} case is {{the cases}} of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as <b>Huntington</b> <b>disease.</b> It is applied when patients {{do not wish to}} know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of 4 -month of {{respiratory}} muscle training on pulmonary and swallowing function, exercise capacity and dyspnoea in manifest patients with <b>Huntingtons</b> <b>disease.</b> Design: A pilot randomised controlled trial. Setting: Home based training program. Participants: Eighteen manifest <b>Huntingtons</b> <b>disease</b> patients with a positive genetic test and clinically verified disease expression, were randomly assigned to control group (n= 9) and training group (n= 9). Intervention: Both groups received home-based inspiratory (5 sets of 5 repetitions) and expiratory (5 sets of 5 repetitions) muscle training 6 times a week for 4 months. The control group used a fixed resistance of 9 centimeters of water, and the training group used a progressively increased resistance from 30 % to 75 % of each patients maximum respiratory pressure. Main measures: Spirometric indices, maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, six minutes walk test, dyspnoea, water-swallowing test and swallow quality of life questionnaire were assessed before, at 2 and 4 months after training. Results: The magnitude of increases in maximum inspiratory (d= 2. 9) and expiratory pressures (d= 1. 5), forced vital capacity (d= 0. 8), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (d= 0. 9) and peak expiratory flow (d= 0. 8) was substantially greater for the training group in comparison to the control group. Changes in swallowing function, dyspnoea and exercise capacity were small (d′ 0. 5) for both groups without substantial differences between groups. Conclusions: A home-based respiratory muscle training program appeared to be beneficial to improve pulmonary function in manifest Huntington’s disease patients but provided small effects on swallowing function, dyspnoea and exercise capacity...|$|R

Misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins, which {{are behind the}} initiation and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases (ND), are known to challenge the proteostasis network of the cells. We aimed to explore the role of DNJ- 27 /ERdj 5, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident thioredoxin protein required as a disulfide reductase for the degradation of misfolded proteins, in well-established Caenorhabditis elegans models of Alzheimer, Parkinson and <b>Huntington</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results: We demonstrate that DNJ- 27 is an ER luminal protein and that its expression is induced upon ER stress via IRE- 1 /XBP- 1. When dnj- 27 expression is downregulated by RNA interference we find {{an increase in the}} aggregation and associated pathological phenotypes (paralysis and motility impairment) caused by human β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), α-synuclein (α-syn) and polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins. In turn, DNJ- 27 overexpression ameliorates these deleterious phenotypes. Surprisingly, despite being an ER-resident protein, we show that dnj- 27 downregulation alters cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and causes mitochondrial fragmentation. We further demonstrate that DNJ- 27 overexpression substantially protects against the mitochondrial fragmentation caused by human Aβ and α-syn peptides in these worm models. Innovation: We identify C. elegans dnj- 27 as a novel protective gene for the toxicity associated with the expression of human Aβ, α-syn and polyQ proteins, implying a protective role of ERdj 5 in Alzheimer, Parkinson and <b>Huntington</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusion: Our data support a scenario where the levels of DNJ- 27 /ERdj 5 in the ER impact cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and the integrity of the mitochondrial network which might underlie its protective effects in models of proteotoxicity associated to human ND...|$|R

In particular, recently published studies about skeletal muscle malfunction and HD-related cardiomyopathy in HD mouse models strongly suggest their important roles, leading to upcoming preclinical and clinical trials.
