40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare {{clinical}} characteristics, management, complications, in-hospital outcome and mortality of diabetic and nondiabetic patients after the first episode of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This retrospective case-matched study included 60 diabetic and 55 non-diabetic patients. Medical information about patients was retrieved <b>from</b> the <b>hospital</b> <b>recordings.</b> Diabetic patients were older, were more hypertensive and had more coronary artery disease history than nondiabetic patients. The frequency of use of acute reperfusion therapy modalities was not statistically different between the two groups. Diabetes was a significant determinant against the use of beta blockers (OR= 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 95) but in favor of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (OR= 3. 3; 95 % CI 1. 17 - 9. 36), whereas diabetes did not influence the use of other drugs. Diabetic patients had more complications than nondiabetic patients (40. 0 % and 16. 3 %, respectively, p= 0. 005). In-hospital mortality rate for diabetic patients was comparable to nondiabetic patients (16. 7 % and 10. 9 %, respectively, p= 0. 373). Pharmaceutical treatment regimens, particularly beta blockers, are underutilized after acute MI in diabetic patients. More frequent use of these regimens will improve the high complication and mortality rates in diabetic patients as well as in nondiabetic patients...|$|R

30|$|Our {{study found}} that {{patients}} who were transferred <b>from</b> other <b>hospitals</b> to our center had less hospital and ICU mortality compared with those with direct admission <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> wards but similar to those with direct admission from ED. Patients transferred <b>from</b> other <b>hospitals</b> had lower severity of illness compared with patients with direct admission <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> wards but similar to those with direct admission from ED. However, transferred patients did not have higher risk-adjusted mortality compared with nontransferred patients. Increasing severity of illness and chronic liver disease were independent predictors of increased hospital mortality in patients transferred <b>from</b> other <b>hospitals.</b>|$|R

Patients with direct admission <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> wards were usually nontrauma patients, because trauma patients come to ICU through ED or <b>from</b> other <b>hospitals.</b> Patients who were admitted from the operating room and recovery room were excluded because of major differences in their course and outcome from transferred patients.|$|R

Sandford 2 This article {{presents the results}} of a Cochrane review which was conducted to determine the effectiveness of providing written and verbal health information compared with verbal in-formation only to patients being discharged <b>from</b> acute <b>hospital</b> settings to home. Only two trials met the review inclusion criteria. In both trials the participants were parents of children being discharged <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home. The two outcomes measured in both trials were knowledge and satisfaction. The review confirms that providing written and verbal health in-formation is more effective in improving knowl-edge and satisfaction than providing verbal information only for parents of children being discharged <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention in adults who provide their own care after dis-charge <b>from</b> <b>hospital.</b> Further research is re-quired which involves adult patients being discharged <b>from</b> <b>hospital</b> to home, and research which measures a range of outcomes which in-clude readmission rates, recovery times, patient/ carer knowledge, complication rates, service utilization and costs (community, outpatient and inpatient), confidence in one’s owncareman-agement, stress and anxiety levels, satisfaction with services provided prior to discharge, and adherence to recommended care...|$|R
