25|$|With the {{exception}} of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms and batons. A criticism that has emerged <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> that police officers generally do not carry any nonlethal weapons aside from batons such as tasers or pepper spray, limiting their options when dealing with violent criminals. Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for many}} of those sites, even {{confirmation}} as to whether Orthalicus reses reses persists <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> lacking. Survey and monitoring efforts have been limited and highly variable, and methodologies are usually not reported in detail. Whereas Orthalicus reses reses occupies more sites at present than in the recorded past, the total area occupied remains unknown, as are trends in abundance and demographics. Overall, however, the Orthalicus reses reses population status {{appears to be more}} secure than when it was listed, due to the widespread translocations that occurred subsequently.|$|E
25|$|A common {{variant of}} the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this {{depiction}} at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a baresman in hand and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly {{thought to be a}} depiction of Zoroaster, but <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.|$|E

25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in mining methods (e.g. {{longwall}} mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as safety-lamps or {{more modern}} electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, electrical equipment, and ventilation have reduced {{many of the}} risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with gas engines. Another innovation <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries {{by more than half}} and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.|$|E
25|$|The IFRC {{coordinates}} {{cooperation between}} national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies {{throughout the world}} and supports the foundation of new national societies in countries where no official society exists. On the international stage, the IFRC organizes and leads relief assistance missions after emergencies such as natural disasters, manmade disasters, epidemics, mass refugee flights, and other emergencies. As per the 1997 Seville Agreement, the IFRC is the Lead Agency of the Movement in any emergency situation which does not take place {{as part of an}} armed conflict. The IFRC cooperates with the national societies of those countries affected– each called the Operating National Society (ONS)– as well as the national societies of other countries willing to offer assistance– called Participating National Societies (PNS). Among the 187 national societies admitted to the General Assembly of the International Federation as full members or observers, about 25–30 regularly work as PNS in other countries. The most active of those are the American Red Cross, the British Red Cross, the German Red Cross, and the Red Cross societies of Sweden and Norway. Another major mission of the IFRC which has gained attention <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> its commitment to work towards a codified, worldwide ban on the use of land mines and to bring medical, psychological, and social support for people injured by land mines.|$|E

[...] With Lincoln's population expected to grow to more than 311,000 people by 2020, prices for homes and rent costs have risen. [...] Home prices rose 10% from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016; rent prices rose 30% from 2007 to 2017 with a 5–8% increase in 2016 alone.|$|E
500|$|Gari Nunnery {{is located}} north of Lhasa. The nunnery has an ancient history {{traced to the}} 11th century when Pha dam pa sangs rgyas), the Buddhist preceptor, visited this location.

Many of the protesting nuns were arrested, incarcerated, brutally handled and released only after protracted detention.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prognosis}} of thyroid {{cancer is}} related to the type of cancer and the stage at the time of diagnosis. [...] For {{the most common form of}} thyroid cancer, papillary, the overall prognosis is excellent. Indeed, the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> likely related to increased and earlier diagnosis. One can look at the trend to earlier diagnosis in two ways. The first is that many of these cancers are small and not likely to develop into aggressive malignancies. A second perspective is that earlier diagnosis removes these cancers at a time when they are not likely to have spread beyond the thyroid gland, thereby improving the long-term outcome for the patient. There is no consensus at present on whether this trend toward earlier diagnosis is beneficial or unnecessary.|$|E

2500|$|Leeds and St Helens {{is arguably}} the {{greatest}} rivalry of the two Yorkshire clubs that have history with St Helens. They have contested the last three Super League finals, but the rugby they have produced <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> considered amongst the best in Super League. The derby is also sometimes considered a contest in terms of pride between the two counties. Leeds and St Helens have also a historical background, contesting the 1971—72 and 1977—78 Challenge Cup Finals, each team winning one each. However, the derby is often noted for its bad behaviour—on and off the field. Especially recently, with incidents like the Ryan Bailey [...] "chicken wing" [...] tackle on Maurie Fa'asavalu in 2008, the presence of James Graham when the two meet, {{as well as the}} numerous fights that have broke out between the two sets of players, the game is certainly regarded as a feisty one, as well as one that produces good-to-watch rugby. Such activities off the field and between games like fights between supporters, has led to some fans being discouraged from attending the fixture at Knowsley Road; shown by somewhat disappointing crowd figures, such as an example of 11,048 in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|From its {{inception}} R has been criticised {{for being an}} agency not answerable {{to the people of}} India (R reports to Prime Minister only). Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R's able leadership (although detractors of R and especially the Janata Party have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during the 1975–1977 Emergency). The main controversy which has plagued R <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability, inter-departmental rivalry etc. R also suffers from ethnic imbalances in the officer level.
