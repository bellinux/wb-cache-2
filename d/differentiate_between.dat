5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
5|$|Although {{onset of}} DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, {{in more than}} half of all cases {{symptoms}} do not begin to appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E
5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E
5|$|Currently, only cattle {{recorded}} in the French Limousin Certified Purebred sub-class 2 and Registered Purebred class satisfy the requirements of EU law on herd books and can be transferred as Limousins, including indirectly through their genetics (for example semen and embryos), to other EU countries and {{recorded in}} the respective herd books. Outside of the EU, {{the rules and regulations}} of Limousin breed associations do not yet <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> the French Pureblood and Purebred classes, with the Pureblood class remaining the origin of, and standard for, the purest form of Limousin.|$|E
5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E

5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> ground and aerial predators. For {{instance}} an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E

5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of Kraków's president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters.

Early records of Myotis ikonnikovi—now known to be an eastern Asian species—from Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species.

5|$|Tapaculos are {{the most}} {{primitive}} family of suboscines, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. Scytalopus, the genus to which the Perijá tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, {{many of which are}} difficult to classify through appearance. Some individual species from other genera are like Scytalopus in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and morphological features. Vocal studies and mitochondrial DNA analysis are often used to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as subspecies of the Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) have been identified through these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|The {{nationwide}} census {{conducted in}} 2 AD, listed 1,587 counties. The Han county was the smallest political division containing a centrally appointed official. In larger counties of about 10,000 households {{he was known}} as the Prefect (Ling 令); in smaller counties {{he was known as}} the Chief (Zhang 長). Depending {{on the size of the}} county, the Prefect's salary-rank was 600-dan or 1,000-dan, while a Chief was ranked at 300-dan or 500-dan. Due to their judicial role, historian Rafe de Crespigny does not <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> Prefects and Chiefs, referring to both as magistrate. The county's head civil servants, usually respected scholars or elders in their local communities, were appointed directly by the Magistrate.|$|E
