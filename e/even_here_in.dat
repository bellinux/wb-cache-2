Yousafzai later sympathised, and acknowledged that problems are faced by young {{people all over the}} world, saying [...] "there are problems in Mexico, there are problems even in America, <b>even</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Norway, and it is really important that children raise their voices".|$|E
2500|$|A {{reviewer}} for {{the publication}} Bright Sights {{wrote that the}} film had a powerfully downbeat conclusion with a social message:"Projecting overwhelming grief, Beban reveals some hefty acting chops, and The Italian certainly gets its liberal point across, a model of how American movies dress social consciousness in the garb of melodrama. <b>Even</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> its infancy, feature film was eager {{to pick up the}} call for social reform that sounded out in urban America before the First World War." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979 the US Department of Energy sued to {{suppress}} the publication of an article by Howard Morland in The Progressive magazine detailing design information on thermonuclear and fission nuclear weapons {{he was able to}} glean in conversations with officials at several DoE contractor plants active in manufacture of nuclear weapons components. [...] Ray Kidder, a nuclear weapon designer testifying for Morland, identified several open literature sources for the information Morland repeated in his article , while aviation historian Chuck Hansen produced a similar document for US Senator Charles Percy [...] [...] Morland and The Progressive won the case, and Morland published a book on his journalistic research for the article, the trial, and a technical appendix in which he [...] "corrected" [...] what he felt were false assumptions in his original article about the design of thermonuclear weapons in his book, The Secret That Exploded. [...] The concepts in Morland's book are widely acknowledged in other popular-audience descriptions of the inner workings of thermonuclear weapons, <b>even</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Wikipedia.|$|E

60|$|But if {{you have}} half {{forgotten}} Mariposa, and long since lost the way to it, you are only like {{the greater part of}} the men <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this Mausoleum Club in the city.

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from his failed relationship with Regine. [...] For {{a time in}} between their break-up and her marriage to Schlegel, they had polite and civil contact during daily walks and in church. [...] These were mostly non-verbal on Kierkegaard's part and caused him great anxiety. [...] It seems that he was attempting to utilize his complicated authorial method of indirect communication in his personal life, and his tormented approach caused him great distress. [...] When he absconded to Berlin in 1842 to study philosophy, he was haunted {{by a woman who}} bore an uncanny resemblance to Regine. Even while immersing himself in his studies, Regine was always on his mind: [...] "Not <b>even</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Berlin has my, alas, all-too-inventive brain been able to refrain from scheming something or other. She must either love me or hate me, she knows no third possibility. Nor is there anything more harmful to a young girl than half-way situations." [...] It was during this time that Kierkegaard was formulating his own philosophy, as well as his first book, Either/Or.|$|E

40|$|Six adult female albino rats were {{subjected}} to operations known to increase the frequency of wheel-running. Operations included limited access to wheel, food deprivation, and protracted maintenance on a 24 -hr feeding schedule. A distributional analysis of response duration, burst duration, and inter-burst interval showed that the increased frequency in all cases arose mainly from a shortening of the interval between successive bursts. Only short-term food deprivation produced any notable increase in burst length, and <b>even</b> <b>here</b> changes <b>in</b> both speed of the individual responses and in number of responses per burst were slight compared to changes in inter-burst interval...|$|R

However, insufficient attention is paid to the theoretical generalization of this experience. In recent years no special monographs were published devoted to the investigation of national economic connections and proportions, to methods of studying the process of socialist reproduction.
