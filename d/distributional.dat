Other species in the genus occur through Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and across Central Asia as far east as northwestern India. The populations of P.fluviatile on the Peloponnese, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos may {{represent}} a separate, cryptic species, and the population from the Peloponnese was described in 2010 as P.pelops.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} famines, {{the causes of}} the Bangladesh famine were multiple. These {{included}} flooding, government mismanagement of foodgrain stocks, legislation restricting movement of foodgrains between districts, foodgrain smuggling to neighbouring countries and so called <b>distributional</b> failures. The famine did not occur among all areas and populations but was concentrated in specific areas; particularly those hit by flooding.|$|E
25|$|Spatial ecology {{represents}} the ultimate <b>distributional</b> or spatial unit {{occupied by a}} species. In a particular habitat shared by several species, each of the species is usually confined to its own micro habitat or spatial niche because two species in the same general territory cannot usually occupy the same ecological niche for any significant length of time.|$|E
25|$|One {{could even}} {{say that in the}} years before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: because of the economic growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in <b>distributional</b> trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major <b>distributional</b> hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure of the labor market, high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Hayek’s ideas {{find their}} way into the {{discussion}} of the post-Great Recession issues of secular stagnation. Monetary policy and mounting regulation is argued to have undermined the innovative forces of the market economies. Quantitative easing following the financial crises is argued to have not only conserved structural distortions in the economy, leading to a fall in trend-growth; it also created new distortions and contributes to <b>distributional</b> conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillar}} outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so, with the precise interval varying somewhat {{in time and}} space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's <b>distributional</b> range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization {{is thought to be}} due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Distributional</b> {{learning}} {{has also been}} found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants {{who were exposed to}} a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} learning device {{has also}} been proposed {{as a component of}} syntactical acquisition for young children. Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on <b>distributional</b> information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.|$|E
25|$|The Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) is a {{web based}} {{workbench}} and database supporting the acquisition, storage, analysis, and publication of DNA barcode records. By assembling molecular, morphological, and <b>distributional</b> data, it bridges a traditional bioinformatics chasm. BOLD {{is the most}} prominently used barcoding software and is freely available to any researcher with interests in DNA barcoding. By providing specialized services, it aids the assembly of records that meet the standards needed to gain BARCODE designation in the global sequence databases. Because of its web-based delivery and flexible data security model, it is also well positioned to support projects that involve broad research alliances.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{and the northern}} <b>distributional</b> limits for rhesus and bonnet macaques, respectively, currently run {{parallel to each other}} in the western part of India, are separated by a large gap in the center, and converge on the eastern coast of the peninsula to form a distribution overlap zone. This overlap region is characterized by the presence of mixed-species troops, with pure troops of both species sometimes occurring even in close proximity to one another. The range extension of rhesus macaque – a natural process in some areas, and a direct consequence of introduction by humans in other regions – poses grave implications for the endemic and declining populations of bonnet macaques in southern India.|$|E
25|$|Post-emergence, {{females have}} a pre-oviposition period {{of one to}} two days. Using their ovipositor, females lay single eggs within the plant tissue, and may lay an average of forty eggs during their lifetime. Females of S. dorsalis prefer to lay their eggs inside of young leaves and buds at the apical {{meristem}} of plants, but as populations increase, will lay their eggs within the surface of mature leaves. Depending on temperature, eggs may gestate for one to three weeks. After hatching, larvae will migrate from older leaves to the newer growth at terminals. Like many thrips, S. dorsalis appears to prefer feeding on new growth and young plants, and is often found on the newer top leaves on smaller plants, although individual plant morphology and chemistry may result in some <b>distributional</b> differences.|$|E

Its geographical range was also greater than that of older works, notably in the inclusion of Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|As {{defined by}} Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales in 2009, the {{subspecies}} Oryzomys couesi mexicanus occurs along the Pacific coast from central Sonora to southeastern Oaxaca and inland along rivers into central Michoacán, southern Morelos, southern Puebla, and northwestern Oaxaca. It usually lives below [...] altitude, {{but has been}} found at [...] in Jalisco. This <b>distributional</b> pattern {{is similar to that}} of other western Mexican rodents such as Sigmodon mascotensis, Hodomys alleni, Peromyscus perfulvus, and Osgoodomys banderanus and has been recognized as a distinct biogeographic zone in some reviews. O.c.mexicanus occurs close to three other Oryzomys species—O.albiventer, O.peninsulae, and O.nelsoni—which are larger and different in some proportions and details of coloration.|$|E
500|$|This genus {{is often}} {{described}} as cosmopolitan, meaning it has worldwide distribution. The botanist Ludwig Diels, author of the only monograph of the family to date, called this description an [...] "arrant misjudgment of this genus' highly unusual <b>distributional</b> circumstances (arge Verkennung ihrer höchst eigentümlichen Verbreitungsverhältnisse)", while admitting sundew species do [...] "occupy {{a significant part of the}} Earth's surface (einen beträchtlichen Teil der Erdoberfläche besetzt)". He particularly pointed to the absence of Drosera species from almost all arid climate zones, countless rainforests, the American Pacific Coast, Polynesia, the Mediterranean region, and North Africa, as well as the scarcity of species diversity in temperate zones, such as Europe and North America.|$|E

Nepenthes hurrelliana and N. murudensis are two examples of species that have a putative hybrid origin. Nepenthes × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis are sufficiently stabilised that a species status has been discussed.

500|$|Although {{the music}} video aspect of Yankovic's songs {{had long been}} a part of his success, RCA Records opted not to fund any video {{production}} for Mandatory Fun. Yankovic instead turned to various social media portals including Funny or Die and CollegeHumor which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any video ad revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them. This release strategy was considered by The Atlantic as a [...] "web-enabled precision video delivery operation, and evidence of some serious digital <b>distributional</b> forethought" [...] as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site. During an interview on Fox Business, Yankovic explained his method of funding to Stuart Varney, who seemed to misunderstand the possible monetization of Yankovic's videos.|$|E

2500|$|Not only self-published fanzines {{and comic}} books, but most small {{publishing}} companies rely on this <b>distributional</b> form, since the bookstore <b>distributional</b> system's [...] 45-55% share (wholesale company + bookstore or bookstore chain together) {{can be reduced}} {{or in some cases}} even eliminated. Another reason why Hungarian publishers prefer direct sales is that the Hungarian bookshop <b>distributional</b> system is based on commission system, where the publisher is not paid in advance by the distributor, only after the sold pieces, while at an event the publisher receives substantial income immediately. This makes larger direct discounts possible, therefore many fans choose to buy their comics at larger comics events (typically the [...] "börze"-s, festivals). This together leads to a yearly routine, where most companies time their publications to the aforementioned larger events. Comics exclusively distributed through alternative methods put out {{a large portion of the}} overall number of the comic books published. In 2009 this ratio was 15.67%. The ratio of Hungarian comics published through this <b>distributional</b> form is conspicuously high: in 2009 59.6% of the comics in this network were of Hungarian origin, [...] while 68.3% of the Hungarian comics published were only available through alternative distribution. Therefore, this <b>distributional</b> system is regarded as the primary source for domestic comics.|$|E
