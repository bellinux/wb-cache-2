5|$|Through the {{intervention}} of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and {{was seen as an}} ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> old mine outfit for inspection tours.|$|E

It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e. scoutcraft), and here that <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief for the first time.|$|E

500|$|A marble {{portrait}} bust of Bewick {{was commissioned}} from Edward Hodges Baily in 1825 by the Literary and Philosophical Society, {{of which there}} are several copies beside the one still at the Society itself. According to Jenny Uglow, his recent biographer, when he came to sit for the sculptor, he “stoutly refused to be portrayed in a toga. Instead <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> <b>his</b> ordinary coat and waistcoat with neckcloth and ruffled shirt, and even asked for some of his smallpox scars to be shown." [...] Baily was so taken with him that he presented Bewick with a plaster model of the finished bust. A bronze copy now rests in a niche of the building that replaced his workshop in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas (see above) and still another is at the British Museum.
