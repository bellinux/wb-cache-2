50|$|The {{direct method}} of cash flow {{forecasting}} schedules the company's cash receipts and disbursements (R&D). Receipts are primarily {{the collection of}} accounts receivable from recent sales, but also include sales of other assets, proceeds of financing, etc. Disbursements include payroll, payment of accounts payable from recent purchases, dividends and interest on debt. This direct R&D method is best suited to the short-term <b>forecasting</b> <b>horizon</b> of 30 days or so {{because this is the}} period for which actual, as opposed to projected, data is available.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{indirect}} {{approach is}} the accrual reversal method (ARM), {{which is similar to}} the ANI method. But instead of using projected balance sheet accounts, large accruals are reversed and cash effects are calculated based upon statistical distributions and algorithms. This allows the forecasting period to be weekly or even daily. It also eliminates the cumulative errors inherent in the direct, R&D method when it is extended beyond the short-term horizon. But because the ARM allocates both accrual reversals and cash effects to weeks or days, it is more complicated than the ANI or PBS indirect methods. The ARM is best suited to the medium-term <b>forecasting</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

Following Den Haan [2000. The comovement between output and prices. Journal of Monetary Economics 46, 3 - 30], we analyze comovement by computing the correlations of VAR forecast errors of the two variables at different <b>forecast</b> <b>horizons.</b> The empirical correlation is negative and marginally significant for the one-ahead <b>forecast</b> <b>horizon,</b> but the correlations are non-significant for the other <b>forecast</b> <b>horizons</b> studied. In contrast, a simple NKM model under a standard parameterization provides a high and significant negative comovement at all <b>forecast</b> <b>horizons.</b> However, a generalized version including habit formation and a forward-looking Taylor rule is able to mimic the observed weak comovement at medium- and long-term <b>forecast</b> <b>horizons.</b> ...|$|R

Indeed, this problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV or any other meteorological variable {{and on the other hand}} estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource.In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in, which yields to different approaches that can be found in the literature. In this sense, it is useful to classify these techniques depending on the <b>forecasting</b> <b>horizon,</b> so it is possible to distinguish between now-casting (forecasting 3-4 hours ahead), short-term forecasting (up to 7 days ahead) and long-term forecasting (months, years…)Solar radiation closely follows the physical and biological development of the earth. Its spatial and sequential heterogeneity powerfully influence the forcing of environmental and hydrological organisms by manipulating air temperature, soil moisture and vapor transpiration, snow cover and lots of photochemical procedures. Therefore, solar radiation drives place efficiency and plant life allotment, organism a key feature in undeveloped and forestry sciences that be obliged to be known precisely. The quantity of solar radiation obtainable at the earth’ surface is at the outset controlled at worldwide balance, organism above all precious by the Sun Earth geometry and the atmosphere. On the other hand, a complete explanation of its freedom time unpredictability require deliberation of limited procedure which frequently turn out to be also applicable, as is the casing in mountainous region. Predominantly, limited territory adjust the inward bound solar radiation by shadow casts, slope of elevation, surface gradient and compass reading, as a result, precise spatial model of inward bound solar radiation be supposed to regard as the pressure of the terrain surface. In the final time, more than a few events to consist of the confined terrain special effects in the solar radiation countryside have been projected, such as the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), artificial intelligence or post dispensation of satellite stand technique. Solar radiation can be also evaluated using numerical weather forecast (NWP) models. Nevertheless, the space and time balance determined with them and the incomplete computational ability frequently avoid the deliberation of terrain connected property.|$|E

40|$|Forecasts of how {{ecological}} systems respond to environmental change are increasingly important. Sufficiently inaccurate forecasts {{will be of}} little use, however. For example, weather forecasts are for about one week into the future; after that they are too unreliable to be useful (i. e., the <b>forecast</b> <b>horizon</b> is about one week). There is a general absence of knowledge about how {{far into the future}} (or other dimensions, e. g., space, temperature, phylogenetic distance) useful ecological forecasts can be made, in part due to lack of appreciation of the value of ecological <b>forecast</b> <b>horizons.</b> The ecological <b>forecast</b> <b>horizon</b> is the distance into the future (or other dimension) for which useful forecasts can be made.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model is applied to {{simulate}} the rainfall-runoff relation of a karst spring. The input selection for such a model becomes a major issue when deriving a parsimonious and efficient model. The present study is focused on these input selection methods; it begins by proposing two such methods and combines them in a subsequent step. The methods introduced are assessed for both simulation and forecasting purposes. Since rainfall {{is very difficult to}} forecast, especially in the study area, we have chosen a forecasting mode that does not require any rainfall forecast assumptions. This application has been implemented on the Lez karst aquifer, a highly complex basin due to its structure and operating conditions.
