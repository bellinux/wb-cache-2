5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial <b>hepatectomy.</b> Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
25|$|However, {{humans are}} limited in their {{capacity}} for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of liver removed following partial <b>hepatectomy,</b> which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.|$|E

40|$|Background: Centrally located large {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) {{is a difficult}} issue insurgery. These HCCs can be treated by hemi-/extended or central <b>hepatectomies.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the results of hemi-/extendedand central <b>hepatectomies.</b> Methods: One hundred and four patients with centrally-located large tumors were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into group 1 (n = 41) withhemi-/extended <b>hepatectomies,</b> and group 2 (n = 63) with central <b>hepatectomies.</b> Characteristics were analyzed between groups and survival rateswere calculated. Results: Parenchyma resection was limited in group 2. The resection margin in 92. 6 %of group 2 patients was < 1 cm, compared with 78. 9 % of group 1 patients (p= 0. 056). The 1 - and 5 -year disease-free survival rates were 50 % and 38. 9 %for group 1, and 50 % and 15 % for group 2 (p = 0. 279). The 1 -, 5 -year overallsurvival rates were 89. 5 % and 66. 2 % for group 1 and 87. 5 % and 53. 1 % forgroup 2 (p = 0. 786).

Aim: Assessing the immediate postoperative complications {{in a series}} of 88 open liver resections. Method: Prospective database of patients subjected to consecutive <b>hepatectomies</b> over nine years. The post-hepatectomy complications were categorized according to the Clavien-Dindo classification; complications presenting grade equal to or greater than 3 were considered major complications. Hepatic resections involving three or more resected liver segments were considered major <b>hepatectomies.</b> Results: Eighty-four patients were subjected to 88 <b>hepatectomies,</b> mostly were minor liver resections (50 cases, 56. 8 %). Most patients had malignant diseases (63 cases; 71. 6 %). The mean hospitalization time was 10. 9 days (4 - 43). Overall morbidity and mortality rates were 37. 5 % and 6. 8 %, respectively. The two most common immediate general complications were intra-peritoneal collections (12. 5 %) and pleural effusion (12. 5 %). Bleeding, biliary fistula and liver failure were identified in 6. 8 %, 4. 5 % and 1. 1 % of the cases, respectively, among the hepatectomy-specific complications.

40|$|Background/aim: Major <b>hepatectomies</b> {{are widely}} used in curative-intent surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, but {{morbidity}} rates are high. The aim {{of the study is}} to explore potential predictors for clinically relevant complications after major <b>hepatectomies</b> for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: Seventy patients were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for risk factors of morbidities using the International Study Group of Liver Surgery definitions. Results: Severe morbidity rate was 36. 5 %. Clinically relevant posthepatectomy liver failure, bile leak, and hemorrhage rates were 24 %, 22 %, and 8. 5 %, respectively. A neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3. 3 is an independent prognostic factor for severe complications (hazard ratio =  1. 258; 95 % confidence interval 1. 008 – 1. 570; p =  0. 042) while the number of blood units > 3 is an independent prognostic factor for clinically relevant liver failure (hazard ratio =  1. 254; 95 % confidence interval 1. 082 – 1. 452; p =  0. 003). Biliary drainage and portal vein resection were not statistically correlated with any postoperative complication (p ≥ 0. 101). Significantly higher bilirubinemia levels were observed in patients with postoperative hemorrhage (p =  0. 023). Conclusion: Clinically relevant morbidity rates after major <b>hepatectomies</b> for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma are high. Liver failure represents the main complication and is correlated with the number of transfused blood units. A patient with increased bilirubinemia appears to have a high risk for postoperative hemorrhage. Biliary drainage and portal vein resection {{does not appear to have}} a detrimental effect on morbidities. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a novel independent predictor for severe morbidity after major <b>hepatectomies</b> for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and may contribute to better and informed decision-making...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundLiver {{resection}} is {{reputed to}} be one of the most difficult procedures embraced in laparoscopy. This report shows that with adequate training, anatomical liver resection including major <b>hepatectomies</b> can be performed. MethodsThis is a retrospective study. ResultsFrom 1995 to 2004, among 84 laparoscopic liver resections, 46 (54 %) anatomical laparoscopic <b>hepatectomies</b> were performed in our institution by laparoscopy. Nine (20 %) patients had benign disease while 37 (80 %) had malignant lesions. Among those with malignant lesions, 14 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 18 had colorectal metastasis (CRM), while 5 had miscellaneous tumours. For benign disease, minor (two Couinaud's segments or less) and major anatomic <b>hepatectomies</b> were performed in five and four patients, respectively. For malignant lesions, minor and major anatomic <b>hepatectomies</b> were performed in 15 and 22 patients, respectively. Overall, conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 7 (15 %) patients. Blood transfusion was required in five (10 %) patients. One patient died of cerebral infarction 8 days after a massive peroperative haemorrhage. The overall morbidity rate was 34 % whatever the type of resection. Three patients required reoperation, either for haemorrhage (n= 1) and/or biliary leak (n= 2). For CRM (n= 18), overall and disease‐free survival at 24 months (mean follow‐up of 17 months) were 100 % and 56 %, respectively. For HCC (n= 14), overall and disease‐free survival at 36 months (mean follow‐up of 29 months) were 91 % and 65 %, respectively. No port site metastasis occurred in patients with malignancy. ConclusionsAfter a long training with limited liver resection in superficial segments, laparoscopic anatomical minor and major resections are feasible. Short‐term carcinological results seem to be similar to those obtained with laparotomy...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was (1) to compare 2 -dimensional {{computed}} tomographic (2 D-CT) and 3 D-CT computer-assisted preoperative surgical planning, and (2) to define the indications for the latter method. Background: The determination of functional residual liver volumes and the imaging of intrahepatic anatomy are critical when planning complex liver resections. Patients and Methods: Prospective study of 202 consecutive patients who underwent high-risk procedures (extended right/left <b>hepatectomies,</b> central resections, polysegmentectomies, large atypical resections, repeated resections, and <b>hepatectomies</b> in the setting of abnormal liver parenchyma). Preoperative evaluation included 3 D-CT computer-assisted surgical planning (3 D-CASP) and conventional 2 D-CT imaging. Endpoints of the study were (1) determination of resectability and (2) changes in operative strategy (resection modifications/extensions/intrahepatic vascular reconstructions). Results: Thirty-four of 202 cases were considered nonresectable on the basis of both 2 D and 3 D imaging results. In 56 (33 %) instances, 3 D-CASP either changed the 2 D strategy (expansion of resection, n = 40; intrahepatic vascular reconstructions, n = 13) or provided an entirely different approach (n = 3). Eleven (5. 4 %) cases were considered unresectable at laparotomy on the basis of poor liver quality (n = 8) or unfeasible vascular reconstructions resulting in remnants too small to sustain physiologic function (n = 3). Significant differences between resectional 2 D and functional 3 D remnant liver volumes were observed in extended left <b>hepatectomies</b> and left trisectionectomies.
