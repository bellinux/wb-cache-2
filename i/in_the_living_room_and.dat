5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E

25|$|Firefighters were {{immediately}} alerted {{due to a}} natural gas explosion and fire in a Scottsdale house. It ripped through the home in the 2000 block of North 74th Place at 8:42am. It appeared to be centered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent fire burned the house to rubble. The initial explosion {{was strong enough to}} collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for a half-mile (800 m) in all directions. Firefighters kept the -high blaze from spreading to neighboring houses. A series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans, forced them to keep their distance. One suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his balance and fell near the burning house.|$|E
25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

500|$|In the video, Rihanna plays Casta's lesbian love interest. Casta {{arrives at}} the castle in a car, and steps out with a very provocative dominatrix-looking outfit, and meets Rihanna who is waiting inside. Throughout all of the video, Casta tries to seduce Rihanna whilst Rihanna {{initially}} resists, but eventually gives in to Casta's charm. First, she meets Rihanna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> catches her eye. In the next scene, the couple are shown {{on top of a}} table with ultraviolet lighting and Casta rubs her head on Rihanna's legs. They are then shown outside the castle and Rihanna falls to the ground in despair while Casta looks on, letting her long hair fall loose and standing seductively. Soon, they are shown {{in a room full of}} male dancers and Rihanna begins to feel more comfortable around her admirer. The last two scenes are Rihanna and Casta in PVC bondage outfits kissing and caressing on a bed in a darkened room, and then at a burning table, looking away from each other. Billboards music video reviewer, Monica Herrera commented, [...] "Rihanna saved a far sexier clip than 'Rockstar 101' for fans abroad." [...] She described the video's various scenes as [...] "Rihanna getting frisky in a bedroom and setting a fire with a sultry female companion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1929, William Eugene D'Allemund {{built the}} first {{building}} constructed on the property which was to {{become known as the}} Squaw Peak Ranch. It was a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom frame-and-stucco house. D'Allemund used it as a residence. The house featured a flat roof with parapet, a large fireplace constructed of mortared native stone (with the exterior of the front entry also framed in stone), and high ceilings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> two bedrooms.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s {{there were}} also architects who {{did not see the}} world of {{architecture}} in terms of Metabolism. For example, Kazuo Shinohara specialised in small residential projects in which he explored traditional architecture with simple elements in terms of space, abstraction and symbolism. In the Umbrella House (1961) he explored the spatial relationship between the doma (earth-paved internal floor) and the raised tatami floor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> sleeping room. This relationship was explored further with the House with an Earthen floor (1963) where a tamped-down earthen floor was included in the kitchen area. His use of a roof to anchor his design for the House in White (1966) has been compared with Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie Houses. Shinohara explored these abstractions as [...] "Three Styles", which were periods of design that stretched from the early sixties to the mid seventies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this info immediately... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a bridge table <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E

He constantly tattles on his sisters, getting twisted pleasure out of it, as per his remark {{when he had}} stirred the pot to his liking: [...] "This is just like my birthday!" [...] Usually he waits until his sisters already commit an infraction, then he tattles to see his father explode. Rory is his father's favorite, being the boy. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> mentions wanting a monkey, which he once had by trading some of his father's baseball cards; the monkey was later traded for a guitar, which was short-lived, as Rory annoyed the family with it. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget's life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget's underwear drawer. Rory was hit hard by Paul's death and ended up punching {{a hole in his}} wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He covered for it saying he burnt it taking a casserole out of the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the er of the family. However, Rory still had his moments.|$|E
2500|$|About {{one week}} after the game was taken away from Daniel, on October 20, 2007, he used his father’s key to unlock the safe and take it back, also taking his father’s handgun. Court reports stated that Daniel came up behind his parents as they were {{relaxing}} on their couch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> said “Would you close your eyes, I have a surprise for you.” Daniel then proceeded to shoot both of his parents. His father said that “his head went numb and he saw blood pouring down from his skull.” [...] Daniel shot his mother in the head, arms, and chest, killing her. In court his father testified that after Daniel shot both of his parents, he tried to make the event look like a murder-suicide by placing the gun in his father's hand whilst saying to him “Hey dad, here’s your gun. Take it,”. A few minutes later, his sister and her husband, Heidi and Andrew Archer, came over for their prior plans of watching a baseball game together. Daniel lied to them that they should not come in because their parents had been fighting. Then, they heard groaning and pushed their way through to find the aftermath of the shooting. Heidi called the police, and before they got there Daniel made an escape attempt by driving off in the family’s van with the Halo 3 game in the passenger seat. The police caught up with him and forced him out of the van via road block. While police were handcuffing him, he yelled [...] "My Dad shot my Mom!" ...|$|E
