5000|$|On April 25, 2013, The American Spectator, a {{conservative}} news outlet, published a scathing article about Luntz entitled [...] "The Problematic <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz's</b> Stockholm Syndrome".In fact, what Luntz {{has done is}} simply reveal the kind of thinking {{that goes on in}} the minds of too many on the right who, whether they realize it or not, have been intellectually and culturally bullied that there is some sort of 'right way'—'right' as in 'correct'—to think. Resulting in some conservatives who suffer from what might be called a political version of Stockholm Syndrome—where the captives identify with their captors.|$|R

25|$|Trained in the 1970s in Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Richard Bandler (Hartmann is {{licensed}} by Bandler's Society of NLP as both an NLP Practitioner and an NLP Trainer, and Bandler wrote the foreword to his book Healing ADD), Hartmann popularized {{some of its}} concepts in Cracking the Code (2007), which argues that Newt Gingrich and <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> made use {{of them in the}} 1980s and 1990s for Republican Party causes and advocates using them to advance liberalism. His book Healing ADD also leans heavily on NLP techniques. Co-authored with Lamar Waldron, Hartmann's Ultimate Sacrifice released in 2005 states that the Mafia ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA agent and patsy.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, after {{consulting}} focus groups {{with the help}} of pollster <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz,</b> GOPAC distributed a memo with a cover letter signed by Gingrich titled [...] "Language, a Key Mechanism of Control", that encouraged Republicans to [...] "speak like Newt." [...] It contained lists of [...] "contrasting words"—words with negative connotations such as [...] "radical", [...] "sick," [...] and [...] "traitors"—and [...] "optimistic positive governing words" [...] such as [...] "opportunity", [...] "courage", and [...] "principled", that Gingrich recommended for use in describing Democrats and Republicans, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Bayh {{was criticized}} {{throughout}} {{his campaign for}} being [...] "boring" [...] or [...] "dull," [...] but media outlets also described the candidate as [...] "folksy" [...] and displaying a [...] "Midwest charm," [...] that some compared to President Harry Truman. The Washington Post commented that he was [...] "unexciting but very dependable and electable," [...] {{and that he would}} [...] "have a great shot" [...] if the Democratic Party was [...] "feeling pragmatic". The Wall Street Journal lauded the Senator as a [...] "genuinely fiscally conservative Democrat." [...] His record as a governor and Senator were also portrayed as desirable assets. Pollster <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> summed up Bayh's campaign, describing the Senator from the perspective of his audience: ...|$|E
500|$|Former Pat Buchanan pollster <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> {{was hired}} by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee {{chairman}} Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|E
500|$|The second {{presidential debate}} {{was held on}} October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, and {{included}} questions from undecided voters, who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained {{that there was a}} [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 {{million of his own money}} to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> explained, [...] "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pollster <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> {{tested the}} phrase {{with a focus}} group in 2001, and {{concluded}} that the only people who really disliked the epithet were highly partisan Democrats. [...] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed modern use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans. Journalist Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it. Marcus stated that disagreements over use of the term are [...] "trivial", and Hertzberg calls use of the term [...] "a minor irritation" [...] and also [...] "the partisan equivalent of flashing a gang sign".|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee came {{in second}} place in the Family Research Council Value Voters Summit straw poll with 27.15%, behind former Massachusetts Governor Romney, but won among onsite voters with 51.26 percent of onsite votes at the Washington, DC meeting. On October 22, actor Chuck Norris {{announced}} his endorsement of Huckabee in a release on Huckabee's website. Norris said that [...] "I believe {{the only one who has}} all of the characteristics to lead America forward into the future is ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mike Huckabee is the real deal." [...] On The Sean Hannity Show on October 22, debate analyst <b>Frank</b> <b>Luntz</b> said [...] "I think Mike Huckabee's coming in 2nd in Iowa." [...] In late October, following the Republican Presidential Debate in Orlando, Florida, Huckabee's website traffic increased to more than that of all of the other Republican candidates except for Ron Paul. On October 25, a national Rasmussen poll gave Huckabee his highest polling number yet - 10%. Talk show host Bill O'Reilly, who was a skeptic of Huckabee's success, had previously made a bet with Dick Morris that Huckabee would never reach double digits.|$|E
