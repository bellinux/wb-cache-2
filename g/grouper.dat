Diving in Florida's Tampa Bay on leave, Bolt (then a captain) set a world spearfishing record when he caught an Atlantic goliath <b>grouper</b> weighing hundreds of pounds.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as <b>grouper,</b> mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
50|$|As other fish, <b>groupers</b> harbour parasites, {{including}} digeneans, nematodes, cestodes, monogeneans, isopods, and copepods. A {{study conducted}} in New Caledonia {{has shown that}} coral reef-associated <b>groupers</b> have about 10 species of parasites per fish species. Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, monogeneans of the family Diplectanidae are typical of and especially numerous on <b>groupers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus is a genus of monopisthocotylean Monogenean, {{included}} in the family Diplectanidae.The type-species of the genus is Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938).The genus includes more than 80 species, which are all parasitic on the gills of marine fish, especially <b>groupers.</b> Since <b>groupers</b> are mostly abundant in warm waters, species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are found in warm parts of the oceans, especially in coral reefs, but species have also been found in deep-sea <b>groupers.</b> Several species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are pathogens of maricultured <b>groupers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are {{attached}} to the gills of <b>groupers.</b> No information is available on the pathogen effect of these parasites in wild <b>groupers.</b> Since the life-cycle is monoxenous and thus can be completed with a high rate of success in mariculture condition, species of Pseudorhabdosynochus can proliferate on gills of cultured <b>groupers</b> and become dangerous for the fish, inducing mortality.|$|R
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a <b>grouper</b> of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} value, <b>grouper</b> {{have been the}} most {{significant}} component of the reef fishery. The <b>grouper</b> fishery has also come under pressure due to demand from local tourism and international markets. The <b>grouper</b> fishery has been sustainable so far, but there is very little potential for expansion under current practices, and a strict management regime is required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grouper</b> are fish {{belonging}} {{to a number of}} genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae, in the order Perciformes. Species of <b>grouper</b> include the black, comet, gag, giant, Goliath, Nassau, saddletail, tiger, Warsaw, white and yellowfin <b>grouper.</b> Typical lengths are 80â€“120 centimetres. They inhabit depths from reefs near the surface down to over 400 metres. They feed on just about any moving animal they encounter. Groper are important inshore commercial fish, usually caught with gill nets (in earlier times longlines were used).|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} predator of S.latus is the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus, although {{a number of}} other fish species have also been reported to prey on S.latus, including dusky <b>groupers</b> (Epinephelus guaza), combers (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), red <b>groupers</b> (Epinephelus morio) and gag <b>groupers</b> (Mycteroperca microlepis). An Octopus vulgaris has been observed to eat S.latus in an artificial setting, but it is unclear whether S.latus is preyed on by octopuses in nature.|$|R
50|$|Brown-marbled <b>groupers</b> can be cultured by {{hatcheries}} {{but these}} installations are still getting fishes {{straight from the}} wild. This method has also {{a negative effect on}} the global population because all the <b>groupers</b> catch in any size category are kept and grown until they reach market size.|$|R

In 2005 production from the aquaculture sector was 3,725 tonnes valued at HK$120 million which was 2.2 per cent in weight and 6.7 per cent in value of the total fisheries production.

About 990 licensees units are engaged in marine fish culture. Common species cultured include green <b>grouper,</b> brown-spotted <b>grouper,</b> Russell's snapper, mangrove snapper, cobia and pompano.

25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), <b>grouper,</b> Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath <b>grouper,</b> Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, the {{government}} has encouraged the introduction of different marine species, including the large shrimp or prawn Penaeus chinensis, as well as scallop, mussel, sea bream, abalone, <b>grouper</b> and the mud mangrove crab Scylla serrata.|$|E
25|$|Groundfish fisheries: Groundfish, such as snapper, jacks, {{emperors}} and <b>grouper</b> {{are harvested}} from coral and rock habitats, mostly around the Hawaiian Islands.

40|$|Some viral {{infections are}} serious {{diseases}} of <b>groupers</b> causing heavy mortalities. In most cases, larval stages {{are the most}} susceptible stage. With the carnivorous nature of <b>groupers,</b> they can readily ingest viral pathogens from live fish food or trash fish that carry the viral pathogens. Moreover, viruses are able to effect vertical transmission from broodstocks that are likely carriers of the virus. Survivors of viral epizootics can be carriers of viral pathogens.

25|$|Fish species {{found in}} the islands include many species of shark, ray, moray eel, bream, jack, grunt, scorpionfish, triggerfish, <b>grouper,</b> goby, and blenny.
