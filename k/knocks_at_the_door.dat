5|$|In 2007, Sally Sparrow enters Wester Drumlins, an {{abandoned}} house, {{to look for}} subjects to photograph. Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the Weeping Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E
25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, but I do not believe even his faster bumper <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, I consider, lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, of course, is sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E
2500|$|Emilia <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> (Emilia: Aprite! Aprite! / [...] "Open up!") {{announcing that}} Cassio has killed Roderigo. Desdemona softly calls {{out that she}} has been {{unjustly}} accused, but refuses to blame Otello. She dies. Emilia calls Otello a murderer; he retorts that Iago gave him proof of Desdemona's infidelity. Otello begins to threaten Emilia, who calls for help. Iago, Cassio, and Lodovico enter. Emilia demands that Iago deny Otello's accusation; he refuses. Otello says that the handkerchief Desdemona gave to Cassio is proof enough. Emilia, horrified, explains that Iago stole the handkerchief from her—Cassio confirms that the handkerchief appeared mysteriously in his lodgings. Montano enters and says that Roderigo, with his dying breath, has revealed Iago's plot. Iago, brandishing his sword, runs away.|$|E

Charlotte <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Marat's housekeeper asks {{her to come back}} an other time but he demands that she be let in. They remain alone together. Charlotte has brought a list of [...] "enemies of the Revolution" [...] for him to examine. He reads his own name at the top and asks for an explanation. They start an argument about power, loneliness, truth, and death, which ends up with her stabbing him to death. At the instant in which the blade descends upon him Marat understands the meaning of the look in Charlotte's eyes and dies without knowing her name.|$|E

60|$|After which, {{she tugged}} at his coat with both hands, and pulled him all askew in {{buttoning}} that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket, and then tied her dimples into her bonnet-strings in a very knowing way, and took him back to London. Arrived at Mr Boffin's door, she set him with his back against it, tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles for her purpose, and kissed him until he knocked muffled double <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{with the back of}} his head.
