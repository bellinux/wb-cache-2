He made one {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> Division Series (ALDS) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, taking the loss in Game 3 after giving up a game-winning, twelfth-inning single to Erick Aybar. That was Boston's only loss of the series, as they defeated the Angels in four games. He made two appearances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tampa Bay Rays, allowing no runs as the Red Sox were defeated in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing had a 9–14 win-loss {{record with}} a 3.91 ERA in the 1933 season, as the Yankees {{finished}} in second place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL.</b> He threw a one-hitter on June 20, 1934, against the Cleveland Indians. Two weeks later, Joe Cronin selected Ruffing for the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. At that point, he had a 9–3 win-loss record on the season.

5|$|In May 2000, Henderson was {{released}} by the Mets, and quickly {{signed as a free}} agent with the Seattle Mariners. In only his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others, and Omar Vizquel became the fourth in 2010). Despite the late start, Henderson finished fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> in stolen bases (31).|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{committed}} 18 {{errors in}} 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman {{and his staff}} saw Jeter's defense as an area {{that needed to be}} addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The American League (AL) and the National League (NL) alternated picks {{throughout}} the first round; because an NL team drafted {{first in the}} 1986 MLB Draft, an AL team had the first selection in 1987. Having finished 67–95 in 1986, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> and thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.|$|E
5|$|The Naps soon {{regretted the}} trade. With the Yankees, Peckinpaugh {{emerged as a}} team leader. He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance. Chance {{resigned}} with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager {{for the remainder of}} the season; at the age of 23, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He finished the 1914 season fifth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> with 38 stolen bases.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees had {{the best}} record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> at 91–63, {{finishing}} three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and greatly improving on their 69-win, seventh-place 1925 season. Lou Gehrig played his first full season as the Yankees' starting first baseman, and the team traded for rookie shortstop Tony Lazzeri in the offseason, eventually playing him at second base. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Ruth led the offense, while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them.|$|E
40|$|Crystallographic textures of the {{austenitic}} low-density Fe- 30. 5 Mn- 8. 0 Al- 1. 2 C (8 Al) and Fe- 30. 5 Mn- 2. 1 Al- 1. 2 C (2 Al) (wt. %) steels {{were examined}} during cold rolling {{by means of}} electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI). Random oriented grains orient towards Goss- and brass-components along the α-fiber as the strain increased, with activation of slip, mechanical twinning, and shear banding, for both steels. S- and copper-orientations were also observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8 <b>Al</b> steel at 50 % reduction. The route of Cu-CuT-Gossbrass texture evolution was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2 <b>Al</b> alloy. Cu, Goss, and brass textures occur as a dominant texture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deformed 8 <b>Al</b> alloy. Copper-type texture accompanied with slip at low reduction (20 %), as well as Cu-type shear bands, and shear banding inside Goss-oriented grains at higher reduction (50 %), were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8 <b>Al</b> steel. It is suggested that this copper-type rolling texture {{may be attributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> addition, which contributes to its low twinning activity compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2 <b>Al</b> alloy. Cu-CuT-brass f. c. c. rolling texture transition to form the Brass-type texture was observed at higher reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2 <b>Al</b> alloy with strong similarity to that found in other Fe-Mn-C system TWIP steels...|$|R

5|$|Though the Yankees {{continued}} {{to struggle with}} postseason failures, Jeter remained a consistent contributor. During the 2007 season, Jeter was third <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> with 203 hits, his third consecutive season and sixth overall, with at least 200 hits. He also finished ninth in batting average (.322). He was selected for his eighth All-Star appearance. In the field, {{he was involved in}} turning a career-high 104 double plays. He struggled during the 2007 ALDS, batting 3-for-17 (.176) with one RBI, as the Indians defeated the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|After fifth-place {{finishes}} in 1968 and 1969 (the latter {{in the newly}} created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth {{by the end of}} their campaign with a record of 79–76.|$|E
