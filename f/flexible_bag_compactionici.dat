Using multiple actuators for one driving axis {{is one of the}} possible solutions; however, there is an associated problem of output power matching. This study proposes a new active joint mechanism using multiple actuators. Because the actuator is made of a <b>flexible</b> <b>bag,</b> it does not interfere with other actuators when it is depressurized. The proposed joint achieved coordinated motion of multiple actuators. This report also discusses a new actuator which has dual cylindrical structure. The cylinders are composed of <b>flexible</b> <b>bags</b> with different diameters. The joint torque is estimated based on the following factors: empirical formula for the flexible actuator torque, geometric relationship between the joint and the actuator, and the principle of virtual work. The prototype joint mechanism achieves coordinated motion of multiple actuators for one axis. With this motion, small inner actuator contributes high speed motion, whereas large outer actuator generates high torque. The performance of the prototype joint is examined by speed and torque measurements. The joint showed about 30 % efficiency at 2. 0 [*]Nm load torque under 0. 15 [*]MPa air input...|$|R

40|$|A body {{oscillating}} {{in water}} will produce waves. A big {{body and a}} small body may produce equally large waves provided the smaller body oscillates with larger amplitude.

This can be obtained by an oscillating body as explained above. Alternatively, wave generation by oscillatory displacement of water can be obtained, for instance, by an oscillating water column (OWC) in a fixed chamber having an opening into the sea. It is also possible to enclose the water by blocking the chamber opening with an elastic or <b>flexible</b> <b>bag,</b> which can oscillate under wave action.

5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>bag</b> was {{required}} to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a <b>flexible</b> <b>bag</b> is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|R

40|$|The Resin Infusion process (RI, {{also known}} as VARTM) is a {{subclass}} of the Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) collective, which is increasingly applied in industry. As opposed to the other LCM processes, RI utilises only one rigid mould half, the upper mould half of the mould being a <b>flexible</b> plastic <b>bag.</b> This greatly reduces tooling costs, and makes the process suitable for medium to very large sized parts. However, the interaction between a <b>flexible</b> <b>bag</b> and the infusion of the laminate within, presents a significant challenge to model and understand. The University of Auckland LCM research group is developing SimLCM as a generic LCM mould filling simulation. SimLCM has recently been extended to simulate RI, focusing on resin flow and laminate thickness predictions throughout the process. To accurately predict filling times, {{and the evolution of}} fluid pressure and laminate thickness during filling and post-filling phases, a detailed knowledge is required of the complex compaction response of the fibre reinforcement. While significant research has been published on modelling of the filling in RI, the post-filling period has received much less attention. This phase is, however, significant as spatial variations in laminate thickness are removed, preferably before the infused resin gels. Extending on previous work on rectilinear filling, this paper will present a program of RI experiments in a range of 2 D flow geometries and the results will be compared to the predictions made using SimLCM. Special attention is given to the post-filling stage, and the validation of the new models developed for SimLCM.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Resin Infusion under Flexible Tooling (RIFT) is {{a process}} by which resin is infused through the fibres through the {{application}} of a vacuum. Only a one-sided mould is used and the other side is covered with a <b>flexible</b> <b>bag.</b> In the two parts of this thesis a physically based flow model and a genetically based tool are presented to simulate and optimise the RIFT process in advance, both for complex 2 1 / 2 dimensional geometries. The flow model of Part 1 was based on Darcy's law. Due to the <b>flexible</b> <b>bag,</b> the preform compacts during the process and hence the fibre compaction flu term was taken into account and the process was modelled transient. A stabilisation method was developed, using a thickness prediction for a new time step size. Although this prediction was based on a rather crude assumption, it provided a simple and fast way to overcome stability problems. Experiments were carried out to establish and model the different wet and dry compaction behaviour of two types of preform. The different dry and wet preform properties were also taken into account. A fluid presence function was used for flow front tracking and for the pressure prediction in the partially filled cells. The model was implemented for the use of 2 1 / 2 dimensional unstructured meshes. The model was validated with experiments. The compaction of the preform and the flow front propagation during mould filling were measured. It was found that, in the case of highly compactable fibres, the fibre compaction flux term increased the accuracy of the calculated results significantly. The genetically based tool of Part II is capable of optimising the different process parameters such as flow pipe position and length, fill-distance and number of vents. The tool consists of a mesh distance-based model coupled with a genetic optimisation algorithm. The mesh distance-based model was {{based on the assumption that}} the resin fills the nodes closest to the inlets first. The genetic algorithm was based on the principles of natural selection and genetics and its effectiveness was improved with a variable cross-over rate. The mesh distance-based model was verified with cases known from literature und with the results from the physically based flow model. The effectiveness of the genetic algorithm was validated with a number of design cases. For the simple 2 D design cases, the tool provided fast solutions which agreed very well with the obvious solutions. For the more complex cases, the algorithm proved to be a very stable and effective method for finding the optimal flow pipe arrangement on any complex geometry. Doctora...|$|R
