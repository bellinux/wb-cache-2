5000|$|... 1983 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change for Stompers. The core line of 4x4 {{vehicles}} was given a second speed, free-wheeling when the vehicle was off, and wider tires. The Stomper II Authentics featured new graphics and fender flares. The older single-speed Stompers remained, positioned as an economical alternative to the new three-speed Stompers; the single-speeds now had no chrome and decal graphics. New Road Rods were [...] "inspired by souped-up versions of today's most popular customized vehicles." [...] The semis were renamed Road Kings and joined by Heavy Haulers, with wrecker or dump bodies. Wilderness Campers featured <b>interchangeable</b> tonneau <b>covers</b> and camper shells, and could be had with a trailer carrying a boat or motorcycle. A bulldozer and front-end loader joined the Work x4s line, and the amphibious Water Demons and military-themed Mobile Force lines were introduced. most vehicles also included a Stunt Wheel, a fifth wheel that attached to the vehicle's underside and allowed it to be driven on two of its main wheels.The Wild Country playset {{was replaced by the}} Wild Canyon set, while the Badlands Trail and Devil Mountain sets continued. The Stomper Super Cycles continued largely unchanged.1984 saw the introduction of Stomper Super Dragsters, [...] "six supercharged neutron-powered dragsters" [...] claimed to be [...] "the fastest vehicles known to man." [...] The three-wheeled All-Terrain Cycles were also new for 1984. The Wilderness Campers came with a trailer as standard and added a power take-off winch, and were renamed Workhorses. The Water Demons line expanded to six vehicles, and there were also new semi-trucks. Several new playsets were added, for both the Stomper II and Mobile Force lines, and two vehicles were dropped from the Road Rods line; these were repackaged into the Custom Kit and Dekuxe Custom kit, allowing children to build a Stomper themselves.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of pre-compensating images {{in a computer}} display according to the visual aberrations previously assessed in an optical system (e. g., the computer user’s eye) has been confirmed for a simple “artificial eye”. This device has been constructed from optical components, which include a plano-convex lens, an adjustable aperture, and a Charged-Couple Device (CCD) array that mimics the retina of a real eye. While the CCD array allows for the inspection of the image as it would form on the retina of a real eye, its specular reflection does not allow the resulting “artificial eye ” to be measured appropriately in a wavefront analyzer (a necessary pre-requisite for the image precompensation process). Therefore, an alternative, <b>interchangeable</b> CCD array <b>covered</b> with gray paint (i. e., disabled) was also created to provide the diffuse reflectivity that is presumed {{in the operation of}} the wavefront analyzer. Experiments with this system show that the visual aberrations in a properly characterized optical system can, in fact, be precompensated by the methods proposed by Alonso et al., [1]. These same experiments, however, reveal the need to adjust the precompensation method according to the effective pupil diameter in the system during viewing.
