5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} {{reproduction}} of pallid sturgeon was observed, {{since all the}} fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E

5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 1991, Combs {{left his}} law office during a flash flood about 5:30pm.

5|$|The Colorado River had {{experienced}} natural flooding before {{the construction of}} the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker, are listed as endangered.|$|E

5|$|The first ambush was {{conducted}} by two platoons from B Company on 27 May 1965 and resulted in significant Indonesian casualties, for no loss to the Australians. The second ambush {{was conducted}} a fortnight later and was set a little further <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the last one, this time by a platoon from C Company, occurring on 12 June 1965 and again resulting in heavy Indonesian casualties for no loss to the Australians.|$|E
5|$|The next tributaries of Catawissa Creek going {{downstream}} are Dark Run and Little Catawissa Creek. Dark Run {{is close}} to four miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the southwest. Little Catawissa Creek is approximately ten miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the west, {{less than a mile}} <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> Dark Run. Little Catawissa Creek starts near Centralia and passes by Ringtown.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} the docks to Avonmouth, seven miles (11km) <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the city centre, {{relieved}} congestion in the central zone of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour) in the late 20th century.

5|$|Chnodomar {{himself and}} his retinue tried to escape on horseback, hoping to reach some boats {{prepared}} for just such an emergency near the ruined Roman fort of Concordia (Lauterbourg), some 40km <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> Strasbourg. But they were cornered by a Roman cavalry squadron in a wood {{on the bank of}} the Rhine and surrendered. Brought before Julian, whom he begged for mercy, Chnodomar was sent on to the court of Constantius at Milan. Not long afterwards, he died of disease in a camp for barbarian prisoners in Rome.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup and Partners {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Chen {{returned}} from his studies in Nanjing to his village of Dongshigu {{in an effort to}} confront environmental pollution. A paper mill constructed in 1988 had been dumping toxic wastewater into the Meng river, destroying crops and harming wildlife. The chemicals also reportedly caused skin and digestive problems among villagers living <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the mill. Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill. The effort was successful, and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill. In addition, Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing, informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals. The British government responded by providing £15,000 towards a deep water well, irrigation systems and water pipelines.|$|E

5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E
5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to mount an ambush on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the ambush {{was to be a}} little further <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position early the next morning and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} day, a detachment of the Boys under Seth Warner's command went to nearby Fort Crown Point and captured the small garrison there. On May 14, following {{the arrival of}} 100 men recruited by Arnold's captains, {{and the arrival of}} a schooner and some bateaux that had been taken at Skenesboro, Arnold and 50 of his men sailed north to raid Fort St. John, on the Richelieu River <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the lake, where a small British warship was reported by the prisoners to be anchored. Arnold's raid was a success; he seized the sloop HMS Royal George, supplies, and a number of bateaux.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe {{began at}} about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans {{caught up with}} the {{remnants}} of the British Band a few miles <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> the mouth of the Bad Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors. The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the Yukon River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, <b>downstream</b> <b>from</b> its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
