50|$|Induction {{of sleep}} <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>purposes</b> was first tried by Scottish {{psychiatrist}} Neil Macleod {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. He used bromide sleep in a few psychiatric patients, one of whom died. His method was adopted by some other physicians but soon abandoned, perhaps because it was considered too toxic or reckless. In 1915, Giuseppe Epifanio tried barbiturate-induced sleep therapy in a psychiatric clinic in Italy, but his reports made little impact. Electronarcosis was also developed and used for various psychiatric disorders, involving current passed through the brain to induce deep sleep.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a simple}} coding matrix for recording physical illness in a compact form suitable for computerization in research. It allows {{the recording of}} physical illness {{in a number of}} different ways: the particular organ system(s) involved; whether the illness is acute or chronic; the severity of illness; and the severity of interference with daily living. The application of the scheme is shown in a cohort of depressed elderly patients in hospital. Also included were three self-assessment scales of physical illness and an OARS Physical Health Rating. It was concluded that the simplest and most parsimonious approach to assessing global physical illness <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> research <b>purposes</b> on the elderly would be to (a) measure the number of body system affected by acute and chronic physical illness, and (b) ask each patient to assess his/her own physical health by one appropriate question...|$|R
40|$|Aim This study {{aimed to}} assess the extent of {{defensive}} clinical practice by psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in a New Zealand Mental Health Service. Method An anonymous questionnaire survey, addressing perceptions {{of a variety of}} defensive practices, was sent to all psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses working in acute clinical settings in the publically funded mental health service in Dunedin, New Zealand. Results Defensive practice is perceived as widespread in psychiatric settings. In particular, practices such as questioning patients about their safety, admissions to hospital, and delayed discharge from hospital were often perceived as occurring <b>for</b> defensive <b>purposes.</b> <b>Psychiatric</b> nurses were more likely than psychiatrists to perceive such practices as defensive. Conclusion Defensive practice is common in mental health. This is despite New Zealand’s no-fault compensation scheme, and so presumably results from concerns other than the risk of financial liability. There may be particular pressures in menta...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the number of patients secluded over a specified period, provide a profile of patients that are likely to be secluded, and to ascertain the reasons for seclusion. Seclusion in the psychiatric context can be defined as the involuntary confinement of an agitated, unstable person alone in a contained, controlled environment. There are differing views on seclusion and consequently this has presented clinicians with an ethical dilemma. Significant morbidity and mortality have been associated with seclusion. In light of this, alternatives to seclusion have been explored. No data exists in South Africa on rates of seclusion <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>purposes,</b> and consequently neither the need for seclusion nor alternatives to seclusion have been explored. The study is a retrospective review of patients secluded at Sterkfontein Hospital, a tertiary psychiatric hospital, over a six month period. Data was collected from clinical records at Sterkfontein Hospital. RESULTS: 112 patients were secluded over the 6 month period. Users were secluded for a total of 59415. 5 hours and on 4814 separate occasions. 84. 8...|$|E
40|$|Background: In England and Wales over 5000 {{people die}} each year with a sudden death of {{ill-defined}} or unknown cause. Aims: To explore {{the hypothesis that the}} use of drugs that can cause prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiograph are associated with an increased risk of sudden death from cardiac arrhythmia. Methods: A community based, matched case control study used post mortem and primary care datasets. Cause of death was most likely due to cardiac arrhythmia. 789 cases were matched to 2357 controls for age, sex and cardiovascular disease at the GP practices. The International Registry for Drug-Induced Arrhythmias “Arizona” classification was used to separate drugs according to strength of QT prolongation. Results: Conditions significantly associated with sudden death were used in the adjusted analysis. Overall risks were doubled for the registry drugs that were considered to pose the greatest risk but with considerable variation. The association with sudden death increased with concomitant use of registry drugs. Drugs used <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>purposes</b> were consistently strongly associated with sudden death. Conclusion: Arizona registry classification is a poor predictor of sudden death. The linkage of the general practice research database to mortality data has the potential for a much larger sample for further study...|$|E

Patients and methods: Using a large United States commercial claims and encounters database, patients younger than 65 years diagnosed with schizophrenia were identified. Patients initiated on a depot antipsychotic were studied in a mirror-image design to assess change in hospitalization rates, mean duration hospitalized, and hospitalization cost. McNemar&rsquo;s test and paired t-tests compared the proportions of patients hospitalized and the mean duration. Paired t-test and bootstrapping methods compared costs. Results: In these patients (n = 147), psychiatric hospitalizations declined from 49. 7 % pre-initiation to 22. 4 % post-initiation (P &lt; 0. 001), and the mean hospitalized duration <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>purposes</b> numerically declined from 7. 3 to 4. 7 days (P = 0. 05). Total health care costs declined from $ 11, 111 to $ 7884 (P &lt; 0. 05) driven by reduction in costs for psychiatric hospitalizations from $ 5384 to $ 2538 (P &lt; 0. 05). Conclusion: Initiation of depot antipsychotic therapy appeared {{to be associated with}} a decline in hospitalization rates and costs. Current findings suggest that treatment with depot antipsychotics may be a cost-effective option for a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia who are at high risk of nonadherence with their oral antipsychotic medication regimen.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{inadequate}} {{attention to the}} aftercare of psychiatric patients, resulting {{in an increase in}} readmission rates plus longer hospital stays. There is a gap in the aftercare <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> patients; The <b>purpose</b> of this qualitative retrospective study is to explore what may have contributed to readmission <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> patients. The biopsychosocial model was used as the theoretical framework to support the direction of the research. The health belief model and transtheoretical model of change were used to further support for biopsychosocial model. The research questions were created to determine the influences on readmission, psychological well-being, explore the adaptation to aftercare and narrative of aftercare from the caregiver. This study used a content analysis to identify patterns and themes with a total of 10 participants. The data used had been previously collected by the behavioral transition team at Houston Methodist Hospital which consists of case notes, mental health diagnoses, hospital history and reasons for readmission. The findings include reports of psychiatric patients not adhering to their prescribed medication due to its side effects or cost, caregivers feeling overwhelmed, and the importance of psychoeducation. Once adjustments were made to the dosage or a prescription for less expensive medication, adherence improved, regular attendance to therapy sessions occurred, and the increase in the level of frustration from the caregiver. Psychiatric patients can benefit in post-discharge care if there is more focus on the reasons for hospital readmission by developing a treatment plan for the prevention of a relapse. This study may improve patient vulnerability to mental health issues and to assist psychiatric patients in establishing balance in their lives...|$|R

40|$|What {{people need}} to know about the drug {{treatment}} of children PETER R. BREGGIN, M. D. IN THE UNITED STATES, non-medical therapists [...] especially psychologists and counsellors-playa pivotal role in decisions about the appropriateness of prescribing stimulant medication to children. Advocates of stimulant medication frequently try to 'educate ' school mental health professionals to make them more enthusiastic about diagnosing Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and encouraging medication. In North America, a giant social experiment is being carried out. A large proportion of school age children are being given psychoactive medications to control their behaviour. One recent study of several school districts disclosed that 7 per cent of children were being given stimulant drugs by the school itself each day and another found that 10 % of children were receiving stimulants at home and school (Marshall, 2000). Yet another study has shown a three-fold increase in the drugging of preschool toddlers with stimulants (Zito et al. 2000). No official statistics on prescription drug use are kept in the United States, but probably at least 5 - 6 million of 50 million school age children are taking stimulant drugs, while another million at least are taking other drugs as well. In addition to stimulants children are commonly given multiple psychiatric drugs. Often the stimulant drug is the gateway drug to others. After being put on methylphenidate (Ritalin) or amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), the child develops adverse drug reactions that are mistaken for a worsening of the child 's 'mental disorder'. If the child becomes depressed, as commonly occurs on stimulants, an antidepressant is added. If the child becomes manic or psychotic, a mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic drug is added. Often these drugs have not been approved for children by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Sometimes they haven't even been approved <b>for</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>purposes</b> at all '. Drug advocates in North America h ave become fond of observing, 'Your child 's depression has emerged under drug treatment ' or 'fhe medication brought out your child 's underlying bipolar disorder. ' In fact, th e drug...|$|E
