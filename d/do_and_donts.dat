Using concepts and vocabulary from usable security and usability of notations theory, we can explain how the Unix platform provokes vulnerabilities in such programs.

However, historic preservation is much more detailed and confusing than most people realize. This confusion has led to the research of issues and management of historic preservation projects and renovations. One must study all of the rules and regulations to truly understand the meaning of ?historic preservation?. How does a building become important enough to be preserved? What are the qualifications a building must meet to undergo renovations instead of being demolished? After realizing there is not one specific answer to these questions, research has shown that in many cases there are not clear rules per building or project. Each is renovated under different circumstance and is sometimes left up to its own interpretation, whether law abiding or not. After exploring the process of renovating historic buildings <b>and</b> the <b>dos</b> <b>and</b> <b>don?ts</b> of each project, case studies of specific projects have helped gain further understanding and explanation of special preservation situations.

40|$|The 2004 tsunami {{disaster}} in Aceh {{resulted in the}} destruction of man-made environments as well as unimaginable human misery. While natural disaster transformed much of Aceh's morphology of urban space, the rehabilitation and reconstruction process that followed continued transforming the typology of domestic space in Acehnese towns and villages, profoundly affecting Acehnese socio-cultural life and society at large. In particular, a fundamentally new type of housing physically and practically changed social and cultural ways of living in Aceh. This paper examines the transformation of domestic living space that followed from large scale building of new permanent homes in post-tsunami reconstruction projects in Aceh and how new living spaces for private families influenced family cultures, lifestyles, <b>do's</b> <b>and</b> <b>dont's,</b> habits, customs, everyday happenings and practices. The overall study proposes a new type of action for post-disaster housing reconstruction based upon the real housing needs of stricken communities which takes into account non-physical aspects of family practices such as cultural living needs and desires, lifestyles and habits as well as physical aspects of location, typology, size and lay-out design of housing concepts. The approach which recognizes and respects the long-term socio-cultural needs of post-disaster housing recipients and their communities at large, rather than focusing on short term reconstruction goals that disregard socio-cultural practices which are integral to community survival. It is suggested that this approach can be successfully applied in post-disaster situations worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{care reform}} {{proceeds}} differently in Belarus. The country has not followed trends visible {{in most other}} countries. Financing and provision of health care {{is still in the}} hands of the state. Health insurance funds are unknown, private practices are rare and operating outside the system, and power of regional health authorities is limited. Besides, for political reasons the country does not benefit from important international aid programmes. Nevertheless, some change can be observed, particularly in Belarus primary care. A family doctor system is being implemented in rural areas, where the situation of health care is poor. Since 1998 two subsequent Dutch-sponsored bilateral projects have supported this development. This paper provides a state of affair of primary care policy development in Belarus and presents first results from a national survey among primary care doctors. Methods: Based on official documents and experiences from the authors, primary care development in Belarus has been analysed in the light of the role of regional health authorities, educational institutes, and the recently established association of family doctors. The national survey among a random sample of primary care doctors (including newly re-trained family doctors) in three regions of the country has been implemented in Spring 2005. The survey instrument has been used internationally. Results: The <b>do’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>dont’s</b> of health care policy in Belarus will be presented. First, results of the national survey among doctors in primary care will be presented, in particular, on the provision of their clinical tasks and aspects of their workload. Family doctor will be compared to doctors who have not been re-trained; Belarus will be compared with other countries. Conclusions: Health care develops very slowly in Belarus, but the country cannot be considered as the open air museum of the Semasko system. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently Biopharmaceuticals {{are the new}} chemotherapeutical {{agents that}} are called as “Biosimilars” or “follow on protein products” by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the American {{regulatory}} agencies (Food and Drug Administration) respectively. Biosimilars are extremely similar to the reference molecule but not identical, however close their similarities may be. A regulatory framework is therefore in place to assess the application for marketing authorisation of biosimilars. When a biosimilar {{is similar to the}} reference biopharmaceutical in terms of safety, quality, and efficacy, it can be registered. It is important to document data from clinical trials with a view of similar safety and efficacy. If the development time for a generic medicine is around 3 years, a biosimilar takes about 6 - 9 years. Generic medicines need to demonstrate bioequivalence only unlike biosimilars that need to conduct phase I and Phase III clinical trials. In this review, different biosimilars that are already being used successfully in the field on Oncology is discussed. Their similarity, differences and guidelines to be followed before a clinically informed decision to be taken, is discussed. More importantly the regulatory guidelines that are operational in India with a work flow of making a biosimilar with relevant <b>dos</b> <b>and</b> <b>dont’s</b> are discussed. For a large populous country like India, where with improved treatments in all sectors including oncology, our ageing population is increasing. For the health care of this sector, we need more newer, cheaper and effective biosimilars in the market. It becomes therefore important to understand the regulatory guidelines and steps to come up with more biosimilars for the existing population and also more information is mandatory for the practicing clinicians to translate these effectively into clinical practice...|$|R

Entertainment is provided and at about 12am the bride and the groom are escorted to their room to consummate their marriage while the age grade members continues with the merriment till dawn. The two young boys that saw the bride off to her grooms house comes back with aka ewu and some Olu oku (Goat upper limb and chicken laps) this is the most thrilling aspect as a young boy I used to fight with my cousin Onyekwelu over who takes up this duty of seeing our sisters off. This is because we are lavishly treated that you never wish to come back home.There is also an important ritual usually performed when the new bride enters a man's house for the first time, it is called ivili akwo (moulden of clay stove). It is symbolic because the grooms family gets a virtuous woman married to the grooms family who is adjudged to be of an exemplary wife, a role model to come and perform this task. This WO!an takes the new bride in and reveals to her the secret of marital success, tells her of the <b>dos</b> <b>and</b> <b>donts</b> of marriage as it affects the family. The bride is expected to see this woman as her role model and confidant. This akwo symbolizes the place of the bride in the family, every married woman in Anam must have an akwo hence the saying that our family is [...] "Akwo ito" [...] meaning that the family has three mothers married to one man. When the woman dies another ritual is performed it is known as ire akwo (breaking of the akwo) this is performed by a daughter in law who related very well with the woman while alive and has found favor in her.|$|R
