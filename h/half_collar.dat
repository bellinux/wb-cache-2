6000|$|... "One day a calf that we had, died. That night I broke its bones, dumped it into {{a coarse}} sack and tied it up with wire.

50|$|Members of the Consular Service wore a {{slightly}} different form of the uniform, with silver embroidery rather than gold predominating. The coatee (for both full-dress and levée dress) was in blue cloth, with a Prussian collar, single-breasted buttoning with nine frosted gilt buttons of royal arms, two more buttons on back waist, two more on coat tails. Consuls-general and consuls had embroidered gold and silver lace on collar, cuffs, pocket flaps, and back. Consuls-general had 2+1/2 in, consuls 2 in. Vice-consuls 1+1/2 in on cuffs, and front <b>half</b> of <b>collar</b> only. All wore white breeches and stockings, patent leather court shoes with gilt buckles for full dress, or trousers with silver lace stripes and patent leather military boots for levée dress. Consuls' stripes were 2+1/4 in, others' were 1+3/4 in. These were worn with black beaver cocked hats, black cockade, silver bullion loops, and gold tassels. For consuls-general there were treble loops and a border of black ostrich feathers, for consuls double loops, and for vice-consuls single loops. A blue greatcoat or cloak, blue detachable cape was for outdoors use. The sword accessories {{were the same as}} for standard court uniform.|$|R
6000|$|She had {{no place}} to go this holiday afternoon, and she longed to join a noisy, excited party. Of Walter Babson she did not think. She stubbornly {{determined}} to snatch this time of freedom. Why, of course, she asserted, she could play by herself quite happily! With a spurious gaiety she patted her small black hand-bag. She skipped across to the Sixth Avenue Elevated and went up to the department-store district. She made elaborate plans for the great adventure of shopping. Bessie Kraker had insisted, with the nonchalant shrillness of eighteen, that Una [...] "had ought to wear more color"; and Una had found, in the fashion section of a woman's magazine, the suggestion for exactly the thing--"a modest, attractive frock of brown, with smart touches of orange"--and economical. She had the dress planned--ribbon-belt half brown and <b>half</b> orange, a <b>collar</b> edged with orange, cuffs slashed with it.|$|R
