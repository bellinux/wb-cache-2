To <b>guard</b> against treatment <b>optimism</b> and continued risky sexual practices which might result from improved health status, ART clients are also subjected to intensive behavioural change intervention campaigns in Uganda. However, comprehensive evaluation of behavioural change interventions /programmes {{and the impact of}} ART on sexual behaviour in Uganda is scarce and limited to only six months duration on ART. This thesis investigated ART clients' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and ART, patterns of VCT services use prior to ART initiation, sexual practices before and after ART initiation. The extent to which ART clients adapt to HIV/AIDS preventive measures and the appropriateness of the health education model were also investigated. A cross sectional study was conducted between June-September 2008 among Villa-Maria hospital clients in Masaka district Uganda. A purposive convenient sampling technique was applied to select a total of 48 participants. Data was collected using interviewer administered questionnaire, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. A total of 48 questionnaires were administered, 16 in-depth interviews and 4 focus group discussions with 32 participants were conducted. Study participants were evenly distributed across the sexes. The majority were subsistence farmers and had been on ART for almost two years on average. Their educational level was predominantly upper primary. The mean distance covered to the ART /VCT centre was 18 km. The findings indicate high levels of knowledge about both HIV/AIDS and ART except for a few individual cases. The study shows that ART initiation had improved the health of the clients and had enabled them to start getting involved in economic activities although at a lower rate than prior to their HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Although no participant reported being a victim to stigmatisation, routine home visits were criticised for working as a trigger for stigmatisation and HIV infection suspicion. Participants reported increased food appetite as a consequence of ART treatment, and occurrence of ART side effects was reported to be due to none observance of ART rules. Reduced frequency of sexual intercourse and reduced number of sexual partners were also reported after diagnosis and ART initiation. Condom use was reported to be inconsistent because it was disliked by the male clients, the desire to have children, financial dependency and being in a stable marital union. VCT uptake followed long episodes of persistent illnesses and it was influenced by relatives, friends, health care workers, HIV/AIDS diagnosis was confirmed at the first VCT visit for all clients. The study showed that there is an emerging phenomenon of ART self discontinuation among the newly born again Christians. Although ART treatment benefits stretched beyond its clinical benefits, complete recovery of ART clients' economic status prior to their HIV/AIDS diagnosis was still a big challenge to interviewees. Sexually active ART clients don't use condoms consistently and correctly despite their reported reduction in frequency of sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners and high knowledge levels about HIV/AIDS and ART.

40|$|The recent {{recurrent}} droughts {{and famine}} {{in parts of}} Africa have revived iriterest in an ancient technology, that of water harvesting. This system of water conservation, involving the collection and storage of run-off from infrequent storms and flash floods, {{is known to have}} supported a flourishing agriculture in the Negev Desert more than 5, 000 years ago. Modern experimental systems suggest there is considerable scope for extending the traditional schemes still in limited use in arid areas {{all over the world to}} this day. Aerial photographs and careful fieldwork have allowed researchers to piece together and, in some cases, reconstruct the ancient water harvesting systems of the Negev Desert. The simplest system involved the building of low stone walls across the dry desert valleys, or wadis. In this way a series of terraces was formed, so that during the occasional flash floods water was retained for long enough behind each wall to allow it to soak into the terrace soil. This infrequent soaking provided a sufficient reserve of water in the root zone for a variety of crops to be grown. In larger valleys,. where torrential floodwater would have destroyed the terrace walls, a dam was built part of the way across the valley to divert some of the stormwater onto the adjoining terraced fields. In small tributary valleys, elaborate systems of stone barriers and channels were used to check sheet runoff from the hills surrounding the farmsteads and direct it onto the terraced fields below. Complex systems of gates and stone steps, or spillways, between terraces allowed the farmer considerable control over how much water each terraced plot received Trapping water and silt Although the ancient systems of the Negev Desert are the best known and most researched examples of water harvesting, similar systems are known to have existed in arid areas elsewhere. There is evidence that the Mexican Indians created garden plots by building loose rock dams across gullies and valleys more than 1, 000 years ago. These not only trapped water but silt as well so that over a period of time a deep and fertile alluvial soil accumulated behind each stone barrier. The North American Indians in Arizona and Colorado were also familiar with water harvesting techniques over 500 years ago. The ancient Persians dug pits in gently sloping land to trap water for their crops, and water harvesting techniques have a long tradition in many other parts of the Middle East and in parts of North Africa such as Algeria and Tunisia as well. Limited use is still made of traditional water harvesting methods in many areas to this day. The Bedouin exploit the ancient terraced wadis in the Negev by sowing a crop of barley as the floodwaters retreat. A similarly opportunistic form of water harvesting is practised in north-west Kenya, where sorghum is grown in naturally occurring depress~ons where the rain water collects. In Sudan, high retaining walls are built on the gentle slopes to the east of the Nile to hold back floodwater for long enough to saturate the soil and allow a quick maturing crop such as millet to be grown as the soil water recedes. Floodwater from the mounts in North and South Yemen is diverted and trapped in ponds made by building up high earth banks, and similar methods of water harvesting are to be found in India and Pakistan. Impervious surfaces The two features common to all water harvesting systems, whether ancient, traditional or modern, are the catchment area and the storage area, or reservoir. Ideally the surface of the catchment area should be impervious to water to allow maximum run-off to occur. In some cases such catchments occur naturally, but in others the catchment surface is treated to improve run-off or an artificial surface mav be used. Granite or sandstone rock outcrops, and soils such as the loess of the Negev Desert which crust over as soon as rain falls, need little modification, although clearing rubble, filling cracks and removing vegetation can all help improve run-off. In less favourable situations run-off can be increased by smoothing and compacting the soil surface. An example is the roaded catchment system, widely used to collect water for livestock in Western Australia. Here road construction equipment is used to compact and camber the soil surface, to form a series of parallel roads measuring between 5 and 12 m from crest to crest, on a stretch of sloping ground between 50 and 300 m long. Storm water collects in the furrows between the roads and flows into a channel at the lower end of the catchment, from where it is led into a reservoir. Soil surfaces which have been compacted for other reasons, such as roads, airstrips and school playgrounds, can sometimes be exploited to provide run-off water for crops or livestock. Careful design and regular maintenance is necessary to avoid soil erosion with compacted catchments, although in some systems the washing down of soil can be beneficial by filling up small depressions in the catchment surface and building up soil fertility in the area where the crop is grown. Chemical treatment has also been used to improve surface run-off mainly in experimental systems. In Arizona, clay soils have been treated with sodium salts; these cause the clay particles to disperse so blocking the pores in between. Treatment with water repellents such as paraffin and silicon wax has also been tried. Surface sprays of asphalt have been tested on the sand dunes of Rajasthan in India and the Sahara in Libya and might be a feasible option for wealthy countries with oil. Other examples of high tech water harvesting have been tried in Arizona, Utah and Hawaii, where butyl rubber sheeting has been used to line both the catchment and the reservoir to provide water for livestock or domestic purposes. Although there have been problems as the rubber deteriorates and as a result of rodent damage, these schemes have generally been succesful Run-off water once collected has to be stored. In most of the traditional systems described, where the water is used for growing crops, the storage area is the soil itself. Deep water-retentive soils are therefore ideal. But if the soil is very freedraining, evaporative losses are high, run-off is excessive or if the water is to be used for cattle or domestic purposes, then a surface reservoir is needed for storage. Such reservoirs may range from simple pits dug in the ground, sealed by puddling with clay, to more substantial tanks and cisterns. Water losses as a result of evaporation can be reduced by covering the surface of the reservoir with materials such as wax, polystyrene or foamed rubber sheeting. Ensuring minimum yields At the Desert Runoff Farm Unit in the Negev Desert, some of the ancient run-off farming systems have been carefully re-created and now serve as experimental farms. Here, where the scanty and unpredictable rainfall is less than 200 mm a year, a tremendous range of crops has been successfully grown using harvested water alone. These include grasses and cereals (such as wheat, barley, sorghum and millet), legumes (lentils, chickpeas and novel varieties of beans), grape vines, soft fruit (logan berries and fruit, nut and fuelwood trees plums, apricots, peaches, pomegranates, cherries apples, figs, olives, carobs, pistachios, Acacia, Prosopis, Leucaena and Eucalyptus). In good years yields are comparable with crops grown in irrigated conditions but even in drought years there is usually some yield. Cereals, almonds, pistachios and olives do particularly well. Annual crops which are quick maturing (such as millet) or deep rooting (such as sorghum) and perennials which can tolerate both drought and occasional inundation are those which do best. Dr Pedro Berliner, head of the Desert Farms Research Unit, says 'We believe this type of agriculture can help solve some of the more urgent needs of the sub-Saharan belt and other similarly drought-stricken parts of the world'. Others are more <b>guarded</b> in their <b>optimism.</b> Kutsch, a German researcher who has identified a number of areas in Africa likely to be suitable for run-off farming, points out that only in northern Africa, where rain occurs in the cooler winter months. are conditions directly comparable with those in the Negev Desert. In the dry areas of tropical Africa, where temperatures are higher and any rain usually falls in the hot summer months, rapid water loss from the crop and the soil may mean that only schemes where the annual rainfall exceeds 300 mm will succeed. Mathematical models which take account of weather data and soil conditions can now help in the selection of areas suitable for rainwater harvesting and in the design of appropriate systems. But where few records exist site selection is likely to depend, as in the past, on local knowledge and intuition, with schemes being modified or abandoned in the light of experience. Farmers in the Turkana District of northern Kenya use the growth of native plants to guide their choice of suitable sites. The dwarf shrub Duosperma indicates a deep loamy soil, whereas a particular Acacia indicates a site liable to waterlogging. For pasture improvement, semi-circular barriers of earth or stone can be constructed at intervals down sloping land. Grass seed is then broadcast and as rainwater washes over the surface, both water and seed collect behind each barrier allowing clumps of grass to establish which then soon spread. To be successful, new schemes need to take account not only of physical conditions but of local social and cultural traditions as well. For example nomadic people such as the Turkana may be reluctant to be tied to one area in order to keep elaborate systems maintained. However existing schemes show that water harvesting can do much to improve conditions in drought stricken areas. They not only provide people with water but also help control the soil erosion which occurs during sudden heavy storms. Harvesting relies only on local water and systems can be constructed using locally available materials and skills. Micro-catchments are particularly simple to lay out and maintain. In relatively wet areas water harvesting can allow crops to be planted or provide extra water for small irrigation schemes. In arid areas it can allow other sources of water to be reserved for emergencies, and so make the difference between life and death. The recent recurrent droughts and famine in parts of Africa have revived iriterest in an ancient technology, that of water harvesting. This system of water conservation, involving the collection and storage of run-off from infrequent storms and [...] ...|$|R

In her fascinating paper for this Symposium, Professor Litman expresses a <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> that in its forthcoming decision in MGM v. Grokster, I the Court will retain the staple article of commerce doctrine that it first articulated in Sony. She opines, however, that the user privacy strand of the Sony decision is a lost cause. I don 2 ̆ 7 t believe that it 2 ̆ 7 s possible to retain the staple article of commerce doctrine while abandoning user privacy. At least in the realm of networked digital technologies, the two concepts are inextricably linked. To explain why, I {{would like to}} begin by examining a concept that I 2 ̆ 7 ll call copyright 2 ̆ 7 s public-private distinction. This distinction does not concern {{the presence or absence of}} state action, but rather the presence or absence of conduct triggering legal accountability...|$|E

Although there is considerable controversy about this trend, it seems inevitable thatmultimodal treatments including psychopharmacological interventionswill need to be better under-stood and integrated if we are to provide effective treatment to the largest range of patients. In this article, we offer some observations from our clinical experience regarding the effects of medications on the alliance, transfer-ence, and family system. In particular, we examine some of the complex psychodynamic meanings of medication that can dramatically affect re-sponse to both medication and psychotherapy.

40|$|The native {{status of}} the {{southern}} right whale in Peruvian waters is now firmly supported by six confirmed sightings, including four cow-calf pairs, the northernmost at Pucusana (12 ° 29 ’S, 76 ° 48 ’W) and off San Bartolo (12 ° 24 ’S, 77 ° 11 ’W). An unconfirmed report exist from northern Peru. Five of six observations were shore-based, underscoring the importance of neritic habitat for E. australis also in Pacific South America. As sighting intervals have shortened {{over a period of}} two decades (near significant trend, P= 0. 054) without indication of improved reporting, a <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> for the recovery of E. australis in Peru may be warranted. However, a near-collision event with a fishing boat warns of conservation challenges ahead. As applies to three other cetacean species, the coast of Peru is proposed as the most boreal habitual range for E. australis on the planet, enabled by the cooling effects of the strongest of eastern boundary currents...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) has {{traditionally}} been an important economic partner for Asia. In addition to absorbing a significant share of the region's exports, the EU {{has been a major}} source of foreign direct investment and other capital flows into the region. In light of such close economic linkages between the EU and Asia, the euro crisis will undoubtedly influence Asia's short-term macroeconomic outlook. The key question, however, is how big the impact will be. This paper tries to answer this by examining both the trade and financial channels of crisis transmission. The impact on developing Asia will fall primarily on trade but there are also significant effects on the region's financial systems, especially its banking sector. However, overall, the magnitude of the shock from the euro crisis will be significantly smaller than the shock from the global crisis. A further cause for <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> is that developing Asia still has relatively ample policy space to cushion a major external shock...|$|E
40|$|Subjective {{well-being}} (SWB) {{is a major}} {{topic of}} research across the social sciences. Twin and family {{studies have found that}} genetic factors may account for as much as 30 - 40 % of the variance in SWB. Here, we study genetic contributions to SWB in a pooled sample of ~ 11, 500 unrelated, comprehensively-genotyped Swedish and Dutch individuals. We apply a recently-developed method to estimate “common narrow heritability”: the fraction of variance in SWB that {{can be explained by the}} cumulative additive effects of genetic polymorphisms that are common in the population. Our estimates are 5 - 10 % for single-question survey measures of SWB, and 12 - 18 % after correction for measurement error in the SWB measures. Our results suggest <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> about the prospects of using genetic data in SWB research because, while the common narrow heritability is not large, the polymorphisms that contribute to it could feasibly be discovered with a sufficiently large sample of individuals...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{availability}} of networked personal computers within organizations has en-abled new methods for organizational research involving presentation of research stimuli using Web pages and browsers. The authors provide {{an overview of}} the technological challenges for collecting organizational data through this medium as a springboard to discuss the validity of such research and its ethical implica-tions. A review of research comparing Web browser–based research with other ad-ministration modalities appears to warrant <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> about the validity of these new methods. The complexity of the technology and researchers ’ relative un-familiarity with it have created a number of pitfalls that must be avoided to ensure ethical treatment of research participants. The authors highlight the need for an online research participants ’ bill of rights and other structures to ensure success-ful and appropriate use of this promising new research medium.

40|$|In his {{reflection}} {{on the future of}} globalization, the last essay of the book, Bryan Turner draws attention not only to some of the positive trends such as juridical glo-balization but also the threats of war, pandemics and ecological ruination. On balance, the negatives outweigh the positive. A better way of ending this review will be to underscore the fact that the global financial meltdown is on the road to recovery, US President Obama has taken steps to withdraw US troops from Iraq and a conversation on the global environment is resuming. Yet the space for optimism is overshadowed by the dark clouds of global warming, threats of war and a continuation of interethnic violence and terror attacks which force us to a position of <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism.</b> Alongside Robertson and White’s (eds), Globalization: Critical Concepts in Sociology (6 volumes) and Robertson and Scholte’s (eds) Encyclopedia of Globalization (3 volumes), this compendium is a welcome addition to the literature.

40|$|Spanish economists facing {{indicative}} {{planning in}} the 1960 S - In this paper, {{the history of}} the adoption of the French indicative planning in Spain will be examined. Specific attention is given to the ideas of Higinio Paris {{at the end of the}} 1940 s and to the ideas of Manuel de Torres in the 1950 s, as well as to institutions like the Consejo de Economía Nacional or to the development of the first input-output tables and the first national accounts. Second, the support that the new instrument of economic policy in Spain had at the beginning of the 1960 s will be analyzed, including the effective rhetoric that helped to implement it. Lastly, the <b>guarded</b> <b>optimism</b> with which Spanish economists from that time greeted the I Development Plan is shown, a plan which suffered for an increasingly disapproving attitude from the middle of the 1960 s. Displaying a notable capacity of analysis, Spanish economists were able to anticipate a large part of the critical arguments that are today employed by economic historians in light of the development planning.
