5|$|Yet {{the poem}} does leave one {{wondering}} what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> between Gawain and Lord Bertilak had Gawain been {{seduced by the}} Lady.|$|E
5|$|However, {{further studies}} of the visible and near {{infrared}} spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice, together {{with no more than}} 8% organics. The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> more than 100 million years ago, in agreement with the dynamic studies.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat back}} and screwed her eyes tight, as she had always done when puzzled. Something <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> to her, but how it <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> and when it <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> and why it <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> she could not understand. She only knew that {{now for the first}} time she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly.|$|R

6000|$|... 'What do you mean? What <b>has</b> <b>happened?</b> Something <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to you. What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at home? What are {{you going}} to do?' she said sharply. She palpitated with terror. For the first time she felt powerless. Siegmund was beyond her grasp. She was afraid of him. He had shaken away her hold over him.|$|R
5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration of what might <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Maddy {{died after}} being stabbed by {{disturbed}} patient Chantelle Tanner. After the attack, a full episode misled viewers by showing what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if Maddy had been saved, before revealing {{at the end}} that Maddy had actually died.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kona Lanes was a {{repeated}} topic at political events. One Costa Mesa city council candidate said {{he made a}} commitment to public service when the building was torn down with little resistance. Another would-be council member agreed that the demolition should never <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that that could not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, Edward II, Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, {{who claimed to have}} reached the Mediterranean.|$|E
6000|$|Morley trembled; {{and then}} in a hurried and {{agitated}} voice, said, [...] "No, no, no; nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> Much may <b>happen,</b> but nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> And we may prevent it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Hook Court?" [...] Miss Demolines {{threw herself}} back into an arm-chair, closed her eyes, and clasped both her hands upon her forehead. [...] "What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Hook Court?" [...] said Johnny, {{walking up to}} her.|$|R
5000|$|The Raiders {{became the}} first team since North Queensland in Rounds 13 and 14 2007 to concede 50+ points in {{consecutive}} games, {{it was also the}} 2nd time in Raiders History this <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>having</b> <b>happened</b> in Rounds 2 and 3 2006.|$|R
5|$|Later, {{when they}} gather to congratulate {{the bride and}} groom, the friends joke {{that they should be}} able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
5|$|Many of the locations, characters, {{and events}} in Dynasty Warriors 4 are {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in Chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make the game more appealing to the player. There are also some features that are historically inaccurate. The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era. Common items throughout the game include Fairy Wine and Dim Sum’s.|$|E
5|$|No {{player has}} taken {{multiple}} hat-tricks in international women's cricket, and similarly no venue has hosted {{more than one}} hat-trick. English, Pakistani and New Zealand bowlers have taken more hat-tricks than any other nations; three bowlers from each nation have achieved the feat. Nine hat-tricks have been taken in ODIs, while all six of the hat-tricks in T20I matches <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> since the most recent instance in women's Tests.|$|E

6000|$|... "If it be {{anything}} that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> at Mowbray, {{especially in this}} quarter, I should think I had. Times must be very bad indeed that some one does not drop in to tell me anything that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> and to ask my advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{interesting}} to know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to the world. [...] . This green vapor--queer stuff. But I know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to me. It's Conversion. I've always known. [...] . But this is being a fool. Talk! I'm going to stop it." ...|$|R
5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and could well <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus {{said of the}} Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.|$|E
5|$|The company started {{producing}} {{bus chassis}} in 1950, and the superstructures were {{built by a}} number of Finnish coach builders. The last models were appreciated {{by a number of}} bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in Finland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Andor {{came into}} the tap-room. With soft words and insinuating {{promises}} he got me {{to tell him what}} <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> I didn't want to at first--I mistrusted him because of what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> at the banquet--I knew that he hated me because of you." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{disgusted by}} his behavior, Elinor agrees {{to pretend that}} nothing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> {{to the rest of}} the family.

5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons. Most importantly, an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring. The full floods could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it was unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> {{before the end of the}} Balkans Campaign.|$|E
5|$|While still a three-year-old, he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, something that would not <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
