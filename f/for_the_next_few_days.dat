5|$|During the four-day offense of Vahan, {{his troops}} {{had failed to}} achieve any {{breakthrough}} and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

5|$|The American forces {{reported}} 57 killed, 37 wounded, 17 {{missing and}} 6 captured, {{for a total}} of 117 casualties from the 19th and 29th Infantry Regiments. This number was far lighter than casualties for other unit actions of similar size so far in the war. North Korean casualties are unknown but believed to be far heavier than the American force. Actions in the Notch, as well as attacks on the region <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> are known to have largely destroyed the North Korean 6th Division, and over 50 percent of its force became casualties in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico. This was an abnormally late start to an Atlantic hurricane season: only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11. The storm moved slowly in a generally westward direction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It then weakened until it made landfall along the northern Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur as a tropical depression, where it caused only minor damage. Near 0600 UTC on September 16, the storm deteriorated into a depression, and dissipated a few hours later.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical disturbance near {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 20. Two days later, the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of Cape Verde. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity. It is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 26, about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Initially, the storm was elongated, although beginning on August 28 it began to intensify more quickly. That night, the storm attained hurricane status, and many nearby ships reported gale force winds.|$|E

He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture {{into the woods and}} swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew {{most of his}} {{men from}} Badajoz, leaving behind a 7,000-strong garrison. The field army's 9,000 {{infantry}} settled on the heights of San Cristóbal while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the Caya. The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington's plan, failing to dig entrenchments on the heights, nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements. Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz. Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers, rendering them impassable, so that between 11–18 February the French were only able to shell {{the southern end of}} the Spanish line, pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.|$|E
5|$|Saomai, {{the second}} strongest typhoon {{in the western}} Pacific in 2000, {{developed}} from an area of disturbed weather in open sea on August31. The system was initially quick to intensify, reaching an initial peak intensity as a typhoon on September4. Wind shear caused a hiatus in Saomai's strengthening phase, {{and as a result}} Saomai weakened back to a tropical storm as it tracked northwest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> On September9, the system regained typhoon intensity and began to rapidly intensify, reaching peak intensity on September10 with maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). Over the ensuing two days Saomai would weaken slightly before making landfall on Okinawa Island. The typhoon later entered the East China Sea, where it recurved towards the northeast before making landfall on South Korea as a severe tropical storm, later transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September16. Saomai's remnants would move into Russia before dissipating three days later.|$|E

5|$|Washington and {{the other}} ships of TF39 participated in {{exercises}} with the Home Fleet until late April. Along with certain British units, the task force departed the British Isles as TF99. They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union. While carrying out this duty, an accompanying British battleship, , accidentally rammed a destroyer, cutting it in two. Directly behind King George V, Washington passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges. Though damage to the hull was minimal—limited to only one leaking fuel tank—many devices on board the ship were damaged, including main battery range finders, circuit breakers, three fire-control and the search radars. The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port, Hvalfjörður, until 15 May; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. On 4 June, Washington hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> On 7 June, King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship.|$|E

25|$|This {{legend has}} been {{interpreted}} to be a mythological conflation of a seasonal and astronomical event: The heliacal rising of Sirius (with which Tishtrya is associated) occurred in July, just before the hottest and driest time of the year. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Sirius is visible at dawn as a flimmering star (doing battle with Apaosha). In the torrid summer months, as Sirius becomes more directly visible, {{the light of the}} star appears to grow stronger (Tishtrya gathering strength) until it is steadily visible in the firmament (Apaosha vanquished). With the defeat of Apaosha, the rainy season begins (in late autumn).|$|E
25|$|Paxton {{was visiting}} London in his {{capacity}} as a director of the Midland Railway to meet the chairman John Ellis who was also a member of parliament. He happened to mention an idea he had for the hall, and Ellis promptly encouraged to produce some plans, provided they could be ready in nine days. Unfortunately he was committed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> but at a board meeting of the railway in Derby, it is said he appeared to be spending much of his time doodling on a sheet of blotting paper. At the end of the meeting he held up his first sketch of the Crystal Palace, inspired by the Victoria Regia House. The sketch is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

On 20 May, she shifted to Kutaka Shima, and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, San Francisco provided fire support for the 77th Infantry Division, and retired to Kerama Retto the next day.

25|$|On 30 July 1808 Meleager, {{under the}} command of Captain Frederick Warren, had been sailing from Port Royal, Jamaica, when in the evening the master, believing that land in sight was Portland Point, set a course that would take her well clear of land. Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; {{although}} the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem in the inflow of water were unsuccessful. During the night the crew took down the masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, NASCAR lifted Busch's {{indefinite}} suspension after {{prosecutors in}} Delaware determined {{there was not}} enough evidence to bring a criminal case against Busch, making him eligible to compete again, starting with the CampingWorld.com 500 at Phoenix. Driscoll is now under federal indictment for fraud and misusing charitable donations for personal gain. Additionally, Busch was granted a waiver by NASCAR, making him still eligible for the Chase if he won a race between then and the autumn Richmond event. In his first race back from suspension, Busch finished fifth. At Auto Club, Busch won the pole and led the most laps (65), before being bumped back to third due to a last lap pass by Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. The race ended in controversy as, according to an online poll, 69% of the fans suspected a fix in the waning laps on NASCAR's part. NASCAR denied the allegations but not before controversy broke out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> following the race.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} to {{make it all the way}} to the NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too much pain to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN is one of the many websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E
