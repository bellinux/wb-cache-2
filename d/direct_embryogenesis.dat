40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is an {{in vitro}} morphogenetic route in which isolated cells {{or a small}} group of somatic cells give rise to bipolar structures resembling zygotic embryos. Lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins are major compounds in plant and animal metabolism. Comparative analysis along different developmental stages of Acca sellowiana (Myrtaceae) zygotic and somatic embryos, revealed a progressive increase in levels of total lipids. A high degree of similarity could be found in the total lipids composition between A. sellowiana somatic and zygotic embryos. High lipid levels were found in zygotic embryos in the torpedo and cotyledonary stages, and these levels increased according to the progression in the developmental stages. Somatic embryos obtained through <b>direct</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> route showed higher levels of lipids than in indirect somatic embryogenesis.

40|$|Haploidy/doubled haploidy {{methodology}} {{is commonly}} used in many agronomically important crops to speed {{the development of new}} cultivars. There are a number of advantages in using haploidy technology in both practical application (varietal development, mutagenesis, transformation) and basic research (genomics, biochemical, and physiological studies). Haploid plants are commonly produced using one of four methods: culture of anthers or microspores (androgenesis), culture of unfertilized ovules (gynogenesis), interspecific or intergeneric crosses followed by chromosome elimination, and by pollination with irradiated pollen. The most efficient method depends on the species. In many species, the culture of isolated microspores or anthers is the most frequently used method of haploid production. With this method, every microspore is potentially capable of regenerating into a viable embryo and each plant would therefore represent the variation which exists in the population of microspores. Plant regeneration occurs either by <b>direct</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> or through callus formation followed by embryogenesis or organogenesis. There are a number of factors influencing embryogenesis from anther/microspores or ovaries/ovules including genotype, donor plant growth conditions, stage of explant development, composition of the culture medium, and environmental conditions during culture. The frequency of embryo production will depend on whether or not these conditions are optimal and varies depending on the species. Compared to some agronomic species, there has been very little work on doubled haploidy in ornamental species despite the potential benefits. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

The frequency of these karyological changes varied with the type of somatic embryos with regard to morphological abnormalities. Normal and abnormal rooted somatic seedlings were able to grow until production of the first leaf and then entered dormancy {{in the same manner as}} zygotic plantlets...|$|E
40|$|The {{process by}} which a single {{totipotent}} cell becomes a complex organism is a unidirectional program, with each mitotic division generating new cells that gradually differentiate towards more specified fates and specialized functions. Nuclear transfer (NT) experiments have demonstrated the epigenetic nature of development and showed, that although differentiated cells have a very limited developmental potential, the nuclei of these cells retain the potency to <b>direct</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> after reintroduction into the unfertilized oocyte. Herein, we have used the mouse as a model system for understanding both the nature of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs after NT {{as well as the}} ramifications it has for the development of cloned animals. Specifically, we investigated how epigenetic states are reprogrammed after NT and demonstrated that the inactive X chromosome is reactivated in NT embryos, resulting in normal X inactivation in female clones. Additionally, investigations into the factors that influence the survival of cloned animals, indicate that there are considerable genetic influences on the cloning process. These genetic factors modify the survival of mice cloned from ES cells by influencing the developmental potential of the donor ES cells rather then the reprogramming process itself. This realization has subsequently {{led to the development of}} novel methods for the expedited production of complex mutant mice, which are also described. Finally, we have created cloned embryos by NT from both cortical and mature olfactory sensory neurons to address question of nuclear equivalence in the brain and to investigate whether generation of synaptic diversity or odorant receptor choice, are mediated by genetic as well as epigenetic events. by Kevin C.

40|$|Protea cynaroides L. (King Protea) is a {{well known}} cutflower. Seeds and stem {{cuttings}} are commonly used to propagate P. cynaroides. However, the success rate and rooting rate of seeds and cuttings, are inconsistent and slow. The potential of in vitro propagation as an alternative method to produce P. cynaroides plantlets was investigated. In vitro studies consisted of in vitro germination of mature zygotic embryos, micrografting and <b>direct</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> of zygotic embryos and excised cotyledons. In the germination study, temperature {{was the most important}} factor in obtaining a high germination percentage. Alternating temperatures of 21 ± 2 ºC/ 12 ± 2 ºC (light/dark) was suitable for germination and over 90 % of embryos germinated, while the germination percentage of embryos at 25 ± 2 ºC was poor. Plantlets were successfully established in ex vitro conditions when planted in a peat/coir/sand mixture. Micrografting of P. cynaroides was done by grafting microshoots (microscion), which was taken from in-vitro-established nodal explants, onto roots of decapitated in-vitro-germinated seedlings. After the graft union formed, buds on the microscion sprouted. A protocol to induce <b>direct</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> was developed. <b>Direct</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> was achieved on both P. cynaroides mature zygotic embryos and excised cotyledons. The addition of auxins such as NAA and 2, 4 -D singly or in combination with TDZ, BAP or kinetin suppressed the formation of somatic embryos. Formation of somatic embryos was observed in medium lacking growth regulators. Germination of somatic embryos was highest in medium containing GA 3. The roles of starch and phenolic compounds in the rooting of P. cynaroides cuttings were also studied. Starch and total soluble phenol analyses results revealed a positive correlation between high root formation and increased starch and phenolic content. NMR and MS analyses identified high amounts of 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in stems of P. cynaroides. In vitro bioassay showed that 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid stimulated and inhibited root growth of P. cynaroides explants, depending on the concentration. A link was made between the endogenous concentration levels of 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and rooting of P. cynaroides stem cuttings. Findings of this study contribute towards a better understanding of the roles starch and phenolic compounds play in the rooting of P. cynaroides.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a simple}} and efficient system of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) regeneration through <b>direct</b> somatic <b>embryogenesis</b> by using immature embryonic shoot tips (IEST) as explants. The cultivar Kaohsiung 10 (cv. K 10) {{used in this study}} did not show embryogenic response either from mature seed-derived explants (cotyledon, embryonic tip, leaf, shoot and root) or immature cotyledons. However, it showed a high percentage (55. 8 %) of somatic embryo (SEm) formation from the IEST excised 2 - 3 wk after flowering, thus indicating the crucial roles of type and age of explants. The IEST put forth primary SEm after 2 mo of culturing on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6 % sucrose, 164. 8 A mu M 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), 5 mM asparagine and 684 A mu M glutamine. Subsequently, secondary SEm were developed 1 mo after culturing on MS medium containing 123. 6 A mu M 2, 4 -D and 3 % sucrose. Cotyledonary embryos were induced on MS medium supplemented with 0. 5 % activated charcoal after 1 mo. The embryos were desiccated for 72 - 96 h on sterile Petri dishes and regenerated on hormone-free MS medium. Plantlets with well-developed shoots and roots were obtained within 5 - 6 mo of culturing of IEST. The SEm-derived plants were morphologically normal and fertile. Various parameters thought to be responsible for efficient regeneration of soybean through somatic embryogenesis are discussed.

40|$|Embryogenesis is a {{morphogenic process}} {{which leads to}} the {{production}} of a bipolar structure containing a root-shoot axis with a closed independent vascular system - the embryo. Three types of embryogenesis are considered based on the plant material from which the embryo derives: zygotic (zygote), somatic (somatic tissues) and gametic (microspores and ovules). Somatic and gametic embryogenesis to be considered as "true-to-type" should mimic the embryonic developmental stages of zygotic embryogenesis. Although real suspensor-like cells are often not present in somatic embryogenesis, the similarity between zygotic and somatic embryogenesis is remarkable from the globular to the early cotyledon stages. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro, in callus, cell suspension cultures, and protoplast cultures (indirect embryogenesis), or directly from cells of organized structures such as leaves or zygotic embryos (<b>direct</b> <b>embryogenesis).</b> As an approach for plantlet regeneration, somatic embryogenesis has several advantages over organogenesis providing useful systems to obtain large-scale clonal propagation and artificial seeds, and for clonal propagation of transgenic plants. For these reasons, the control of plant regeneration by somatic is, at present, one of the major goals of agrobiotechnology. The lack of knowledge of the factors controlling somatic embryogenesis, the asynchrony of somatic embryo development, and low true-to-type embryonic efficiency, are responsible for its reduced commercial application and, they simultaneously, have been the driving force of the fundamental research studies performed in the last decades. Although some basic knowledge of the process of somatic embryogenesis in dicotyledonous species has been achieved through the Daucus carota experimental model system, knowledge of the factors responsible for inducing the process and the meaning of embryogenic competence is still lacking. The complexity of the process and the lack of a good experimental model system are frequently suggested as being responsible for the lack of progress achieved [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|More than 50 {{viruses and}} {{mycoplasma}} {{are known to}} infect cereals. Sugarcane alone is affected by at least five major virus diseases, mosaic, streak, sereh, Fiji, and ratoon stunting. High susceptibility of sugarcane to mosaic virus causes huge loss (30 - 40 %) in net productivity of this crop in Pakistan. Novel biological techniques like tissue culture offer tremendous prospects {{in the field of}} agricultural research. The present study deals with the application of in vitro methods for sugarcane improvement. In vitro techniques ware successfully utilised for the efficient regeneration of sugarcane mosaic virus free stock through apical meristem, organogenesis and embryogenesis in one of the locally cultivated mosaic virus susceptible variety Col- 54. Amongst the leaves, apical meristem and pith, the leaves proved to be the best explant source for callus induction and subsequent regeneration. The optimum temperature for callus induction and multiplication was worked out to be 28 ± 1 oC for all explants. A significant increase in callus induction and proliferation was noticed in dark incubated cultures than the cultures grown in light. Among the auxins, 2, 4 -D was most effective for callus formation. The optimum callus formation occurred at 3 mg/l 2, 4 -D. Addition of cytokinin alone or in combination with auxin did not cause any promotive effect. Two prominent callus types, white compact and friable developed from the cultured explants which exhibited different morphogenic response. In vitro regeneration from sugarcane callus was obtained via organogenesis and embryogenesis. Shoot and differentiation through organogenesis was obtained both under hormone-free and kinetin-mediated media. Shoot induction was also dependent on incubation period both for hormone-free and hormone-mediated conditions. Organogenic callus developed numerous meristemoids and bud primordial which subsequently differentiated into plantlet s. Vigorous rooting of plantlets was induced on MS basal medium. Somatic embryogenesis was induced in all explants either directly or indirectly via intervening callus. Direct embryos appeared after 8 - 10 days of incubation on MS basal medium with 1. 5 - 2. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -D. Initially transparent proembryoids. appeared which transformed into globular proembryoids. These ultimately developed into the plantlets. <b>Direct</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> was exclusively dependent on 2, 4 - 0 concentration and incubation period. Highest frequency of regeneration was observed at 1. 5 - 2. 0 mg/l 2, 4 - 0 after 4 week of incubation. Some of the explants incubated for embryogenesis also initiated callus formation. This callus was composed of embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissues. Maximum embryogenic callus induction and proliferation was observed at 3. 0 mg/l 2, 4 - 0. Highest response of embryo germination was noticed at 16 weeks. No positive effect of kinetin or kinetin-auxin interaction was observed on embryogenesis. Along with organogenesis and embryogenesis micropropagation of sugarcane apical meristem was also carried out. Apical meristem was found not only a viable and an efficient source of clonal propagation but also a rapid and reliable mode of virus elimination. In present study, highest number of virus-free plants were obtained by apical meristem culture. Of the three medium M 1, M 2, M 3, used for apical meristem culture, M 3 showed highest propensity for regeneration, as well as, multiple shoot formation. Regeneration capability and success of virus elimination was highly dependent on the Size of cultured SCMV indexation of in vitro regenerated plants was done by infectivity assay, serology test and by transmission electron microscopy. In vitro grown plants, indexed negative by infectivity assay also showed negative results in precipitin test and electron microscopy. Another important aspect of virus-free stock is that these are useful experimental material for studying the effect of specific viruses on host plants. More importantly a biochemical comparison of infected clones with healthy stock could generate outstanding pool of information. In present study, biochemical investigation was undertaken to find out the qualitative and qualitative changes in total phenols, phenolic enzymes, soluble proteins esterases and acid phosphatases both in rejuvenated healthy and SCMV infected plants. The activity of total phenols and phenolic enzyme was found much higher in diseased plants compared with the healthy ones. Contrary to the above findings, soluble proteins and acid phosphatases content were found to be higher in the leaves of healthy plants in comparison with infected ones. The electrophoretic patterns of peroxidase, soluble proteins and acid phosphatases also reflected conformity with the total activities of the molecules. From the present study rapid clonal propagation of sugarcane was achieved through apical meristem, organogenesis and embryogenesis. Degree of success for eliminating virus in cultured tissues appeared very high. Although meristem was an excellent source for virus elimination but reasonable success was also found in embryogenic and organogenic plants. In vitro grown healthy plants were further used as an experimental material to investigate the effect of virus infection on host plants in comparison with healthy ones. A clear cut biochemical alterations were recorded in virus-infected stock which confirmed the physiological and metabolic interference of virus particles on host plants...|$|E
40|$|Blue-flowered Conospermum are {{endemic to}} Western Australia, and show great {{potential}} as cut flowers. Propagation from cuttings or seed proved difficult, and root initiation in vitro is problematic. This thesis examines the floral biology {{of the species}} {{and the possibility of}} using somatic embryogenesis to overcome propagation problems. A survey of explant tissue types for C. eatoniae and C. caeruleum was carried out to identify tissue that could be induced into embryogenic pathways. Vegetative, semi-floral and floral buds were initiated into culture from February to June, but were found unsuitable for embryogenesis, producing shoots, callus or dying in culture. Leaves from in vitro leaf cultures formed callus in the presence of 2, 4 -D and BAP, but were unable to differentiate into embryos {{in the presence of a}} variety of growth regulator combinations and concentrations. Immature zygotes died in culture. <b>Direct</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> and/or embryogenic callus was observed on mature zygotes of the species C. caeruleum, C. spectabile, C. dorrienii and C. brownii, and somatic embryos were maintained in culture for up to 18 months for C. caeruleum. Maturation and germination of somatic embryos proved difficult; treatments of cold, ABA, desiccation or mannitol did not induce maturation. It appears that developmental pathways in Conospermum are well defined and are difficult to alter in vitro. It was concluded that somatic embryogenesis has limited commercial potential in these species. Conospermum species have an active pollination mechanism where the style is held in a state of tension when the flower opens. When pressure is applied at the base of the style by an insect, the style flicks downwards, striking the insect pollinator and releasing pollen from the anther in a single dusty mass. However, the breeding systems of blue-flowered Conospermum have not previously been well explored. Flowers on a C. eatoniae inflorescence opened from the basal end upwards acropetally, with the terminal two or three buds never opening. Fruit and seed set occurred only from the basal one to three buds. Isolation of C. eatoniae and C. amoenum flowers showed they were unable to self-pollinate in the absence of insect pollinators. Experiments to determine the timing of the peak of stigmatic receptiveness were inconclusive. Pollen germinated and penetrated the stigma 0 - 6 days after anther dehiscence. Pollen loads on the stigma did not relate to the number of pollen tubes observed down the style. Controlled pollinations of cultivated C. eatoniae at a field station using self and cross pollen, revealed compatibility with a range of pollen genotypes, as pollen tubes were observed extending down the style. However, late-acting incompatibility could not be ruled out as controlled crosses failed to set any seed as flowers were shed from the bush. DNA analysis of open pollinated C. eatoniae seed progeny from two plants from a field station and two plants in natural bushland revealed very different pollination habits. Plants from the field station showed no outcrossing, with progeny closely resembling the maternal parent, whereas plants from the wild population showed outcrossing with several different paternal parents. These results suggest self-pollinated seed can be reliably obtained in a plantation situation using stands of ramets of the same clone. Alternatively, assuming that the required insect pollinators are present in a cultivated stand, it should be possible to obtain cross pollinated seed by surrounding the maternal plant with the desired paternal parent. Unusual pollen behaviour was observed for many blue-flowered species, a white-flowered species of Conospermum, and close relative, Synaphea petiolaris. Up to three pollen tubes emerged from the triporate pollen in vitro, and at rates of up to 55 mcgms- 1. This rate was maintained for only 2 s but is greater than 20 times faster than reported in the literature for any species, in vitro or in vivo. Pollen with multiple tubes was also observed on the stigma in vivo in C. amoenum flowers. Changing the osmotic pressure of the germination medium by altering sucrose concentration influenced the number of tubes to emerge from the pollen grain; generally the number of tubes decreased as sucrose increased. However, the rate of tube growth was unaffected. The addition of calcium channel blockers to the germination medium had no effect on Conospermum growth rate, nor did they eliminate pulses of tube growth. Observation of Conospermum pollen ultrastructure revealed similarities to Gramineae pollen. The tube cytoplasm was packed with vesicles filled with material of similar electron density to the cell wall. Few golgi were identified, and the apical end of the tube contained these vesicles, smaller secretory vesicles and mitochondria. This is atypical of the tip, which is normally free of large vesicles. Distinct zones in the cytoplasm were not identified, which is similar to Gramineae. Like the grasses, Conospermum appears to pre-manufacture cell wall material and store it in vesicles ready for rapid germination and extension. A biological function of multiple pollen tube emergence with such rapid growth was not elucidated. This research has shown Conospermum to be a complex and very interesting genus. Further investigation into the remarkable growth of multiple pollen tubes would enhance our knowledge of the biological processes involved in tube growth and the process of fast wall formation. The potential benefits to the cut flower industry of commercialising some of these species warrants further effort to find an efficient method of propagation. Introduction into horticulture may be the only means by which these threatened species will survive...|$|E
