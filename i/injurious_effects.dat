In barrier-reefs, therefore, the breaches kept open by draining the tidal waters of the lagoon-channel, will generally be placed on the leeward side, and they will still face the mouths of the larger streams, although removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh water;--and this, it has been shown, is commonly the case.|$|E

60|$|I have {{described}} in my paper 'On the Illegitimate Unions of Dimorphic and Trimorphic Plants' this remarkable variety, which {{was sent to}} me from Edinburgh by Mr. J. Scott. It possessed a pistil proper to the long-styled form, and stamens proper to the short-styled form; so that it had lost the heterostyled or dimorphic character common {{to most of the}} species of the genus, and may be compared with an hermaphrodite form of a bisexual animal. Consequently the pollen and stigma of the same flower are adapted for complete mutual fertilisation, instead of its being necessary that pollen should be brought from one form to another, as in the common cowslip. From the stigma and anthers standing nearly on the same level, the flowers are perfectly self-fertile when insects are excluded. Owing to the fortunate existence of this variety, it is possible to fertilise its flowers in a legitimate manner with their own pollen, and to cross other flowers in a legitimate manner with pollen from another variety or fresh stock. Thus the offspring from both unions can be compared quite fairly, free from any doubt from the <b>injurious</b> <b>effects</b> of an illegitimate union.|$|E

How does nature protect the skunk itself from the <b>injurious</b> <b>effects</b> of its potent fluid? I have not unfrequently found individuals stone-blind, sometimes moving so briskly about that the blindness must have been of long standing--very possibly in some cases an accidental drop discharged by the animal itself has caused the loss of sight. When coming to close quarters with a skunk, by covering up the face, one's clothes only are ruined. But this is not all one has to fear from an encounter; the worst is that effluvium, after which crushed garlic is lavender, which tortures the olfactory nerves, and appears to pervade the whole system like a pestilent ether, nauseating one until sea-sickness seems almost a pleasant sensation in comparison.|$|E
60|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume, is that cross-fertilisation is generally beneficial, and self-fertilisation injurious. This is shown by the difference in height, weight, constitutional vigour, and fertility of the offspring from crossed and self-fertilised flowers, and in the number of seeds produced by the parent-plants. With respect to the second of these two propositions, namely, that self-fertilisation is generally injurious, we have abundant evidence. The structure of the flowers in such plants as Lobelia ramosa, Digitalis purpurea, etc., renders the aid of insects almost indispensable for their fertilisation; and bearing in mind the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over that from the same individual, such plants will almost certainly have been crossed during many or all previous generations. So it must be, owing merely to the prepotency of foreign pollen, with cabbages and various other plants, the varieties of which almost invariably intercross when grown together. The same inference may be drawn still more surely with respect to those plants, such as Reseda and Eschscholtzia, which are sterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that from any other individual. These several plants must therefore have been crossed during a long series of previous generations, and the artificial crosses in my experiments cannot have increased the vigour of the offspring beyond that of their progenitors. Therefore the difference between the self-fertilised and crossed plants raised by me cannot be attributed to the superiority of the crossed, but to the inferiority of the self-fertilised seedlings, due to the <b>injurious</b> <b>effects</b> of self-fertilisation.|$|E

60|$|The crossed plants always {{withstood}} the <b>injurious</b> <b>effects</b> {{of being}} suddenly removed {{into the open}} air after having been kept in the greenhouse better than did the self-fertilised. On several occasions they also resisted much better cold and intemperate weather. This was manifestly the case with some crossed and self-fertilised plants of Ipomoea, which were suddenly moved from the hothouse to the coldest part of a cool greenhouse. The offspring of plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation of Mimulus crossed by a fresh stock, survived a frost which killed every single self-fertilised and intercrossed plant of the same old stock. Nearly the same result followed with some crossed and self-fertilised plants of Viola tricolor. Even {{the tips of the}} shoots of the crossed plants of Sarothamnus scoparius were not touched by a very severe winter; whereas all the self-fertilised plants were killed halfway down to the ground, so that they were not able to flower during the next summer. Young crossed seedlings of Nicotiana withstood a cold and wet summer much better than the self-fertilised seedlings. I have met with only one exception to the rule of crossed plants being hardier than the self-fertilised: three long rows of Eschscholtzia plants, consisting of crossed seedlings from a fresh stock, of intercrossed seedlings of the same stock, and of self-fertilised ones, were left unprotected during a severe winter, and all perished except two of the self-fertilised. But this case is not so anomalous as it at first appears, for it should be remembered that the self-fertilised plants of Eschscholtzia always grow taller and are heavier than the crossed; the whole benefit of a cross with this species being confined to increased fertility.|$|E
6000|$|Feb. 2.--In {{consequence}} of a communication from Lord Lansdowne, I [...] went {{to him in the}} forenoon and found him just returned from [...] Windsor.

60|$|From {{the facts}} now given we may feel nearly sure that {{individuals}} {{of the same}} variety or of different varieties, if growing near each other and in flower at the same time, would intercross; but I cannot myself advance any direct evidence of such an occurrence, as only a single variety is commonly cultivated in England. I have, however, received an account from the Reverend W.A. Leighton, that plants raised by him from ordinary seed produced seeds differing in an extraordinary manner in colour and shape, leading {{to the belief that}} their parents must have been crossed. In France M. Fermond more than once planted close together varieties which ordinarily come true and which bear differently coloured flowers and seeds; and the offspring thus raised varied so greatly that there could hardly be a doubt that they had intercrossed. (5/7. 'FÃ©condation chez les VÃ©gÃ©taux' 1859 pages 34-40. He adds that M. Villiers has described a spontaneous hybrid, which he calls Phaseolus coccineus hybridus, in the 'Annales de la Soc. R. de Horticulture' June 1844.) On the other hand, Professor H. Hoffman does not believe in the natural crossing of the varieties; for although seedlings raised from two varieties growing close together produced plants which yielded seeds of a mixed character, he found that this likewise occurred with plants separated by a space of from 40 to 150 paces from any other variety; he therefore attributes the mixed character of the seed to spontaneous variability. (5/8. 'Bestimmung des Werthes von Species und Varietat' 1869 pages 47-72.) But the above distance would be very far from sufficient to prevent intercrossing: cabbages have been known to cross at several times this distance; and the careful Gartner gives many instances of plants growing at from 600 to 800 yards apart fertilising one another. (5/9. 'Kenntnis der Befruchtung' 1844 pages 573, 577.) Professor Hoffman even maintains that the flowers of the kidney-bean are specially adapted for self-fertilisation. He enclosed several flowers in bags; and as the buds often dropped off, he attributes the partial sterility of these flowers to the <b>injurious</b> <b>effects</b> of the bags, and not to the exclusion of insects. But the only safe method of experimenting is to cover up a whole plant, which then never suffers.|$|E
