40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to the study of <b>ecopedological</b> indexes in different coenosis - steppe; agrocoenosis - arable field, autumn wheat, single-crop corn system (60 years), fallow soil (60 and 100 years), its modification estimated under different anthropogenic influences and agricultural management level and founding of diagnostic indexes in complex evaluation of anthropogenic impact. It was established that soil degradation impact is directly dependent on the level of agricultural management; the studied coenosis soils are significantly modified under anthropogenic impact, and the coenosis near old villages are strongly degraded. The physical degradations (structure modification, bulk density, adherence) prevail. The adherence can be used as diagnostic ecopedologial index for the appreciation of anthropogenic impact level on agro-ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{took place}} in a vineyard ecosystem from Bujoru’s Hills. <b>Ecopedological</b> conditions are favorable for viticulture, especially for red varieties. The soil is a cambic chernozem with degradation trends. The experiment followed the dynamics of macroelements and microelements under the influence of mineral and organic fertilization as well as {{under the influence of the}} mechanical and biological maintenance of the soil during two important phenophases: flourishment and fructification. The parallel analysis of the soil and the plant is the most effective way to determine the nutritional regime of the vine. They allow us to interfere directly in order to optimize nutritional regime so as to achieve maximum efficiency and high quality. The data obtained in the context of the Bujoru ecosystem revealed the existence of the soil-plant-production relations which are useful in developing a coordinated system of fertilization and the maintenance of an ecological design...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{an area of}} erosion soils {{developed}} in Timis county of North - East of Timisoara. Soil erosion phenomenon intensity over the field of Ianova area is controlled by environment factors: relief, climate (rainfall intensity and runoff), vegetation, lithological substratum and human activity. Slope erosion state on erosion classes show {{that more than half}} of slope lands are affected by moderate and strong erosion. <b>Ecopedological</b> indicators of chemical soil characterization present lower values while erosion degree progresses. Thus, humus cantity progressively comes down from soil weak eroded (3, 90 - 2, 82 %) to soil excessive eroded (1, 14 %- 1, 11 %). Nitrogen content expressed through nitrogen indicator has medium values (1, 86 - 3, 04) for weak and moderate eroded soils and small values (0, 96 - 0, 21) for excessive eroded soils. Potassium content substantially comes down from weak eroded soils (180 ppm) till to those excessive eroded (132 ppm). Phosphorus content has small values for all eroded soils (4, 70 - 2, 68 ppm). For eroded fields of Ianova area we propose: antierosional developments, agropedoimprovement works, antierosional agrotechnical works...|$|E
40|$|The present work, {{carried out}} in the frame of the MEDCOASTLAND project, {{constitutes}} a contribution to the knowledge of Mediterranean soil resources and of the opportunities for their conservation and valorisation, as well as the related degradation threats. The study focuses on Sardinia (Italy) and touches two different but linked aspects: the recent developments of the regional soil cartography, based on the new European technical guidelines, and the soil consumption due to urbanisation in some areas of the island characterised by different economic development processes. The first aspect constitutes an example of recovery and valorisation of existing pedological information in view of systematising the available knowledge and providing support to soil conservation planning. The second refers to soil loss by urbanization, qhich {{is one of the most}} important causes of irreversible land degradation, especially in coastal areas. The authors considered a total area of about 210. 000 ha. where soil consumption was estimated both as total areas and as losses of agricultural land capacity. The results show that the relevant soil loss observed is not caused by a rise in resident population, but is driver by the strong tourism and residential development. Both the <b>Ecopedological</b> Map and the study on soil consumption have been conducted by the NRD...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{characteristics}} can exert {{an influence}} {{on the development of}} root systems, mineral nutrition, providing the required heat treatment and conduct aerohidric main physiological processes, and plants (phytocoenosis, in turn, act both directly and indirectly on the state of soil fertility). In the soil conditions can be defined certain characteristics that may be conducive to land productivity and other properties derived from the first. Attributes such as size and composition of soil, humus content are crucial features, while cationic exchange capacity is determined by the first two and by the mineralogical nature of clay. Similarly, available water capacity can be considered as determined by soil texture and structure. Our research concerns an area of 141, 249 ha. (72721 ha. in Timis county and 68, 528 ha in Arad county), belonging to areas located in Vinga Plain and its connection to the low plains or Lipova hills. The research of <b>ecopedological</b> conditions, data ordering and processing was done according to the Methodology of pedological studies elaboration; (vol I, II, III), developed by ICPA Bucharest in 1987 and the Romanian System of Soil Taxonomy (SRTS- 2003). In assessing of land pretability for culture systems are considered soil factors who determine the degree of suitability, soil texture and soil moisture excess. Pretability estimation can be based on the information contained in existing soil studies in the area but also in the field research conducted on soils representative of a particular physical and geographical space...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of the cultural vocation {{is one of the}} most effective means for quality and typicality protection of the productions and, at the same time, to limit soil degradation. In particular, the study of &ldquo;terroir&rdquo;, i. e. the relationships between environment and product quality, highlights a local positivity of the resources, strongly linked to the specificity of origin environments. It must be fairly protect. The valorisation of terroir is mostly considered one of the greatest prospects of success for national agriculture within global market, because very often the quality crops become also reference crops and driving imaging for a territory. Actually the term &ldquo;total quality of territory&rdquo; is very useful; it means the territory managed in function of crops quality, soil and ecosystem conservation, environment healthiness and landscape beauty. The reconnaissance of the territory vocation needs the {{research of}} its peculiarities witch determine the uniqueness of that production area. Therefore the uniqueness of a terroir is a value added to the quality and it may be determining for the success of a cultivation. The &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; technique started from the introduction of terroir concept. It is the division of a territory in function of its <b>ecopedological</b> and geographic characteristics and checking the qualitative result of different species and varieties. In short, the climatic, pedological and crop information interact with productivity and quality of crops. Through the zoning, the constituents of terroir and the verificatio...|$|E
40|$|The studied area {{is placed}} in North-East Jebel locality. Based on the {{physical}} and chemical characteristics and soil morphology profile, the following types of soil were identified: typical preluvosol, typical and gleyic eutricambosols, luvic solonet, gleysol, gleyic vertisol and gleyic-stagnic vertisol. The assessment of land quality (fertility) was determined by bonitation. For the notes of bonitation calculation, the following <b>ecopedological</b> indicatories have been used: annual medium temperature, annual medium precipitations, depth of the underground water, texture in Ap horizon, gleization, pseudogleization, salinization, edafic volume, porosity, soil reaction (pH), humus reserve and content of CaCO 3. The way that these indicators influence the notes of bonitation is different from a type of soil to another {{and the use of}} land. Thus, for grassland, typical preluvosol, the note of bonitate is 81 and it’s included in class II of quality (favorability), luvic solonet with 63 points in class IV of quality, typical eutricambosols with 58 points and vertisol with 57 points, in class V of quality, gleysol with 32 points and gleyic eutricambosol with 36 points, in class VII of quality. In case of using the land for growing maize, we have the following: typical preluvosol with 90 points which is in class II of quality, typical eutricambosol with 54 points and gleyic vertisol with 60 points, in class V of quality, luvic solonet with 49 points in class VI of quality, gleyic-stagnic vertisol with 35 points, in class VII of quality, gleysol with 24 points and gleyic eutricambosol with 29 points, in class VIII of quality. The notes of bonitation calculation, including them in the favorability classes, showed up that lands from Jebel area are good and very good quality, exception those that develop on gleysol and gleyic eutricambosols soils...|$|E
