50|$|However, because {{standard}} definition {{digital video}} was originally based on digitally sampling analog television, the 720 horizontal pixels actually capture a slightly wider image to avoid {{loss of the}} original analog picture. In actual images, these extra pixels are often partly or entirely black, as only the center 704 horizontal pixels carry actual 4:3 or 16:9 image. Hence, the actual pixel aspect ratio for PAL video {{is a little different}} from that given by the formula, specifically 12:11 for PAL and 10:11 for NTSC. For consistency, the same <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> aspect ratios are used even for standard definition digital video originated in digital form rather than converted from analog.

5000|$|... j, l and k are indices for {{contributing}} pixels {{whereas i}} is the index {{for the current}} position. All other values and indices are used as before. The major difference in the comparison of this equation with the equation for the auto-cumulants is {{the appearance of a}} weighting-factor [...] This weighting-factor (also termed distance-factor) is PSF-shaped and depends on the distance of the cross-correlated pixels in a sense that the contribution of each pixels decays along the distance in a PSF-shaped manner. In principle this means that the distance-factor is smaller for pixels that are further apart. The cross-cumulant approach can be used to create new, virtual pixels revealing true information about the labelled specimen by reducing the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> size. These pixels carry more information than pixels that arise from simple interpolation.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new technique for measuring the modulation transfer function (MTF) of a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. The "nominal" MTF was measured by displaying a line image of a width of one pixel on the CRT monitor using the pattern generator. We also measured the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width. In order to obtain the "actual" MTF, the nominal MTF was divided by the sinc function which is the Fourier transform of the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width.

40|$|Charge sharing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the performance of single-photon counting microstrip detectors, since the comparator threshold defines the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width. In this contribution, the PICASSO (Phase Imaging for Clinical Application with Silicon detector and Synchrotron radiatiOn) single-photon counting microstrip detector oriented in edge-on configuration has been used to study its spatial resolution as a function of the comparator threshold. The experiment was carried out with monochromatic x-rays at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility in Trieste (Italy). The Edge Spread Function (i. e. the integral of the Line spread Function, LSF) was measured by horizontally translating vertical slits from a bar-pattern test-object in front of the detector, at four different photon energies (19, 20, 22, and 25 keV) and for several different values of the comparator threshold. The effect of charge sharing between strips on the spatial resolution has been quantified by calculating the horizontal Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Moreover, the composite LSF from neighboring pixels was obtained: this allowed estimating the optimal threshold for each photon energy by selecting the threshold at which the composite LSF would approach unity along the entire width of the pixel. The results show that at thresholds lower than half of the photon energy, charge sharing increases the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width, causing a drop of the MTF, and it is responsible for the appearance of peaks in the composite LSF. Conversely, at thresholds higher than half of the photon energy, the <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> width is reduced and the spatial resolution is increased, but the collection efficiency is compromised, as demonstrated by the presence of valleys in the composite LSF...|$|E
40|$|The ambitious science {{goals of}} the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) have {{motivated}} a search for new and unexpected sources of systematic error in the LSST camera. Flat-field images are {{a rich source of}} data on sensor anomalies, although such effects are typically dwarfed by shot noise in a single flat field. After combining many (∼ 500) such images into `ultraflats' to reduce the impact of shot noise, we perform photon transfer analysis on a pixel-by-pixel basis and observe no spatial structure in pixel linearity or gain at light levels of 100 ke^- and below. At 125 ke^-, a columnar structure is observed in the gain map [...] we attribute this to a flux-dependent charge transfer inefficiency. We also probe small-scale variations in <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> size by analyzing pixel-neighbor correlations in ultraflat images, where we observe clear evidence of intrinsic variation in <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> size in an LSST prototype sensor near the ∼. 3 % level.

40|$|Image plates (IP) can be {{used for}} {{electron}} detection in the EM like conventional negative material [N. Mori et al., Ultramicroscopy 25 (1988) 195]. The stored information can later be retrieved by a scanning process in form of a digitized image. Although the physics of the electron storage process of the IPs in theory predicts electron detection with high spatial resolution, high detection efficiency and high dynamic range, in practice the scanning process limits resolution and detection efficiency. At present the scanners yield only moderate spatial resolution — about 100 μm <b>effective</b> <b>pixel</b> size (i. e. about 200 μm line resolution [S. Isoda et al., Ultramicroscopy 41 (1992) 99].

These properties are comparable to values published on slow-scan CCD cameras.
