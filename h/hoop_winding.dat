40|$|A new {{consolidation}} {{method for}} the laser-assisted filament winding of thermoplastic prepregs is discussed: {{for the first}} time a diode laser is used, as well as long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene prepregs. A consolidation apparatus was built by means of a CNC motion table, a stepper motor and a simple tensioner. Preliminary tests were performed in a <b>hoop</b> <b>winding</b> configuration: only the winding speed was changed, and all the other process parameters (laser power, distance from the laser focus, consolidation force) were kept constant. Small wound rings with an internal diameter of 25 mm were produced and compression tests were carried out to evaluate the composite agglomeration in dependence of the winding speed. At lower winding speeds, a stronginterpenetration of adjacent layers was observed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the in situ {{consolidation}} of polypropylene matrix/glass reinforced rovings was performed combining two heating systems, an infrared oven {{and a hot}} air gun, and a roll pressing the commingled roving during <b>hoop</b> <b>winding</b> on a cylindrical mandrel. Process parameters were {{set up on the}} basis of a preliminary simulation of the heat transfer along the roving and then comparison of the results with experimental temperature profiles obtained by a noncontact thermometer. Composite samples were cut along the cylinder axis for mechanical characterization. Physical properties, such as density and void content, obtained using different processing conditions, were compared. Electron microscopy was performed in order to assess how processing conditions affect fiber–matrix impregnation.

40|$|Carbon {{composite}} materials and structures have low weight, high stiffness, high strength and chemical resistance. Throughout this master thesis a feasibility study to utilize carbon composites in tubes, designed to withstand high pressures, is undertaken both analytically and experimentally. The tube {{is meant to}} be used for well intervention, replacing the current solid carbon rod. In such operations is low weight, in addition to above mentioned properties, a critical factor for long reach. To extend the reach of the equipment the submerged weight of such a tube must be as low as possible. To enable a tube to withstand the high pressures, which can reach more than 1000 bar, a thick walled tube is the only alternative to decrease the submerged weight compared to a solid rod. Work and literature on thick walled composite tubes with inner diameter to thickness ratios as low as 2 is minimal, if not absent. A two layered laminate structure was chosen for the tube. The inner layer existing of <b>hoop</b> <b>winded</b> fibers and the outer layer of longitudinal UD fibers. Such a layup will give both high radial strength and axial stiffness. Throughout the analysis {{it was found that the}} cause of failure would be instability. This conclusion was drawn as instability would occur before any of the chosen failure criterions were fulfilled. This implies that the strength of the material is utilized maximally. The experimental results had good coherency with the analytical results. Results from physical tests had a large scatter, but this was predicted as a result of a manual production process leading to uneven distribution of fibers and medium to large voids. Several parameters, both regarding load cases and necessary material properties, for the given requirements of the tube have not been assessed. However, results from conducted analytical and experimental work shows that thick walled composite tubes are able to withstand the given loading conditions, together with keeping the submerged weight sufficiently low. Future work based on the results in this thesis should include test results with statistical significance, analyses on the more complex load cases, optimal laminate design and identifying a suitable matrix material which can withstand the necessary temperature requirement. </p...|$|R
40|$|MetPreg ™ is a {{technology}} in which fiber reinforced metals are produced using all the traditional composite processing {{techniques such as}} pultrusion, filament winding, tape placement, hot pressing, and vacuum bagging. This work is significant for applications where the high specific properties and temperature capability of metal matrix composites provide benefits over conventional monolithic metals and organic composites. Touchstone’s metal matrix composite (MMC) technology has advanced significantly {{in the areas of}} filament winding and tape production. The MMC filament winding process is now capable of <b>winding</b> <b>hoop</b> and helical plies. Hydroburst testing of recent cylinder specimens have demonstrated delivered fiber strength of 320 ksi, which represents a translation efficiency of 80 %. This process is now ready to move to the next step of winding end domes and closures. The MetPreg tape manufacturing process has been extended into other materials combinations. Prepreg tape made from high-strength aluminum alloy matrices shows great promise for applications demanding high compression strength. Tape has also been manufactured with continuous carbon fibers in a magnesium matrix. This product is a potential beryllium replacement material and could also be used to manufacture lightweight mortar bipod leg tubes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the interlaminar fracture of filament wound composites. Mode II end notched flexure (ENF) tests were performed on flat glass/polyester specimens. The tested specimens had asymmetric [+/-theta](4) angle-ply stacking-sequences, with theta values from 0. 8 degrees (<b>hoop</b> <b>winding)</b> to 30 degrees. Due to the low stiffness and probable high toughness, {{it was not possible to}} propagate the crack in [+/- 60 degrees](4) specimens before they suffered considerable permanent deformations. A short support span had to be employed for [+/- 30 degrees](4) specimens in order to obtain crack propagation. Nevertheless, the results for those specimens should be viewed with caution, as some nonlinear behaviour and small permanent deformations were detected. No other unusual features, such as crack jumping to other interface, were observed. The scatter in the critical strain energy release rate values (G(IIc)) was higher for [+/- 10 degrees](4) and [+/- 30 degrees](4) specimens than for the quasi-unidirectional ones. G(IIc) values from the insert were generally lower than those from mode II pre-cracks, except for quasi-unidirectional specimens. A plot of average G(IIc) values against theta showed a minimum at theta= 5 degrees...|$|E
40|$|Summary {{accompanying}} the thesis: Energy Absorption of Monolithic and Fibre Reinforced Aluminium Cylinders by Jens de Kanter This thesis presents {{the investigation of}} the crush behaviour of both monolithic aluminium cylinders and externally fibre reinforced aluminium cylinders. The research is based on analytical work, numerical work and experimental work, which together show a complete picture of the tube axial crush phenomenon. The research is relevant for transport safety. In specific for the automotive industry, however with a clear link to the aerospace industry, based on the materials used and current developments in aerospace crashworthiness. Materials used in the investigation are aluminium and fibre composite, both materials extensively used in the aerospace industry. Also the aerospace safety focus is widening nowadays. Where in the past only crash prevention was considered now also crash protection is of concern. Transport safety and also sustainability benefit from reduced mass of the vehicles. In case of crash structures, the mass can be reduced by having components with a higher specific energy absorption (energy absorbed per unit mass, SEA). Further quantitative requirements for energy absorbing tubes are the load ratio, i. e. the peak load divided by the mean load and the stroke efficiency, i. e. the axial displacement divided by the original tube length. Qualitative requirements for the tubes are for example reliability, predictability and post-crash integrity. In search of improved crash tube performance this research followed a trajectory where aluminium tubes are reinforced by fibre composite. In order to gain full insight in the crush phenomena, first the monolithic aluminium tube crush behaviour is described. The aluminium crush behaviour is governed by a number of collapse modes, which depend on the diameter to thickness ratio of the tubes. Basically two collapse modes exist, the axisymmetric or concertina collapse mode and the diamond mode. The diamond collapse mode is characterised by the number of diamond lobes present. For tubes with diameter over thickness ratios in the range of 10 to 100 the number of diamond lobes may vary from two to four. Most of the tubes tested were made of aluminium alloy 6060 -T 66, with a diameter of 50 mm and thickness varying from 0. 5 mm to 2. 5 mm. Within this thickness range the folding takes place in the plastic regime of the material. The experimentally established folding behaviour is well reproduced by analyses with a number of different finite element codes. Abaqus implicit was used for the static simulation and both Abaqus explicit and PAM-CRASH were used for the dynamic situation. The dynamic tube crushing is characterised by a dynamic buckling phenomenon and a small increase of the loads compared to the static situation. The load increase is attributed to the strain rate sensitivity of the metal and due to inertia (of the laterally moving fold elements). Also analytical models are presented for the metal tube crushing. These give good predictions of the mean loads and show the balance in the energy absorption between membrane stretching and fold bending. Shortcoming of the models is the validity over different collapse modes. For improving the SEA, the aluminium cylinders were reinforced by externally winding impregnated S 2 glass fibres. A few tubes were reinforced by carbon fibres and some were reinforced with prepreg in the tube longitudinal direction as well. The fibre winding orientation and lay-up were varied in the experimental program. In the production process some minor variables, as used adhesive and fibre winding tension were examined. The adhesive was used between the aluminium tube and the fibre windings and had a beneficial effect on the energy absorption. The <b>hoop</b> <b>winding</b> reinforcements un-balance the stiffness distribution in the monolithic tube, giving high restoring membrane stresses in circumferential direction, which increase the buckling load and change the folding pattern from a concertina mode to diamond 3 lobe and 2 lobe. The relative increase in SEA is largest (about 20 %) for the single layer reinforcement, with a concertina collapse mode. The thick reinforcements (6 or more layers) caused 2 lobe folding, which has a large fold length and a relatively low SEA, making this configuration less efficient. By changing the orientation of the fibres different collapse modes may be initiated. The experimental program includes the hoop wound specimen (90), hoop wound specimen with UD fibres in longitudinal tube direction (0 degrees/ 90 degrees), helix wound specimen (plusminus 0 degrees), and helix hoop wound specimen (plusminus 0 degrees / 90 degrees). The character of the collapse mode varied from global two lobe folding to small three and four lobe folding. The smaller the folds the higher the mean load and energy absorption. The balanced lay-up of the helix hoop wound specimen (plusminus 45 degrees/ 90 degrees) proved best in energy absorbing performance. The SEA of the monolithic metal tube was increased by 65 %, while the load ratio reduced from 2. 0 to 1. 5. The post crash integrity was diminished however as also cracks were present in the metal.
