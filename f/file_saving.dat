5000|$|As {{soon as the}} new Indian Rupee {{sign was}} approved, Foradian {{technologies}} published a free digital font named [...] "Rupee Foradian" [...] on 16 July 2010. The font and the blog became a viral phenomenon. The font was created using a vector image and its mapping is to the grave accent key of the keyboard, which was chosen because the grave accent key is often not used by computer users. The font received some criticism for the mapping to the grave accent key, and per being released much ahead of its approval for unicode. The Rupee sign may be made visible on some word-processors also where the font is not installed in the system, by choosing to embed the font in the document in <b>file</b> <b>saving</b> options. However, embedding the Foradian Rupee Font renders the document read-only, i.e., the document cannot be edited on a system where the font is not installed.|$|E
50|$|Diane bans Sinead from {{attending}} Katy's funeral, {{much to the}} horror of Sinead and Freddie. Freddie fights for Diane to allow Sinead to go, but Diane refuses and attends the funeral herself. Sinead then receives news of Katy's postmortem, which reveal she had an underlying heart condition and was not poisoned to death, and {{shows up at the}} funeral. She publicly humiliates Diane and slaps her, before ordering everybody to leave the funeral so she can have time alone with Katy's coffin. Diane is desperate to make amends with Sinead and begs for forgiveness on several occasions, and eventually Sinead relents and forgives her, however, this is revealed to be fake and Sinead is secretly planning even worse revenge on Diane. Diane and Sinead discover Finn looking at a video that he filmed of him violently attacking Blessing Chambers (Modupe Adeyeye) because she was a transgender, and Sinead is adamant that they should hand Finn in, but Diane refuses and deletes the <b>file,</b> <b>saving</b> Finn and implicating Finn's innocent friend Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) in the process. Secretly, Sinead seduces Tony in order to get revenge on Diane for good for not believing her over Katy's death, but she ends up falling for Tony and the two embark on an affair in secret. Diane is horrified when John Paul then reveals that Finn raped him after Finn attempts to rape Nancy Osborne (Jessica Fox) - but firmly supports her son. Diane and Tony are subjected to a hate campaign from the McQueens because of this, and The Hutch is vandalized several times. During the trial, Diane continues to support Finn when he claims John Paul molested him, but eventually betrays him and allows him to be found guilty of John Paul's rape. She is devastated when Finn refuses to see her, and breaks down to John Paul over it: apologising to him for everything she and Finn did in the process. Diane is injured after being attacked by Ste when he attempts to steal from The Hutch to fuel his drug habit, but makes a full recovery and remains unaware of Sinead and Tony's affair.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The ever {{increasing}} use of World Wide Web in the existing network, results in poor performance. Several techniques {{have been developed for}} reducing web traffic by compressing the size of the <b>file,</b> <b>saving</b> the web pages at the client side, changing the burst nature of traffic into constant rate etc. No single method was adequate enough to access the document instantly through the Internet. In this paper, adaptive hybrid algorithms are developed for reducing web traffic. Intelligent agents are used for monitoring the web traffic. Depending upon the bandwidth usage, user’s preferences, server and browser capabilities, intelligent agents use the best techniques to achieve maximum traffic reduction. Web caching, compression, filtering, optimization of HTML tags, and traffic dispersion are incorporated into this adaptive selection. Using this new hybrid technique, latency is reduced to 20 – 60 % and cache hit ratio is increased 40 – 82 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} some of {{the features}} of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and its uses in the teaching-learning process in elementary schools. In most schools, it is difficult for ICT to be used effectively in the teaching-learning process. The author observed many classes using ICT in elementary schools. Qualitative data, such as interviews with teachers and observation of student conversations and behaviors were analyzed. The research findings were based on ethnographic case studies and are summarized as statements. The findings were summarized and are presented as a causal relation graph. The main results were: (1) Basic computer operating skills, such as typewriting depend largely on the classroom teacher's attitude and computer literacy; (2) most computer operation skills, such as <b>file</b> <b>saving,</b> and design skills, such as designing and developing a omepage were mastered through reciprocal teaching and modeling among children; (3) the teacher's advice helps children to search and acces...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a teaching software that allows students and researchers {{to understand how}} passive and active experiments can be made, without making real experiments. The software generates experimental data for a wooden milling process based on an experimental design for two factors, y=f(x 1, x 2). The data pass through different modules which simulate a data acquisition system that convert the analog simulated data into digital data which are recorded into text files. The software has five modules: a process module, a current transformer module, a power transducer module, a data acquisition module and a <b>file</b> <b>saving</b> module. The interface of the software follows these modules and allows the user to set very easily the input and output values of every module. After simulation of all experiments and processing the recorded data, the experimental design can be completed with the measured values. With this information and with adequate software, a mathematical model of the process can be obtained very easily...|$|E
40|$|ROOT {{provides}} an flexible format {{used throughout the}} HEP community. The number of use cases - from an archival data format to end-stage analysis - has required a number of tradeoffs {{to be exposed to}} the user. For example, a high "compression level" in the traditional DEFLATE algorithm will result in a smaller <b>file</b> (<b>saving</b> disk space) at the cost of slower decompression (costing CPU time when read). At the scale of the LHC experiment, poor design choices can result in terabytes of wasted space or wasted CPU time. We explore and attempt to quantify some of these tradeoffs. Specifically, we explore: the use of alternate compressing algorithms to optimize for read performance; an alternate method of compressing individual events to allow efficient random access; and a new approach to whole-file compression. Quantitative results are given, as well as guidance on how to make compression decisions for different use cases.

40|$|When a user uploads audio {{files to}} a music stream- ing service, these files are {{subsequently}} re-encoded to lower bitrates to target different devices, e. g. low bitrate for mobile. To {{save time and}} bandwidth uploading files, some users encode their original files using a lossy codec. The metadata for these files cannot always be trusted as users might have encoded their files more than once. Determining the lowest bitrate of the files allows the streaming service to skip the process of encoding the files to bitrates {{higher than that of}} the uploaded <b>files,</b> <b>saving</b> on processing and storage space. This paper presents a model that uses quality predictions from ViSQOLAudio, a full reference objective audio quality metric, as features in combination with a multi-class support vector machine classifier. An experiment on twice-encoded files found that low bitrate codecs could be classified using audio quality features. The experiment also provides insights into the implications of multiple transcodes from a quality perspective...|$|R
