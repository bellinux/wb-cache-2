40|$|Abstract The {{distribution}} of item generation/time {{in the performance}} of elderly on verbal fluency (VF) remains unknown. Objective: To analyze the number of items, their distribution and impact of the first quartile on the final test result. Methods: 31 individuals performed the tests (average age= 74 years; schooling= 8. 16 years). Results: The number of <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> the first quartile differed from the other quartiles for both semantic and phonologic VF where 40 % of <b>items</b> were <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> the first quartile. No effect of age was found and schooling influenced performance on the first and second quartiles of semantic VF and on the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd quartiles of phonemic VF. Discussion: This study contributes with the finding that asymptotic levels are attained prior to the 30 seconds observed in other studies, being reached at the 15 -second mark. Furthermore, schooling was found to be associated to the number of <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> both the first and 2 nd quartiles for semantic VF, and in 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd quartiles for phonemic fluency. Conclusion: The schooling effect was noted both in semantic and executive aspects of VF. The brief form of the VF test may represent a promising tool for clinical evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Consider the {{monitoring}} {{of an ongoing}} production process subject to complete inspection. Inferior quality products are either reworked or scrapped to assure good outgoing quality. Whenever the quality characteristic of a product exceeds a predetermined action limit, remedial action is taken to restore the process to an in-control state.

Taking a learning action would improve the mean value of the quality characteristic of <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> an out-of-control state.

40|$|Among the handicraft, art {{of being}} a {{coppersmith}} has been occurred intensively in the past. The fast developing socio - economic structure diminished the value and {{the place of the}} copper vessels. Heavy and beautiful vessels made by beating left their places to thin, light aluminum, pl astic, glass and steel vessels made by machinery. The demand for copper is diminished. Therefore being a coppersmith has become less and less important every day. However, in the last few years, copper vessels becoming a touristic souvenir became a source of hope for the traditional coppersmith art to live on. Copperworking is applied in our country in some regions and there are people who live off it. Souvenirs, daily used vessels, and requirements of the rural areas are <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> centers such as İstanb ul, Ankara, Tokat, Çorum, Erzincan, Diyarbakır, Kahramanmaraş, Gaziantep, Bursa, Kastamonu, Çankırı, Giresun and Trabzon.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{integrating}} production and distribution planning over periods of a finite horizon. We consider a capacity-constrained plant that produces a number of items distributed by a fleet of homogenous vehicles to customers with known demand for each item in each period. The production planning defines the amount of each <b>item</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> every period, while the distribution planning defines when customers should be visited, the amount of each item that should be delivered to customers, and the vehicle routes. The objective is to minimize production and inventory costs at the plant, inventory costs at the customers and distribution costs. We propose two tabu search variants for this problem, one that involves construction and a short-term memory, and one that incorporates a longer term memory used to integrate a path relinking procedure to the first variant. The proposed tabu search variants are tested on generated instances with up to ten items and on instances from the literature involving a single item...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers {{got around}} {{the problem of}} an {{inherent}} similarity in their products in various ways. First, they would frequently change designs according to demand. This was especially so in the export-dependent factories of Bohemia where salesmen would report sales trends back to the factory during each trip. Second, the decoration for mid- and lower-market items, often done by contracted [...] "piece" [...] workers, was often a variation on a theme. Such was the skill of these subcontractors that a reasonable standard of quality and {{a high rate of}} output were generally maintained. Finally, a high degree of differentiation could be gained from the multiplication of shapes, colours, and decorative designs, yielding many different combinations. Concurrently, from the same factories came distinctive, artistic <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> more limited quantities for the upper-market consumer. These were decorated in-house where decorators could work closely with designers and management <b>in</b> order to <b>produce</b> a piece that was profitable.|$|R
40|$|The {{retirement}} age of industrial workers in national pension schemes is being raised. However, many industrial workers {{are not able}} to work until they have reached the increased {{retirement age}}. This problem is decreasing social security, increasing workers anxiety regarding the future and influencing the quality and timing of production processes. Disruptions and lower quality <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> one activity cell of a supply chain can have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain. To solve this problem, we should put in place supplementary occupational pension schemes, which would compensate firms for the depreciated ability of their elderly workers to work when they have reached the previous retirement age but have not yet reached the new, higher retirement age. This article is introduces a model that is based on extended MRP Theory. The model {{can be used as a}} basis for negotiations between employers and employees to keep production at the same level of quality. The trade-off between higher contributions to supplementary occupational pension schemes and lower added values is considered. Contributions enable the early retirement of industrial workers at one or more workplaces in a supply chain, while lower added value is the result of lower quality and the perturbed timing of <b>items</b> that are <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> one or more activity cells of a supply chain: these issues have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain.

40|$|The production, {{transport}} and processing of food products have significant environmental impacts, {{some of them}} related to climate change. This study examined the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and transport to a port in Sweden (wholesale point) of 84 common food items of animal and vegetable origin. Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for food <b>items</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> different countries and using various means of production were compared.

Analyses of the nutritional value of the foods to assess the amount of protein delivered to the wholesale point per unit energy used or GHG emitted (protein delivery efficiency) showed that the efficiency was much higher for plant-based foods than for animal-based. Remarkably, the efficiency of delivering plant-based protein increased as the amount of protein in the food increased, while the efficiency of delivering animal-based protein decreased. These results have implications for policies encouraging diets with lower environmental impacts for a growing world population.
