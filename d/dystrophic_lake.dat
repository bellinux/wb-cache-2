In the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>Lake</b> Flosek in Poland, the abundance peaks of autotrophic picoplankton and phytoplankton varied from non-dystropic lakes. In the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> Flosek, there were two abundance peaks of autotrophic picoplankton and phytoplankton, while non-dystrophic lakes had one abundance peak.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerous}} <b>dystrophic</b> (humic) <b>lakes</b> are a {{very important}} feature of Wigry National Park, NE Poland. As the most recent palaeoecological data indicate, {{at the beginning of}} its development (in the Late Glacial and Early and Middle Holocene) these water bodies functioned as harmonious lakes, and their transformation into <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and the stabilization of the trophic state took place {{at the beginning of the}} Subboreal. Palynological analysis of sediments from two such lakes (Lake Ślepe and Lake Suchar II), with special emphasis on non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), was aimed at a detailed biological characterization of <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> during their long-lasting existence. The obtained results allowed for the designation of organisms characteristic for <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> of which representatives appeared with the decreasing pH of the water and the formation of Sphagnum peat around lakes. These organisms were divided into four groups: algae, fungi, testate amoebas, and animals. Their representatives appear invarious developmental stages of <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> {{refers to}} a lake {{containing}} brown- or tea-coloured water {{which is the result}} of high concentrations of humic substances and organic acids suspended in the water. In response to historical misuse of the term in literature, these lakes are better referred to as [...] "humic lakes". Although dystrophic lakes are often considered acidic and nutrient-poor (oligotrophic), these lakes actually vary greatly in terms of both pH and productivity. [...] Due to the low pH associated with dystrophic lakes, few bacterial species and other aquatic life are able to survive. [...] They are common in the taiga of North America and Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|Store Gribsø (English: Large Grib-lake), or just Gribsø, {{is only a}} 10 ha lake, but is {{nevertheless}} the largest lake enclosed by Gribskov. It is a so-called <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> and {{it is impossible to}} see the bottom in its dark waters, even though it is only 11 m deep. The lake has no outflows and it can be ice cold just beneath the surface, so care should be taken when bathing. Tradition says the lake is bottomless and was created when God angrily punished a nunnery that once was here. The nuns showed more interest in the monks at Esrum Abbey than in God, so he opened up the ground and the chasm swallowed up all the nuns and the entire monastery. The monastery continued to sink and sink and that was how the lake was created. It is said that one can still hear the monastery's bells ringing down in the lake on quiet evenings.|$|E

40|$|Reports of {{unexpectedly}} 13 C-depleted chironomid larvae {{in lakes}} {{have led to}} an hypothesis that significant transfer of detrital organic matter to chironomid larvae may occur via methane-cycle bacteria. However, to date little is known of how such transfer might vary across species and lakes. We gathered data from 87 lakes to determine how widespread this phenomenon might be and to define boundaries for its likely magnitude. Carbon stable isotope values of chironomid larvae varied greatly between taxa. Very marked 13 C-depletion was evident only in certain taxa, especially Chironomus plumosus, C. anthracinus, and C. tenuistylus, all characteristic of eutrophic or <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and known to be tolerant of low oxygen conditions. Furthermore, marked 13 C-depletion was only found in larvae from lakes in which late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen depletion near the sediment surface was below an apparent threshold concentration of 2 – 4 mg O 2 /L. Similarly, application of a two-source mixing model suggested that methanotrophic bacteria made the greatest contribution to profundal chironomid growth (0 – 70 % of larval carbon) when the late-summer oxygen concentration dropped below ∼ 2 mg O 2 /L. Our study demonstrates that methane-derived carbon is an important, but often neglected, contribution to the flux of carbon through the food webs of many productive or <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Limnology classifies lakes (or {{other bodies}} of water) {{according}} to the trophic state index. An oligotrophic lake is characterised by relatively low levels of primary production {{and low levels of}} nutrients. A eutrophic lake has high levels of primary productivity due to very high nutrient levels. Eutrophication of a lake can lead to algal blooms. <b>Dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> have high levels of humic matter and typically has yellow-brown, tea-coloured waters. [...] These categories do not have rigid specifications; the classification system can be seen as more of a spectrum encompassing the various levels of aquatic productivity.|$|R
40|$|Whole-lake {{additions}} of dissolved inorganic C- 13 {{were used}} to measure allochthony (the terrestrial contribution of organic carbon to aquatic consumers) in two unproductive lakes (Paul and Peter Lakes in 2001), a nutrient-enriched lake (Peter Lake in 2002), and a <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> (Tuesday Lake in 2002). Three kinds of dynamic models {{were used to}} estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of delta(13) CO(2); and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of delta(13) C in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zooplankton, Chaoborus, and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources {{accounted for more than}} half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched experiments. Allochthony was highest in the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> and lowest in the nutrient-enriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of zooplankton from 0. 34 - 0. 48 to 0 - 0. 12, and of fishes from 0. 51 - 0. 80 to 0. 25 - 0. 55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape...|$|E

We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and heterotrophic microbial community productivity throughout a 72 -h incubation period, characterized DOM quality by molecular weight, and determined microbial community structure at the initial and final time points.

40|$|An {{important}} conclusion {{from the}} acid rain research {{during the late}} 1970 's and the early 1980 's, was that humic substances (HS) in the water affected the response of acid rain. HS acts as a modifier on both the chemical composition and on the biological activity of acidified surface water. The Humex project will, by artificial acidification of a whole catchment, study the role of HS on the acidification {{and the role of}} acidification on the biological properties of HS. In fall 1988, a <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> was divided in two halves by a plastic curtain, {{from the middle of the}} natural outlet to the opposite side. During the following two years, through September 1990, the water chemistry of the two lake halves has been monitored and a number of scientists from Europe and North America have been studying the organic matter and the biota in the water, and in the catchment area prior to the artificial acidification, which started October 6 th 1990.

40|$|Humic acid (HA) is a {{principal}} component of humic substances, which are the major organic constituents of soil, peat, coal, many upland streams, <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and ocean water.

This work aimed to characterize the HA extracted and purified from the Candiota coalfield (Brazil) by visible (VIS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), inductively coupled plasma absorption emission (ICP-AES), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopies, thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of these analyses showed that Candiota HA presents a high degree of humification, which is considered to be type A with a turbostratic structure.

40|$|Analyses {{of carbon}} stable {{isotopes}} {{are often used}} to estimate the contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous dietary resources to aquatic consumers. Most pelagic food web studies assume that all phytoplankton taxa have a similar delta C- 13 value. We studied pelagic food web compartments (dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], phytoplankton, bacteria, seston, cladoceran zooplankton) in 12 small (< 0. 1 km(2)) lakes in southern Finland. These lakes were classified as oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and dystrophic based on their concentrations of total phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon. Additionally, we studied phytoplankton photosynthetic carbon fractionation (epsilon(p)) in laboratory conditions. The photosynthetic fractionation in 28 phytoplankton cultures from nine different phytoplankton classes varied significantly at the class level, and fractionation correlated significantly with the DIC concentration of the growth media. In small boreal lakes, the delta C- 13 values of different phytoplankton taxa, as directly measured or estimated from the delta C- 13 values of biomarker fatty acids, varied greatly (- 18 parts per thousand to - 44. 5 parts per thousand). Phytoplankton delta C- 13 values varied significantly by lake type and were most depleted in <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> even though the delta C- 13 values of the DIC was similar to mesotrophic lakes. Further within-taxa variation was found between lakes and between different depths within a lake. Vertical samples from <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> also showed lower ep in the phytoplankton from meta-and hypolimnion, possibly {{as a result of}} reduced light intensity. Altogether, in nine of the 10 sampled lakes, the delta C- 13 values of cladoceran zooplankton were between the minimum and the maximum phytoplankton delta C- 13 value of each lake, and thus, phytoplankton alone could explain zooplankton delta C- 13 values. We conclude that stable isotope mixing models should take into account carbon variation among different phytoplankton taxa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFish are an {{important}} source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for birds, mammals and humans. In aquatic food webs, these highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) are essential for many physiological processes and mainly synthetized by distinct phytoplankton taxa. Consumers at different trophic levels obtain essential fatty acids from their diet because they cannot produce these sufficiently de novo. Here, we evaluated how the increase in phosphorus concentration (eutrophication) or terrestrial organic matter inputs (brownification) change EPA and DHA content in the phytoplankton. Then, we evaluated whether these changes {{can be seen in the}} EPA and DHA content of piscivorous European perch (Perca fluviatilis), which is a widely distributed species and commonly consumed by humans. Data from 713 lakes showed statistically significant differences in the abundance of EPA- and DHA-synthesizing phytoplankton as well as in the concentrations and content of these essential fatty acids among oligo-mesotrophic, eutrophic and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> The EPA and DHA content of phytoplankton biomass (mgHUFAg− 1) was significantly lower in the eutrophic lakes than in the oligo-mesotrophic or <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> We found a strong significant correlation between the DHA content in the muscle of piscivorous perch and phytoplankton DHA content (r= 0. 85) as well with the contribution of DHA-synthesizing phytoplankton taxa (r= 0. 83). Among all DHA-synthesizing phytoplankton this correlation was the strongest with the dinoflagellates (r= 0. 74) and chrysophytes (r= 0. 70). Accordingly, the EPA+DHA content of perch muscle decreased with increasing total phosphorus (r 2 = 0. 80) and dissolved organic carbon concentration (r 2 = 0. 83) in the lakes. Our results suggest that although eutrophication generally increase biomass production across different trophic levels, the high proportion of low-quality primary producers reduce EPA and DHA content in the food web up to predatory fish. Ultimately, it seems that lake eutrophication and brownification decrease the nutritional quality of fish for human consumers...|$|R
40|$|AN ACID LAKE OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS - The lake of Lispach is {{situated}} in the higher Vosges, at 912 metres above the sea-level. It is a <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake,</b> with acid, brown coloured waters. Inspite of its shallowness (io m 3), the bottom water is always ata low and steady temperature varying between 4 ° 5 and 6 ° C. This determines a very distinct thermocline during the warmseason. The hydrogen ion concentration varies from 5, 3 to 6, 5. The surface water is invariably supplied well enough withdissolved oxygen (5, 05 to 8, 6 cm 3 per litre); but the bottom isalways very poor, if not unprovided with this gas (0, 4 to 1, 5 cm 3 per litre). The quantity of electrolytes is very low. Soluble phosphorusand silica are relatively plentiful at bottom : respectively, 8 to 80 mmgr. per ton of water, and 6, 5 to 10, 7 mmgr. per litre, accordingto seasons. At the surface, the contents are lower : from 4 to 11 mmgr. per ton for phosphorus and from 4, 7 to 8, 2 mmgr. per litre for silica. The amount of soluble phosphorus in thebottom water, through the different seasons, is a function ofthe quantity of zooplankton in the surface water. This surface water is rich in zooplankton, but chiefly insummer. It contains various species of Entomostracea whichgive to the lake a rather well marked northerly- alpine character...|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a {{persistent}} contaminant present naturally in our environment but, {{as a result}} of anthropogenic activity, has now accumulated in lake sediments at concentrations 2. 2 times greater than those found in pre-industrial sediments (pre- 1850) (Chapter 2). However, present spatial patterns of mercury accumulation do not match patterns in natural mercury accumulation (Chapter 4). Once spatially uniform across south-central Ontario, mercury concentrations in present-day lake sediment display strong spatial correlation. Further, the broad scale spatial patterns (> 500 km) which correlate with mean annual precipitation (MAP) found to significantly predict pre-industrial sediment Hg, has now been replaced with finer scale spatial patterns (< 120 km). Rather than one significant spatial scale explaining sediment Hg, as during the pre-industrial era (p = 0. 01), present sediment Hg are predicted by more than one spatial scale (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 001) both of which are highly correlated with lake pH. While MAP and lake pH explain much variance in mercury accumulation, their significance is spatially dependent. In addition to differences in spatial trends, models which suggest that pre-industrial sediment Hg was in steady state with watershed accumulation do not apply to present day Hg accumulation (Chapter 2). Instead, Hg enrichment in lake sediment decreased as a function of drainage ratio (R 2 = 0. 458, p = 0. 0001), suggesting that Hg export from watersheds may be lagging behind atmospheric Hg deposition. The enrichment of Hg since the pre-industrial era is also influenced by the amount of open water (r = 0. 91, p = 0. 035), mining activity (r = 0. 94, p = 0. 019) and organic deposits within surficial geology (r = - 0. 91, p = 0. 034) which lead to local hot and cold spots (Chapter 4). There is a close link between the present-day sediment Hg concentrations and that in dorsal muscle of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieul) (r = 0. 92, p = 0. 0002) (Chapter 3). However, the discrepancies that do exist between these two components are determined by landcover, longitude, and dissolved organic carbon. An examination of methylmercury in two catchments revealed that the concentration of methylmercury in stream water from ten watersheds is predicted from a time sensitive (lagged regression) interaction among sulfate (tpartial = 9. 60, p < 0. 001), dissolved organic carbon (tpartial = 7. 06, p < 0. 001), and temperature (tpartial = 4. 44, p < 0. 001) (Appendix A). The error of which decreases exponentially with increasing wetland size (R 2 = 0. 838, p = 0. 0105). The difference between methylmercury inflow and outflow (MeHgNet) within these two catchments (a dystrophic and an oligotrophic lake) was seasonally dependent (Chapter 5). However, seasonal accumulation and loss of methylmercury was significantly larger in magnitude within the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake.</b> Further, a net production of methylmercury was found in the <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> alone (1. 9 +/- 0. 3 mg·d - 1). This study examines Hg contamination in a relatively pristine, remote environment which like other regions, has been challenged by contaminants originating from far distances...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change with}} higher air {{temperatures}} {{and changes in}} cloud cover, radiation and wind speed alters the heat balance and stratification patterns of lakes. A paired whole-lake thermocline manipulation experiment of a small (0. 047 km 2) shallow <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> (Halsjärvi) {{was carried out in}} southern Finland. A thermodynamic model (MyLake) was used for both predicting the impacts of climate change scenarios and for determining the manipulation target of the experiment. The model simulations assuming several climate change scenarios indicated large increases in the whole-lake monthly mean temperature (+ 1. 4 – 4. 4 °C in April–October for the A 2 scenario), and shortening of the length of the ice covered period by 56 – 89 days. The thermocline manipulation resulted in large changes in the thermodynamic properties of the lake, and those were rather well consistent with the simulated future increases in the heat content during the summer-autumn season. The manipulation also resulted in changes in the oxygen stratification, and the expansion of the oxic water layer increased the spatial extent of the sediment surface oxic-anoxic interfaces. In addition, the experiment affected several other chemical constituents; concentrations of organic carbon, TotN, and NH 4 showed a statistically significant decrease, likely due to both changes in hydrological conditions during the experiment period and increased decomposition and sedimentation. In comparison with the results of a similar whole-lake manipulation experiment in a deep, oligotrophic, clear-watered lake in Norway, it is evident that shallow dystrophic lakes, common in the boreal region, are more sensitive to physical perturbations. This means that projected climate change may modify their physical and chemical conditions in the future...|$|E

40|$|AIM: This study {{determined}} the temporal {{variation of the}} biomass and the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in Azolla filiculoides Lam. in a small (0. 5 ha) shallow <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lake</b> located {{in the city of}} Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil). METHOD: Sampling was conducted monthly between November 2000 and October 2001. The macrophytes were collected randomly in three replicates with a circular collector 0. 3 m in diameter and subsequently washed with tap water and oven-dried at 60 ºC for determination of the dry weight and the nutrient status (i. e., carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus). Primary productivity was estimated by the variation in biomass among successive samples. RESULTS: A. filiculoides was present in the lake throughout the year and occupied between 50 and 80 % of the surface area. The biomass values ranged from 34. 2 g DW. m- 2, recorded in May (autumn), to 170. 9 g DW. m- 2 in January (summer). The highest rate of primary productivity was 3. 3 g DW. m- 2. d- 1, observed in June.

OBJETIVO: Este estudo determinou a variação temporal da biomassa e as concentrações de carbono, nitrogênio e fósforo de Azolla filiculoides Lam., em um pequeno lago raso distrófico situado no município do Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil). MÉTODO: As amostragens foram realizadas mensalmente no período entre novembro de 2000 e outubro de 2001. As macrófitas foram coletadas aleatoriamente em três repetições, utilizando-se coletor circular de 0, 3 m de diâmetro e posteriormente lavadas com água corrente e secas em estufa 60 ºC para determinação do peso seco e dos nutrientes: carbono, nitrogênio e fósforo. A produção primária foi estimada pela variação de biomassa entre coletas sucessivas. RESULTADOS: A. filiculoides esteve presente no lago durante todo o ano, ocupando sempre entre 50 e 80 % da superfície do lago. Os valores de biomassa variaram entre 34, 2 g PS. m- 2, registrado em maio (outono) e 170, 9 g PS. m- 2 em janeiro (verão). A maior taxa de produtividade primária foi 3, 3 g PS. m- 2. d- 1 foi registrada em Junho. As concentrações de carbono, nitrogênio e fósforo na planta variaram entre: 403 e 551 g. kg- 1, 13, 4 e 25, 7 g. kg- 1 e 0, 5 e 1, 9 g. kg- 1, respectivamente. Os valores da relação N:P na coluna de água variou entre 19 : 1 e 368 : 1. CONCLUSÃO: A cobertura da superfície do lago por A. filiculoides durante todo o período do estudo e o seu estado nutricional demonstram sua importância na ciclagem dos nutrientes neste ambiente aquático. A maior relação N:P na coluna de água quando comparada a outro ambiente próximo sem a presença desta macrófita, apoia a ideia de que A. filiculoides pode ser a responsável pelo enriquecimento do lago por meio da atividade de fixação biológica de nitrogênio...|$|E
40|$|In aquatic ecosystems, {{predation}} {{is affected}} both by turbulence and visibility, but the combined effects are poorly known. Both factors are changing in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere; the average levels of turbulence are predicted to increase due to increasing wind activities, while water transparency is decreasing, e. g., due to variations in precipitation, and sediment resuspension. We explored experimentally how turbulence influenced {{the effects of}} planktivorous fish and invertebrate predators on zooplankton when it was combined with low visibility caused by high levels of water color. The study was conducted as a factorial design in 24 outdoor ponds, using the natural zooplankton community as a prey population. Perch and roach were used as vertebrate predators and Chaoborus flavicans larvae as invertebrate predators. In addition to calm conditions, the turbulent dissipation rate used in the experiments was 10 - 6 m 2 s- 3, and the water color was 140 mg Pt L- 1. The results demonstrated that in a system dominated by invertebrates, predation pressure on cladocerans increased considerably under intermediate turbulence. Under calm conditions, chaoborids caused only a minor reduction in the crustacean biomass. The effect of fish predation on cladocerans was slightly reduced by turbulence, while predation on cyclopoids was strongly enhanced. Surprisingly, under turbulent conditions fish reduced cyclopoid biomass, whereas in calm water it increased {{in the presence of}} fish. We thus concluded that turbulence affects fish selectivity. The results suggested that in <b>dystrophic</b> invertebrate-dominated <b>lakes,</b> turbulence may severely affect the abundance of cladocerans. In fish-dominated <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> on the other hand, turbulence-induced changes in planktivory may considerably affect copepods instead of cladocerans. In lakes inhabited by both invertebrates and fish, the response of top-down regulation to turbulence resembles that in fish-dominated systems, due to intraguild predation. The changes in planktivorous predation induced by abiotic factors may possibly cascade to primary producers...|$|R
50|$|Humic acids are a {{principal}} component of humic substances, {{which are the}} major organic constituents of soil (humus), peat and coal. It is also a major organic constituent of many upland streams, <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> and ocean water. It is produced by biodegradation of dead organic matter. It {{is not a single}} acid; rather, it is a complex mixture of many different acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups so that the mixture behaves functionally as a dibasic acid or, occasionally, as a tribasic acid. Humic acids can form complexes with ions that are commonly found in the environment creating humic colloids. Humic acids are insoluble in water at acid pH, whereas fulvic acids are also derived from humic substances but are soluble in water across the full range of pH. Humic and fulvic acids are commonly used as a soil supplement in agriculture, and less commonly as a human nutritional supplement. As a nutrition supplement, fulvic acid {{can be found in a}} liquid form as a component of mineral colloids. Fulvic acids are poly-electrolytes and are unique colloids that diffuse easily through membranes whereas all other colloids do not.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{cellulose}} breakdown and density of bacterial populations were {{measured in the}} epilimnetic sediments and water columns of lakes in central Ontario that differ in pH, alkalinity, and nutrient status and are particularly sensitive to acidic inputs from atmospheric decomposition. There {{was no significant difference}} in decomposition rate in either oxic or anoxic sediment when mean epilimnetic pHs were in the range 5. 5 to 6. 9. The importance of these findings for the breakdown of autochthonous detritus in Canadian Shield lakes is discussed. Furthermore, the results of these experiments, in which dyed strips of cellophane (regenerated cellulose) were used as substrate, were compared with results of earlier decomposition studies carried out with coarse litter (leaves, twigs). Acridine orange direct counts of bacteria in the top 1 cm of sediment ranged from 5. 5 × 108 to 1. 0 × 109 per g and in planktonic water samples from 1. 1 × 106 to 1. 8 × 106 per ml. Bacterial densities were significantly higher in both the shallow sediment (P < 0. 01) and the water column (P < 0. 05) of <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> than at these sites in oligotrophic lakes...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasion}} of the freshwaters of Belarus by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), began at least 200 {{years ago by the}} opening of shipping canals linking the Black Sea and Baltic Sea drainage basins. However, zebra mussels have invaded only 93 (16. 87 o) of 553 studied lakes; at least 20 of these lakes were invaded within in the past 30 years. Zebra mussels were found disproportionately in lakes that were mesotrophic, larger, and had some commercial fishing. Although larger lakes have more intensive fisheries with larger catches, the intensity of the fishery and average catch did not affect the probability of zebra mussel invasion. Zebra mussels were not found in <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> (l of the lakes studied), probably due to their low pH and calcium content. Zebra mussels became locally extinct in one lake due to anthropogenic eutrophication and pollution. Many ecologically suitable lakes have yet to be invaded, which suggests that natural vectors of overland dispersal, e. g., waterfowl, have been ineffective in Belarus. Thus, future spread of this species will continue to depend on human activities such as commercial fishins...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of free neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars were determined in freshwater samples of distinct matrix complexity, including meso-, eu- and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and ponds, using high-performance ion-exclusion chromatography (HPIEC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). In contrast to other methods, our approach allowed the quantification of free neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars at low nM concentrations without derivatization, de-salting or pre-concentration. New sample preparation procedures were applied prior to injection employing syringe and hollow fiber filtration. Analytes were separated on a strong cation exchange resin under 100 % aqueous conditions using 0. 1 % formic acid as a mobile phase. To minimize background noise in MS, analytes were detected in a multiple reaction monitoring scan mode with double ion filtering. Detection limits of carbohydrates and amino sugars ranged between 0. 2 and 2 nM {{at a signal-to-noise ratio}} > 5. Error ranged between 1 and 12 % at 0. 5 - 500 nM levels. Using a stable isotope dilution approach, both the utilization and recycling of glucose in Lake Zurich was observed. In contrast, N-acetyl-glucosamine was equally rapidly consumed {{but there was}} no visible de novo production. The simple and rapid sample preparation makes our protocol suitable for routine analyses of organic compounds in freshwater samples. Application of stable isotope tracers along with accurate measures of carbohydrate and amino sugar concentrations enables novel insights into the compound in situ dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{highlight}} {{the diversity and}} significance of marine phototrophic microorganisms such as picocyanobacteria, phototrophic picoeukaryotes, and bacteriochlorophyll- and rhodopsin-holding phototrophic bacteria. To assess if freshwater ecosystems also harbor similar phototroph diversity, genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll were targeted to explore oxygenic and aerobic anoxygenic phototroph composition {{in a wide range}} of lakes. Partial dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR) and chlorophyllide oxidoreductase (COR) genes in bacteria of seven lakes with contrasting trophic statuses were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Out of 61 sequences encoding the L subunit of DPOR (L-DPOR), 22 clustered with aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, whereas 39 L-DPOR sequences related to oxygenic phototrophs, like cyanobacteria, were observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clear separation of these freshwater L-DPOR genes as well as 11 COR gene sequences from their marine counterparts. Terminal restriction fragment length analysis of L-DPOR genes was used to characterize oxygenic aerobic and anoxygenic photosynthesizing populations in 20 lakes differing in physical and chemical characteristics. Significant differences in L-DPOR community composition were observed between <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and all other systems, where a higher proportion of genes affiliated with aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria was observed than in other systems. Our results reveal a significant diversity of phototrophic microorganisms in lakes and suggest niche partitioning of oxygenic and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs in these systems in response to trophic status and coupled differences in light regime.

30|$|As {{defined by}} Markert et al. (2003), bioindicators are organisms (or, e.g., communities) that contain {{information}} {{on the quality of}} the environment, whereas biomonitors are organisms (or, e.g., communities) that contain {{information on the}} quantitative prospects of the environment. Thus, biomonitors are always bioindicators as well. In general, cladocerans fulfill many of the characteristics that are deemed important for any bioindicator organism. Namely, cladocerans are sensitive to pollution (Von Der Ohe and Liess 2004) and have short life cycles (Smirnov 2017), resulting in rapid responses to environmental stress. Recently, cladocerans have been used to study community level responses to environmental variables in many types of environments, e.g., <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> in central Europe (Zawisza et al. 2016), subarctic lakes in Finland (Leppänen et al. 2016) and crater lakes in western Uganda (Rumes et al. 2011). The potential of cladocerans as a community level indicator tool in mining pollution studies is highlighted in the results of this review as the community shifts are clearly visible in most of the studies which span from pre- to post impact conditions. In addition, most of the results indicate distinct differences between impacted and reference sites. However, whether the overall conditions of an ecosystem can be determined by studying only one group of organisms is the central question in every bioindicator application (Markert et al. 2003) but due to the central location in food webs, the cladoceran community has the potential to reflect the surrounding environment in great detail.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{conducted}} a 3 -year artificial deepening of the thermocline in the dimictic Lake Breisjøen, southern Norway, {{by means of}} a large submerged propeller. An adjacent lake served as untreated reference. The manipulation increased thermocline depth from 6 to 20 m, caused {{a significant increase in the}} heat content, and delayed ice-on by about 20 days. There were only minor changes in water chemistry. Concentrations of sulphate declined, perhaps due to greater reduction of sulphate at the sediment-water interface. Concentrations of particulate carbon and nitrogen decreased, perhaps due to increased sedimantation velocity. Water transparency increased. There was no significant change in concentration of phosphorus, the growth-limiting nutrient. There were few significant changes in principal biological components. Phytoplankton biomass and productivity did not change, although the chlorophyll-a concentration showed a small decrease. Phytoplankton species richness increased, and the species composition shifted. Growth of periphyton increased. There was no change in the macrophyte community. The manipulation did not affect the zooplankton biodiversity, but caused a significant shift in the relative abundance (measured as biomass) in the two major copepod species. The manipulation did not affect the individual density, but appeared to have changed the vertical distribution of zoobenthos. Fish populations were not affected. The lake is oligotrophic and clearwater and the manipulation did not change the supply of phosphorus, and thus there were only minor changes in lake chemistry and biology.

40|$|We {{assembled}} {{data from}} a global network of automated lake observatories to test hypotheses regarding the drivers of ecosystem metabolism. We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) {{for up to a}} full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0. 1 to 5. 0 mg O 2 L− 1 d− 1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5 % to 85 % of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0. 017 to 2. 1 mg O 2 L− 1 d− 1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.
