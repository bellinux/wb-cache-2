Selke assigned Plante to the Buffalo Bisons of the AHL so fans in the United States would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> Plante was instantly successful; Fred Hunt, {{the general manager of}} the Bisons, told Kenny Reardon, Montreal's recruiting manager, that, [...] "he's [...] the biggest attraction since the good old days of Terry Sawchuk." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} the {{animated}} television series Rocko's Modern Life, Phineas and Ferb co-founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes that they wrote. Among these were actions sequences and chase scenes. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose Perry to execute it.

500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description {{of his relationship with}} Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

Desperate {{for a place to}} live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off. A furious mob goes on to chase after Simpson, as the Griffins look on, with Peter, wearing a guilty disappointed look, indifferently declaring, [...] "I guess he did do it." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the changes in the}} game's engine, the developers decided to improve the artificial intelligence to give each enemy a distinct behavior. According to Matt Toschlog, president of Outrage Entertainment and lead programmer of Descent 3, [...] "It's very rewarding for the player to meet a new enemy, <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> learn his quirks, and figure out the best way to kill him. It's great when a game requires both thinking and quick reactions". Originally, the developers planned to add weather effects that would disorient the player's ship during gameplay, but this feature was ultimately not implemented due to time and technology constraints. Multiplayer games were heavily tested to ensure their network stability and support IPX, TCP, and DirectPlay. The actual development of the game took 31 months to complete, with the developers describing it as both a joyful and painful process due to in part of the almost nonexistent management and the rapidly evolving technology at the time.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E

And he always loved to tell a good joke. Being in his presence was like sitting with grace and majesty at the same time. He will always be my hero. His life was a gift to us all." ...|$|E

We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to really <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> when my career stopped.

[...] After a five-day trial, they were convicted of conspiracy to steal the animal. Horne, Jim O'Donnell, Mel Broughton, and Jim Buckner were fined £500, and Horne and Broughton were given an additional six-month suspended sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned [...] "No Money in This Deal", was {{recorded}} on January 19, and appeared in February on Starday Records, beginning the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. [...] "Pappy" [...] Daily. The song was actually cut in Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes' {{living room and}} produced by Starnes. Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont around this time. [...] Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname [...] "possum" [...] while working there: [...] "One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. [...] For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. [...] He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum." [...] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. [...] In later years, Jones would have little good {{to say about the}} music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that [...] "it was a terrible sound. [...] We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. [...] You could hear the trucks. [...] We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again." [...] Jones' first hit came with [...] "Why Baby Why" [...] in 1955. [...] That same year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. [...] "I didn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> that well," [...] Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. [...] "He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. [...] Nobody seemed to get around him much any length of time to talk to him." [...] Jones would, however, remain a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash. [...] Jones was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.|$|E
