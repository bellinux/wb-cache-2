Kennedy's death certificate, signed by his personal physician Dr. George Burkley, locates the bullet at the third thoracic vertebra—which some claim was too low to have exited his throat. Moreover, the bullet traveled downward, as the shooter was in a sixth floor window of the Book Depository building. The autopsy <b>descriptive</b> <b>sheet</b> displays a diagram of the President's body with the same low placement at the third thoracic vertebra.

40|$|Knowledge of the granites of Sumatra {{has been}} {{gathered}} mainly {{as the result}} of systematic mapping programmes conducted with the aim of identifying mineral resources and providing a geological data base for more detailed studies. Mapping programmes were conducted principally by Dutch and Indonesian geologists prior to the second world war, mainly in southern Sumatra and the Tin Islands. In the 1970 s a combined Indonesian Directorate of Mineral Resources (DMR) /British Geological Survey (BGS) project was set up to map the geology of Sumatra {{to the north of the}} Equator. On completion of this project in the mid- 1980 s geological and geochemical maps for the region were published at the scale of 1 : 250 000, together with <b>descriptive</b> <b>sheet</b> bulletins. Another useful compilation which may be refered to is the 1 : 2. 5 million scale geological map for the whole of the Indonesian Archipelago which includes Sumatra (Clarke 1990). Subsequently BGS undertook a similar but smaller project in southern Sumatra in order to upgrade geological mapping and mineral exploration programmes which were being conducted by the Indonesian Geological Research and Development Centre (GRDC) and DMR. As part of this programme a specific effort was made to investigate the granites of this region. A combined granite workshop/regional mapping programme resulted in the identification of many granite units within batholiths such as Lassi, Bungo and Garba, as well as numerous isolated plutons. Full geochemical and isotopic analyses were provided for these granites (McCourt & Cobbing 1993; McCourt et al. 1996). Gasparon & Varne (1995) have provided further...|$|E

Agroforestry systems provide indeed a shelter for the hens roaming outside. In this study 26 runs including flocks of 3, 000 organic laying hens and agroforestry systems were investigated. The goals were first to establish a typology of the runs observed and identify the advantages and limits for each type of run. Secondly the study aimed to make a <b>descriptive</b> <b>sheet</b> for each farm, including the thoughts of the farmer interviewed and figure out the features of the run with the best distribution and its type.

The result of the observations on the 26 runs showed Danish specificities like the presence of a plantation on 78 % of the cases, made of an orchard or a coppice for biomasse production and sometimes a forest of firs for Christmas trees production. No specific interest was found in between the type of run including orchard or coppice and the run with the best distribution seem to gather both of the features: presence of fruit on the outdoor area in addition to a plantation of willows.

40|$|An {{important}} role for bank capital {{is that of}} a buffer against unexpected losses. As uncertainty about these losses increases, the theory predicts an increase in the optimal level of bank capital. This paper investigates this implication empirically with U. S. Commercial Banks data and finds statistically significant and robust evidence supporting it. A counterfactual experiment suggests that a decline in uncertainty to the lowest level measured in the sample generates an average reduction in bank capital ratios of slightly over 1 percentage point. However, I also find suggestive evidence that the intensity of this precautionary motive is stronger during recessions. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that the effectiveness of countercyclical capital requirements during bad times will be undermined by banks desire to hold more capital in response to increased uncertainty.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to find the {{barriers}} of benchmarking use in independent full-service restaurants in South Africa. The global restaurant industry entities operate in a highly competitive environment, and restaurateurs should have a visible ad¬vantage over competitors. A competitive advantage can be achieved only if the quality standards in terms of food and beverage products, service quality, relevant technology and price are comparable to the industry leaders. This study has deployed a descriptive, quantitative research design on the basis of a relatively large sample of restaurateurs. The data was collected through the SurveyMonkey website using a standardised questionnaire The questionnaire was mailed to 2699 restaurateurs, and 109 respondents returned fully completed answer <b>sheets.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. The main findings were as follows: 43 % of respondents had never done benchmarking; only 5. 5 % respondents considered themselves as highly knowledgeable about benchmarking; respondents thought that the most significant barriers to benchmarking were difficulties with obtaining exemplar (benchmarking partner) best-practice information and adapting the anomalous (own) practices to derive a benefit from best practices.

He had expected that, somehow, everything would be quite different--it seemed such a prodigious time since he went away. All silent and all damned, he reflected, as he looked at them. Mr. Scogan's pipe still wheezed; that was the only sound. Henry Wimbush was still deep in his account books; he had just made the discovery that Sir Ferdinando was in the habit of eating oysters the whole summer through, regardless of the absence of the justifying R. Gombauld, in horn-rimmed spectacles, was reading. Jenny was mysteriously scribbling in her red notebook. And, seated in her favourite arm-chair at the corner of the hearth, Priscilla was looking through a pile of drawings. One by one she held them out at arm's length and, throwing back her mountainous orange head, looked long and attentively through half-closed eyelids. She wore a pale sea-green dress; on the slope of her mauve-powdered decolletage diamonds twinkled. An immensely long cigarette-holder projected at an angle from her face. Diamonds were embedded in her high-piled coiffure; they glittered every time she moved.

40|$|Objective: Pakistan {{is ranked}} 5 th {{in the world}} in terms of having immense Tuberculosis (TB) burden. During the course of TB treatment, adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) due to anti-TB drugs are a killer problem. Therefore, the present study was conducted on 200 TB patients to explore the incidence of ADRs due to anti-TB drugs. Methods: This is a multicenter study conducted at two public healthcare institutes of Quetta city, Pakistan. Data of 200 patients was screened from the official records and evaluated to identify variables of interest. All necessary diagnostic tests were performed before starting the therapy and after every 2 months during the study. Data was collected through a validated information <b>sheet.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> SPSS v. 20 was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the study. In this study, most frequently reported ADR was fever (163, 84. 5 %) followed by nausea (152, 76 %) and epigastric pain (117, 58. 5 %). Interestingly, the most commonly reported ADR in literature (constipation and weight gain) were least reported in the current study. Thirty nine (19. 5 %) patients were admitted to hospital during the study because of the observed ADRs. During the study, 46 (23 %) patients were given re-challenge to ADRs and were managed by giving additional medicines with TB drug treatment regimen. One hundred and eighty three I(91. 5 %) patients from both hospitals were given a complete 6 months therapy. However, 5 (2. 5 %) patients died during the therapy and 12 (6 %) patients underwent therapy discontinuation because of unidentified reasons. Conclusion: Majority of the patients experienced ADRs and the management of most ARDs was done by therapy modifications. It was also observed during the study that some patients did not report common and clinically mild ADRs, so it is the duty of health practitioners to interrogate and investigate the patients keenly. Health practitioner should also take immediate actions to combat the ADRs and improve the patient’s quality of life.

40|$|Context: The {{differences}} in frequency of cancer among the less developed {{and the more}} developed regions continue to remain as an important problem for service planning and international action against cancers {{of the head and}} the neck. Aim: This study compares distribution of cancers of the head and the neck between two similar-sized populations from the west of Iran and Western Australia. Setting and Design: In this retrospective study, de-identified data were collected for a 10 -year period from patients diagnosed with head and the neck cancers. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the Western Australia Cancer Registries and from major hospitals in the west of Iran. Age at diagnosis, sex, and site code were included in the data <b>sheet.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> analysis was used to describe the basic features, means (±standard deviation) were reported, and tests of significance were used as appropriate. Results: In Iran, cancer of the lip, followed by cancer of the major salivary gland, and cancer of the tongue were the three most frequent types of cancers, whereas in Australia, the most frequent types of cancer were cancer of the lip followed by cancers of the tongue and the tonsil. Distribution of malignancy by site among the patients belonging to different ages indicated that cancer of the lip was the most frequent cancer in both Iran and Australia, except among the patients belonging to the age group of 60 – 74 years in Iran, where cancer of the major salivary gland had the highest frequency. Both men and women were susceptible for cancers of the head and the neck in the age range of 60 – 74 years in Iran, whereas in Australia, it was more frequent among men belonging to the age range of 45 – 59 years and in women above the age of 75 years.
