5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|The {{ramifications of}} the tsunami went beyond the {{immediate}} impact to the lives and infrastructure of the Acehnese living on the coast. Since the disaster, the Acehnese rebel movement GAM, which had been fighting for independence against the Indonesian authorities for 29 years, has signed a peace deal (15 August 2005). The perception that the tsunami was punishment for insufficient piety in this proudly Muslim province is partly behind the increased emphasis {{on the importance of}} religion post-tsunami. This has been most obvious in the increased implementation of Sharia law, including the introduction of the controversial 'WH' or Syariah police. As homes are being built and people's basic needs are met, the people are also looking {{to improve the quality of}} education, increase tourism, and develop responsible, sustainable industry. Well-qualified <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> in high demand in Aceh.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{provided}} us with mixed results {{as to whether or}} not a person's involvement in social networking can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected, <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{wrote that}} [...] Portal 2 excels in {{teaching}} the player to solve puzzles; {{in a review}} for the New York Times, Seth Schiesel wrote, [...] "Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately {{become the most important}} science teacher those lucky students have ever had." [...] Mathematics and science teachers wrote e-mails to Valve to tell them how they had included Portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote the [...] "gamification of learning". Portal developers Joshua Weier and Yasser Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education. This {{led to the development of}} Puzzle Maker, a level editor for Portal 2 players, built from the professional tools used to develop the game. Weier and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves, but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans. Hammer, the only tool freely available before the release of the built-in level editor in 2012, was difficult for educators to learn and understand. Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy-to-learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans. The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students. This formed the basis of a new [...] "Steam for Schools" [...] initiative launched in June 2012, under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] program. , Valve estimates that over 2,500 <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> using the [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] software within their lesson plans.|$|E

2500|$|As {{education}} is a provincial concern, sex education varies across Canada. Ontario has a provincial curriculum created in 1998.

With rates of syphilis and gonorrhea rising in the province since this change, several researchers and sex <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> criticizing the current policy, most notably Lisa Trimble and Stephanie Mitelman.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the primary}} level (ISCED Level 1) {{students}} could attend private, religious or government schools. Currently, there are 7.8 {{percent of students}} enrolled at primary level in private schools as of 2007. The total enrollment of students at primary level is 105 percent in 2007. [...] The examinations at grade 3 are on district (edara) level. Though there is a push for Egyptian children to attend primary school, <b>educators</b> <b>are</b> often ill-equipped to teach them. As of 1995, a mere 7 percent of primary school teachers in Egypt had received a university degree; the remaining 93 percent only had nine years of formal education.|$|E
2500|$|Concept mapping: A {{technique}} for visualizing {{the relationships between}} different concepts. A concept map is a diagram showing the relationships between concepts. [...] Concepts are connected with labelled arrows, in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g., [...] "gives rise to", [...] "results in", [...] "is required by," [...] or [...] "contributes to". Concept mapping serves several purposes. One, which takes place via knowledge elicitation, is to represent the mental models, i.e., the cognitive map of individuals, teams and organizations. Another, which takes place by knowledge capture, is to represent the structure of knowledge gleaned from written documents. The addition of knowledge resources, e.g., diagrams, reports, other concept maps, spreadsheets, etc., to the concept nodes (attached during or after construction) {{has been found to}} significantly improve the level of meaningful learning of the concept mapper. <b>Educators</b> <b>are</b> increasingly realising the utility of such maps and have started using them in classroom.|$|E
