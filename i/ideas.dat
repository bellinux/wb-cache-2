5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's <b>ideas</b> were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar <b>ideas</b> in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E

5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted <b>ideas</b> from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own <b>ideas</b> were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider <b>ideas</b> from the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his <b>ideas</b> according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E
5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His <b>ideas</b> resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century. These <b>ideas,</b> considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation's political and social history.

Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game <b>ideas</b> as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of <b>ideas</b> that included game <b>ideas</b> for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's <b>ideas</b> on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these <b>ideas</b> are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these <b>ideas.</b> Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the first}} <b>ideas</b> leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric <b>ideas</b> like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E

50|$|Let's consider, {{for further}} explanation, an example used by Bolzano.

5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental <b>ideas</b> or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (<b>ideas</b> or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to <b>ideas</b> must mean that such <b>ideas</b> are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

In this area, one of the popular methods for coping with large amounts of data is duplicate de- tection. With our research, we answer a question if there is room to introduce more relationship types and in what degree would this change affect the amount of <b>idea</b> metadata and its diversity. Furthermore, based on hierarchical dependencies between <b>idea</b> relationships and relationship transitivity we propose a number of methods for dataset summarization. To evaluate our hypotheses we annotate <b>idea</b> datasets with new relationships using the contemporary methods of <b>Idea</b> Management Systems to detect <b>idea</b> similarity. Having datasets with relationship annotations at our disposal, we determine if <b>idea</b> features not related to <b>idea</b> topic (e. g. innovation size) have any relation to how annotators perceive types of <b>idea</b> similarity or dissimilarity...|$|R
