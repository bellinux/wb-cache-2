5|$|The American {{troops had}} signed up to capture Louisbourg, and {{expected}} to go home after siege ended. The British government, who had believed that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no plans to send British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it become evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise {{the morale of the}} troops. His first speech to the troops had little effect, and some troops were close to mutiny. In a second speech Shirley promised to send <b>home</b> <b>more</b> troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{bought and}} renovated a €4million house in Killiney outside Dublin during 2002–2003, {{where they were}} living mostly for their children's primary education. Their daughter, Sian had leukaemia at age 7, which {{required}} three years of treatment, in Dublin and in California. After discussion with the family, U2 went forward with its 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour, but with changed scheduling, reduced dates, and a long postponement of the final leg, all to enable Edge to get <b>home</b> <b>more</b> often. Bono later termed Steinberg a heroine for having to take up more of the parental burden and said that without her, the tour would never have taken place at all. After their daughter was declared free of leukaemia, Steinberg and The Edge learned that she was dyslexic and relocated to New York {{so that she could}} attend a special learning centre there.|$|E

Lombard was able to raise over $2 million ($35 million in 2016) in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was anxious to reach <b>home</b> <b>more</b> quickly and wanted to fly by a scheduled airline. Her mother and Winkler were both afraid of flying and insisted they follow their original travel plans. Lombard suggested they flip a coin; they agreed and Lombard won the toss.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1889 the club moved to its {{permanent}} home ever since, Molineux, in the Whitmore Reans area of the city. The stadium name originates from the Molineux House built in the area by Benjamin Molineux, a local merchant, in the 18th century and whose grounds were later developed to include numerous public leisure facilities. When the Northampton Brewery Company purchased these grounds in 1889, they rented their use to the city's football club, who were seeking to find a <b>home</b> <b>more</b> befitting a Football League member. After renovating the site, the first ever official game was staged on 7 September 1889 before a crowd of 4,000.

25|$|By December 2009, no {{takeover}} {{had happened}} and the current owners held creditors meetings {{to try to get}} the banks to give them more time to raise vital funds. Results on the pitch improved slightly with November finishing with two wins, one draw and one defeat, but Zola's men were given a swift reminder of the up hill battle they faced to survive in the Premier League at the hands of Manchester United, as they lost 4–0 at <b>home.</b> <b>More</b> bad luck followed with the loss of top goal scorer Carlton Cole for two months to injury along with young Zavon Hines with a knee injury, leaving Zola over the Christmas break with just Franco and Frank Nouble up front. West Ham also lost Valon Behrami for most of December along with facing a scare with goalkeeper Robert Green, who went off early during the Manchester United game.

25|$|The {{use of the}} Ukrainian {{language}} is increasing after {{a long period of}} decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic Ukrainians worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine (77.8% of the total population), the Ukrainian {{language is}} prevalent only in western and central Ukraine. In Kiev, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking. The shift is believed to be caused, largely, by an influx of the rural population and migrants from the western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kievans' turning to use the language they speak at <b>home</b> <b>more</b> widely in everyday matters. Public signs and announcements in Kiev are in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language of the urban population. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 87.8% people living in Ukraine communicate in Ukrainian.|$|E
25|$|Americans {{have the}} highest average {{household}} income among OECD nations, and in 2010 had the fourth highest median household income, down from second highest in 2007. According to one analysis middle class incomes in the United States fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen behind by 2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the gap in recent years. According to the Census Bureau, inflation-adjusted household income reached an all-time high of $59,039 in 2016, with record gains in recent years. Income inequality is also at record highs, with the top fifth of earners taking <b>home</b> <b>more</b> than 50% of all overall income. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, wealth inequality is at record highs as well; the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. The Boston Consulting Group posited in June 2017 report that 1% of the Americans will control 70% of country's wealth by 2021.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote {{circular}} migration. Modern forms of transport and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced the time and money necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return <b>home</b> <b>more</b> frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are especially important to the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, the best way to get jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of circular migration. With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} {{stagnant}} growth, in 2016, {{according to the}} Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking <b>home</b> <b>more</b> {{than half of all}} overall income. There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s. However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance. [...] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality, leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations. OECD, May 2014. Retrieved May 1, 2014. The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers, The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.|$|E
500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family.

One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer.
