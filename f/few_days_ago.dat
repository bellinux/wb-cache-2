5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E

25|$|Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) visits Stan with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) {{as he is}} {{in desperate}} need of money. Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, expecting to see Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago.</b> A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree to stick it out for three weeks. After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly. He is rescued by his great-grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) who {{the rest of the family}} believed was still serving in Afghanistan. It is revealed Lee has been staying with Stan for a week. After Mick believes Stan has been wetting the bed, a furious Stan demands to be taken back home. Whilst there, he is visited by Dean, who is in trouble with the law for handling stolen goods. When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E

500|$|The boy was curious, {{he was a}} big Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking the name of the film. The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday!

500|$|On 11 June 1847, {{the young}} prince {{was playing in}} the library of the palace when he {{experienced}} a series of strong convulsions and died, not quite {{two and a half years}} old. His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy, as did his father. The grief of PedroII and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened Leopoldina. The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress Amélia, dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: [...] "With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month; and a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me." ...|$|E

Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. might have left a little for the Catholics. I don't like to see a man take it all, even if he is a missionary."
