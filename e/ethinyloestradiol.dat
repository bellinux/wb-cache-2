40|$|BACKGROUND—Turner {{syndrome}} {{accounts for}} 15 - 20 % of childhood usage of growth hormone (GH) in the UK but final height benefit remains uncertain. The most effective strategy for oestrogen replacement is also unclear.  METHODS—Fifty eight girls who, at start of treatment, were of mean age 9. 1 years and projected final height 142. 2 cm were randomised to receive in year 1, either low dose <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> 50 - 75 ng/kg/day, GH 28 IU/m 2 surface area/week as a daily injection, {{or a combination}} of <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> and GH. After the first year, the <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> treated girls received combination treatment. After two years, girls aged over 12 years were given escalating <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> to promote pubertal development.  RESULTS—Near final height was available for 49 girls at age 16. 5 years, 146. 8 cm, representing a gain of 4. 6 cm, range − 7. 9 to + 11. 7 cm. Twelve of the 49 girls gaining 7. 5 cm or more were less than 13 years at the start and had received GH for at least four years. Height gain was correlated with greater initial height deficit. Fifteen girls (31 %) reached 150 cm or more compared to a predicted 10 %. Early supplementation with <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> provided no final height advantage.  CONCLUSIONS—Final height gain was modest at 4. 6 cm. Younger, shorter girls gained greatest height advantage from GH. Low dosage <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> before planned induction of puberty was not beneficial. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{previous}} chlorpromazine pharmacokinetic studies {{a dramatic}} elevation in blood plasma levels of this drug was observed when taken {{in combination with}} oral contraceptives. Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain this observation. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether oral contraceptives such as <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> and progesterone enhance the absorption of chlorpromazine by means of inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and if this effect is mainly due to <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> or progesterone or their combination. The Caco- 2 cell line was used as an in vitro model to study the effects of these compounds on the transport of chlorpromazine. Both apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and basolateral to apical (BL-AP) transport studies were done on chlorpromazine in combination with different compounds. <b>Ethinyloestradiol</b> enhanced the AP-BL cumulative transport of chlorpromazine by 11. 5 % compared to the control group, which was also statistically significantly higher than the effect caused by progesterone (0. 8 %). A combination of these two steroidal hormones enhanced the cumulative transport of chlorpromazine by only 2. 0 % compared to the control group. This indicates the possible existence of separate drugbinding sites for these two hormones and chlorpromazine on P-gp. The drug-binding site (or receptor) for progesterone probably interacts allosterically with the binding site for <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> and thereby decreasing its transport enhancing effects on chlorpromazine...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Oestrogens {{are used}} to inhibit growth in girls with constitutionally tall stature. We studied the changes in {{different}} hormones that accompany such therapy. Subjects and methods: In this longitudinal study we examined the levels of total insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), free thyroxine (FT 4), thyrotrophin (TSH), testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), cortisol and prolactin in two groups of girls receiving <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> at a dose of either 0. 1 mg daily (group A, n = 22) or 0. 2 mg daily (group B, n = 36). Hormonal measurements were performed at start of therapy and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: In both groups the levels of IGF-I, testosterone and DHEA-S were reduced while the concentrations of cortisol and prolactin were increased. The pituitary–thyroid axis was not signifi-cantly affected by this therapy. The girls receiving 0. 2 mg <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> daily had lower IGF-I levels after 12 months of therapy and had higher serum prolactin concentrations than the girls treated with 0. 1 mg daily. The reduction in predicted height and the advancement in bone age were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Therapy with pharmacological doses of <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> changes the levels of several hormones including IGF-I, testosterone, DHEA-S, prolactin and cortisol but {{the role of the}} respective changes in the inhibition of growth is not clear.

The effect of these preparations on corneal curvature, lacrimal fluid volume and protein composition and directly on corneal lens tolerance was monitored in a group of 23 volunteer patients. The progestogen was found to produce a significant (P≥ 0. 05) decrease in tear volume as measured by a 3 minute Schirmer test. A smaller volume reduction was observed with <b>ethinyloestradiol.</b> A normal cornea appears unaffected, within the measurement limits available, by the use of either hormone. However, {{in the presence of a}} corneal lens, oestrogen was found to induce substantial corneal steepening, indicative of tissue oedema, during the initial 2 - 3 weeks of medication. Progestogen occasionally produced a similar effect, which could recur with either hormone shortly after the end of the treatment period. A new method of acrylamide gel electrophoresis was developed for examination of the protein concentration and composition of lacrimal fluid. This allowed much greater resolution of microquantities of unconcentrated fluid than anything previously reported.

The reports concerned preparations in which norethisterone acetate in doses of 1. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, or 4. 0 mg was combined with 50 microgram of <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> and those in which levonorgestrel in doses of 150 or 250 microgram was combined with 30 microgram of <b>ethinyloestradiol.</b> Observed and expected numbers of reports were compared, using retail pharmacy purchase figures as a measure of the use of different preparations. There was a significant positive association between the dose of norethisterone acetate and deaths from stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD); this association was also found for all cases of these two conditions, fatal plus non-fatal. There were no associations of dose of norethisterone acetate with hypertension or venous thrombosis. The higher dose of levonorgestrel was associated with a possible excess of deaths, non-venous plus venous, and an excess of strokes. There was no association between dose of levonorgestrel and hypertension or venous thrombosis. The reports were also used to assess the relative safety of 30 -microgram and 50 -microgram oestrogen preparations. Those with 30 microgram of oestrogen were associated with significantly fewer reports of death and IHD (both fatal, and fatal plus non-fatal) than those with 50 microgram of oestrogen. In view of the large-scale move towards preparations with progressively lower oestrogen doses, there are no grounds for major changes in oral contraceptive practice.

Of the many stimuli used {{in an attempt to}} raise TSH levels in normal adult subjects only three—synthetic thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, <b>ethinyloestradiol,</b> and carbimazole plus iodides—have been effective. The major clinical application of the TSH immunoassay lies in the diagnosis of minor degrees of hypothyroidism. An impaired response of serum TSH to synthetic thyrotrophin-releasing hormone should also help in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism affecting TSH production...|$|E
40|$|While both {{endocrine}} {{therapy and}} chemotherapy are of proven {{value in the}} treatment of advanced breast cancer, the effects of combining these two methods or applying them consecutively have been relatively disappointing. This may be due to endocrine therapy suppressing cell division, in hormone-dependent tumors, whereas chemotherapy acts mainly on active-dividing cells. A trial protocol has therefore been devised which seeks to exploit the properties of both types of therapy. Oestrogen suppression is first obtained by aminoglutethimide (Orimeten) plus hydrocortisone; after 2 weeks, <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> is given to induce cell division and followed 24 h later by a combination of 3 cytotoxic agents given intravenously. This pattern of therapy, repeated at regular intervals, appears to be producing favorable clinical results. A phase-III study is being started among patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the proton pump {{inhibitor}} lansoprazole on the bioavailability of a low-dose oral contraceptive (OC), containing 0. 03 mg <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> (EE) and 0. 15 mg levonorgestrel (LNG), were investigated. Twenty-four healthy females (aged 19 - 35 years; weight 60. 6 +/- 7. 1 kg) participated in a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized two-way cross-over study. All subjects received the OC over 2 full menstrual cycles from day 1 to day 21 separated by a drug-free interval of 7 days. Lansoprazole (60 mg day- 1) or placebo was coadministered for 3 weeks each. Plasma concentrations of EE and LNG were determined by GC-MS. The 90 % confidence intervals for ratios of Cmax and AUC after log transformation of both EE and LNG ranged between 91 and 111 %, indicating that lansoprazole {{did not affect the}} bioavailability of EE and LNG...|$|E
40|$|The {{day to day}} {{variation}} {{and the effects of}} oestrogen on the urinary excretion of thyroxine (T- 4) were studied in euthyroid women and men. Serial urinary T- 4 values over a period of 28 consecutive days were found to lie within relatively narrow limits except for a transient increase during menstruation in women. During oestrogen therapy urinary T- 4 was unchanged, but an appreciable rise was seen after stopping oral ovulation inhibitors in women. A similar effect was seen in men after three days' treatment with 20 μg/day of <b>ethinyloestradiol.</b> The increased urinary T- 4 excretion on oestrogen withdrawal reached a maximum in one to three days. This response contrasted with that produced by phenytoin, a drug known to bind to thyroxine binding globulin, and which resulted in increased urinary T- 4 excretion during the period that it was being administered...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of intersex fish is {{widespread in the}} rivers of England and Wales and {{is believed to be}} strongly linked to their exposure to steroid oestrogens from sewage treatment plants. A national concentration-based risk assessment has been carried out. Predictions of exposure using the LF 2000 -WQX model have been made for the inland waters of England and Wales. It incorporates spatial and physical data for > 2, 000 STPs serving over 29 million people. The mean and 90 th percentile concentrations of oestradiol (E 2), oestrone and <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> and their associated endocrine disruption risk were predicted for 21, 452 km of river. Mean concentrations of the combined steroids were compared with a risk classifications based on a review of ecotoxicology studies. 61 % of the river length modelled in England and Wales was predicted to be not ‘at risk’ from endocrine disruption (10 ng/L E 2 eqv) ...|$|E
40|$|PRL {{levels were}} {{evaluated}} during long-term treatment with cyproterone acetate 100 mg and <b>ethinyloestradiol</b> 100 micrograms/day orally or depot-oestrogens in 214 male-to-female transsexuals. PRL levels increased above normal in all subjects (normal less than 300 mU/l). In 46 (21. 4 %) subjects PRL levels rose to greater than 1000 mU/l. The incidence of PRL levels greater than 1000 mU/l was 3. 7 - 7. 2 % per treatment year. Grossly elevated PRL levels {{were associated with}} high doses of oestrogens (P less than 0. 05) and advanced age {{at the start of}} treatment (P less than 0. 05). In 23 subjects PRL levels greater than 1000 mU/l decreased by more than 50 % spontaneously (n = 5) or after dose reduction (n = 18). In five of the subgroup of 15 subjects with persistent PRL levels greater than 1000 mU/l enlargement of the pituitary gland was shown by CT-scanning. These data suggest that the lowest possible oestrogen dose and lifelong follow-up of hormone-treated male-to-female transsexuals is essentia...|$|E
40|$|Oestrogens have a {{preventive}} effect on bone loss in post-menopausal women; however, {{little is known}} about their mechanism of action. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the changes in somatomedins (SM) and growth hormone (GH) concentrations in serum in post-menopausal women after 3 weeks of substitution with 20 micrograms <b>ethinyloestradiol.</b> A significant decrease was observed in the mean serum levels of SM, measured by bioassay (0. 66 +/- 0. 07 vs 0. 38 +/- 0. 07, P less than 0. 01), radioimmunoassay (0. 62 +/- 0. 08 vs 0. 34 +/- 0. 03, P less than 0. 01) and radioreceptorassay (1. 14 +/- 0. 11 vs 0. 90 +/- 0. 09, P less than 0. 01). The mean serum GH concentration increased (9. 4 +/- 3. 2 vs 16. 5 +/- 4. 6, P less than 0. 01). A positive role of SM and GH in the changes of bone metabolism after oestrogen substitution in post-menopausal women is discusse...|$|E
