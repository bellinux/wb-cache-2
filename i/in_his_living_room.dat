5|$|Conran {{spent four}} years making {{a black and white}} teaser with a bluescreen set up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and using a Macintosh IIci. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so {{impressed}} that he spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested in Sky Captain, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.|$|E
5|$|James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) {{discuss their}} new relationship, and kiss passionately on Donna's sofa. Elsewhere, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), still {{mourning}} Laura's death, dances <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> sobbing {{and holding a}} portrait of Laura as he does so. He breaks open the picture's frame, cutting his hands, as his wife Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) screams at him to stop.|$|E
50|$|However {{the context}} of the French Leçons de ténèbres was often private performance. Delalande's 15-year-old {{daughter}} sang for Louis XIV first <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and then <b>in</b> chapel, becoming the praise of all Paris. Philidor's catalogue indicates that Delalande's three surviving virtuoso solo Leçons de ténèbres were composed for such occasions.|$|R

After she again interrupts him, Mahmud leaves the home.|$|E
5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet him in the past, but arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E
25|$|On his website, Green {{has talked}} about the {{substantial}} costs of continuing the online show and that The Channel may be gone in mid-2011 {{if it is not}} profitable by then. In 2011, Green ended the subscription service on his website and stated that his live show is on hiatus.

25|$|On January 26, 2009, the {{preliminary}} hearing was postponed until March 17, to give McInerney's lawyers time to appeal Judge Riley's rejection of the December motion for discovery. On March 18, 2009, the hearing was again postponed, when William McInerney, the father of Brandon, was found dead <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> in the Silver Strand area near Oxnard after he sustained an accidental head injury in a fall. Judge Riley granted Brandon McInerney permission to leave the juvenile detention facility and attend his father's funeral.|$|E

A particular favorite was Walker, Texas Ranger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of all this, Lou Pearlman in 1992 placed {{an ad in the}} Orlando Sentinel to compose a vocal group. McLean, who was the first to {{audition}} for Pearlman <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> became the group's first member. In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee. Eventually, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations. Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date. Pearlman decided to call them Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.|$|E

500|$|The {{musical and}} stylistic {{elements}} of The White Stripes were grounded and rooted in blues, garage rock, and early punk [...] They emerged from Detroit's active garage rock revival {{scene of the}} late 1990s and early 2000s. Their contemporaries included bands such as The Von Bondies, The Dirtbombs, The Detroit Cobras, and other bands that Jack included on a compilation album called Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit, which was recorded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Jerry is {{shopping}} for clothes with Elaine, {{he finds a}} suede jacket that he likes.

500|$|Roy's wife Ronnie {{attempts}} {{to hide the}} sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by {{what has happened to}} him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devils Tower <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> with his family deserting him. Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story [...] "Dulcie and Decorum" [...] (1955) by Damon Knight.|$|E
5000|$|The Franeker Planetarium {{built by}} a wool carder named Eise Eisinga <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>in</b> the small city of Franeker in Friesland, is in fact an orrery.

It is driven by a pendulum clock, which has 9 weights or ponds. The planets move around the model in real time.|$|R
5000|$|Solis {{has stated}} {{he is the}} result of [...] "basically growing up around a gang-infested area with lots of negativity." [...] He turned to skateboarding as an escape, and his parents let him build a halfpipe in the backyard. Solis would [...] "put Slayer on the radio superloud" [...] and {{practice}} tricks with friends. When he was fifteen he started his first band, a Ramones cover group called Endless Vacation, which played shows <b>in</b> <b>his</b> parents' <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> They also performed shows for donations to repair the halfpipe.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} as {{an excerpt from the}} video diary of Elton Pope (Marc Warren), a young man who is describing his encounters with the Doctor. [...] Elton's on-camera narration forms a present-day frame story to a series of flashbacks related to the Doctor. Elton recalls a chance meeting with the Doctor and remembers having seen the same man as a child <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> one night. On the internet he discovers others, including Ursula Blake (Shirley Henderson), who have also reported similar experiences with the Doctor. Elton and Ursula form a group known as LINDA, the [...] "London Investigation [...] 'N' [...] Detective Agency". They are joined by three other people: Bridget (Moya Brady), Bliss (Kathryn Drysdale), and Mr Skinner (Simon Greenall). LINDA meets in a library basement to discuss their experiences, but soon their meetings become more social in nature.|$|E
500|$|The party {{recruited}} star candidates, including Calgary alderman George Ho Lem {{and former}} Calgary Stampeder star Don Luzzi (Edmonton alderman and future mayor Cec Purves {{was defeated in}} his bid to win the Social Credit nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona from Strathcona Centre incumbent Joseph Donovan Ross), but was handicapped in these efforts by Strom's unwillingness to offer cabinet posts or other incentives to potential new candidates. [...] Strom's lack of personal charisma was also a liability: tellingly, of the large budget recommended by the central committee, only $72,000 was recommended for use on television advertising, where Strom did not shine. [...] The party tried to revitalize the Premier's image through publicity movies, though efforts were mixed. [...] In one, which was pulled after a single showing, Strom appeared scowling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> urging Albertans to lower their expectations of government. [...] Another, produced by Tommy Banks and showing Strom {{in a variety of}} settings talking about the province's changing face, was more successful.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> {{and began}} {{assembling}} the tools {{he would need to}} create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of Formalyn's account, the rotund Pyecraft usually annoys him, with his boring stories and particularly about his obesity troubles. Eventually, Formalyn brings an occult weight-loss recipe of his Hindustani great-grandmother, and Pyecraft tries it for some time. Then, Pyecraft telegraphs Formalyn at the club, calling him to Pyecraft's house in Bloomsbury, where the housekeeper tells him that Pyecraft has been cloistered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>living</b> <b>room</b> for the last twenty-four hours. There, he is found, as rounded as ever, floating helplessly in the air, against the ceiling. They conclude that the recipe has literally reduced his weight, not his fatness.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York in 2001, Posen {{set up an}} atelier <b>in</b> <b>his</b> parents' <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> while {{they gave him a}} USD$15 allowance. In October of the same year, he was chosen to present a capsule collection as part of GenArt's Fresh Faces in Fashion New York 2001. He received a grant for $20,000.

[...] It was {{the brainchild of}} Wasow and Community Connect’s CEO Benjamin Sun. Launched in 1999, it was a relative latecomer to social media sites, with three already in existence targeting people of color. Benjamin Sun would also launch AsianAve and MiGente.com.|$|R
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E
500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} naked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> {{and ordered}} two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old {{into his bedroom}} along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family {{back into the living}} room and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "lo-fi" [...] Mwng was {{recorded}} over {{two weeks in}} late 1999, and—in contrast with the [...] "excessive expense" [...] of Guerilla—cost just [...] to make. The band chose Gorwel Owen as co-producer, having previously worked with him on their first two albums, 1996's Fuzzy Logic and 1997's Radiator. The majority of Mwng {{was recorded}} [...] with Owen at Ofn Studios in Llanfaelog, Wales. According to Rhys, the band had to play in separate rooms to avoid the sound of one instrument bleeding onto the track of another during recording due to Ofn's small size. [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] and [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] were recorded at Famous Studios in Cardiff, and were engineered by Greg Haver, while [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] was recorded at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, and was engineered by Michael Brennan, Jr. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] was recorded and engineered by keyboardist Cian Ciaran <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Overdubs for all songs were added at Ofn with Owen, who also mixed the album at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. Songs were recorded almost entirely live, with the band wanting to make a [...] "really immediate record" [...] as a reaction against the drawn out recording sessions for Guerilla and 1997's Radiator, which had taken several months and proved frustrating for the group. The version of [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] that appears on the album is the original demo, with [...] Rhys on drums. The band felt that, although the demo did not sound very professional, there was a warmth to it that {{would be impossible to}} recreate were the group to record the song again. The album's title translates into English as [...] "Mane". According to Rhys, the band did not have the mane of a particular animal in mind, but felt it could be [...] "an extension of a Super Furry Animal".|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter notices a {{painting}} of a ship <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mother-in-law's <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and questions whether or not he can change the channel. Lois goes on to instruct Peter {{that it is not a}} television, with Barbara interrupting and telling him it is actually the television channel PBS. Peter then interjects his hatred of PBS, after viewing a nine-part series on traffic signs by director and producer Ken Burns, the fourth of which on the yield sign.
