5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around the aircraft {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in the aircraft virtual model. The position of the aircraft <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> or factory is not known precisely; the cobot needs to detect the aircraft in order to know its position and orientation relative to the aircraft. To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, either with the laser data from its laser range finders, or with image data from its cameras.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{opened one}} of the first {{commercial}} airports in the world, and the first municipal airport in the United States, in 1908. Originally on a polo field on Loudon Road, it moved to Westerlo Island in 1909 and remained there until 1928. The Albany Municipal Airport—jointly owned by the city and county—was moved to its current location in Colonie in 1928. In 1960, the mayor sold the city's stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to the county, citing budget issues. It was known from then on as Albany County Airport until a massive upgrade and modernization project between 1996 and 1998, when it was rechristened Albany International Airport. By 1916 Albany's northern and southern borders reached their modern courses; Westerlo Island, to the south, became the second-to-last annexation, which occurred in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Before Joy struck Australia, {{residents}} {{evacuated from}} resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres {{on the mainland}} and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter {{in advance of the}} storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000travellers, many of whom spent Christmas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.|$|E

Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip.

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> or the factory, {{allows the}} robot to move {{close to the}} aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey go {{on holiday}} to Greece {{together}} and Lewis suggests they move there and open a hotel. Audrey agrees {{and gets a}} £100,000 loan towards {{the purchase of the}} hotel. Lewis, needing money of his own, decides to steal from Peter Barlow's betting shop with fraudulently franked betting slips. He begins flirting with Deirdre Barlow, an employee at the betting shop. Lewis sends Deirdre out of the shop to get a corkscrew so they can share a bottle of wine. He places his fraudulent betting slips in the till and when Deirdre returns, he kisses her to distract her. Lewis slips out of Audrey's farewell party to collect his money and he leaves for the airport. Peter discovers Lewis has stolen from him and Audrey is devastated by his disappearance.

5|$|The U.S. {{launched}} its invasion of Panama on December 20, 1989. Although {{the killing of}} the Marine was the ostensible reason for the invasion, the operation had been planned for months before his death. The move was the largest military action by the U.S. since the Vietnam War, and included more than 27,000 soldiers, as well as 300 aircraft. The Bush administration considered lighter assaults using fewer troops, but decided against them. The U.S. forces targeted Noriega's personal private vehicles. Several slums in the middle of Panama City were destroyed in the U.S. bombing campaign. The day after the invasion, Noriega's deputy Colonel Luis del Cid retreated with some soldiers to the mountains outside David City, after laying mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> Though this was part of a contingency plan for the invasion, del Cid quickly decided that the Panamanian military was {{not in a position to}} fight a guerrilla war against the U.S., and negotiated a surrender. The number of U.S. soldiers that were killed in the operation was between 23 and 60; 300 soldiers were injured. Casualties among the Panamanian forces were much higher; between 300 and 845. A large number of civilians were killed in the invasion: the precise figure is a matter of debate. The U.S. government reported 250 civilian deaths; other observers estimated 3,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E
