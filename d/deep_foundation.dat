50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>deep</b> <b>foundations</b> {{including}} piles, drilled shafts, caissons, piers, and earth stabilized columns. Large buildings such as skyscrapers typically require <b>deep</b> <b>foundations.</b> For example, the Jin Mao Tower in China uses tubular steel piles about 1m (3.3 feet) driven {{to a depth of}} 83.5m (274 feet) to support its weight.|$|R
25|$|H-Piles are {{structural}} beams {{that are}} driven {{in the ground}} for <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> application. They can be easily cut off or joined by welding or mechanical drive-fit splicers. If the pile is driven into a soil with low pH value, {{then there is a}} risk of corrosion, coal-tar epoxy or cathodic protection can be applied to slow or eliminate the corrosion process. It is common to allow for an amount of corrosion in design by simply over dimensioning the cross-sectional area of the steel pile. In this way the corrosion process can be prolonged up to 50 years.|$|E

The pontoons and the cable-stayed bridge are built in concrete, with the main span being supported with 48 cables.

From there and for , the roadwall has a 5.7 percent gradient on a viaduct anchored to the pontoon bridge.|$|E
500|$|Around 1997 and 1998, {{the idea}} to start {{development}} on the temple, by beginning the stone carving, had been requested. However, this idea was denied by Pramukh Swami Maharaj who believed that the construction should only start after the land was acquired. The initial work done on the site was on the foundation. Due to the soft river bank, the site wasn't considered ideal for construction. As a result, a <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> was imperative.

500|$|The larger north {{building}} was built without <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> trenches, but was nevertheless a solid, well-built flint and mortar construction. The building had [...] "substantial {{time and money}} spent on it" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the principal archaeologist. The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose, and the internal corners were decorated with limestone blocks set as quoins. Seashells were recovered, with a distribution suggesting that they were once {{part of the fabric of}} the building as galleting (strengthening for the mortar). [...] There were entrances in the west and northeast walls, and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls. The floor was compacted soil, and the original roof material is unknown, but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and Flemish pantiles of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher-status appearance. There was no internal wall at this date, but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner.|$|E
500|$|Before {{construction}} began, {{an archaeological}} dig was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} remains of Bellevue House. The land was originally purchased in 1800 by the Duke of Kent, who was based in the city in order to command British forces in North America. Subsequent British commanders took residence in the house, built 1801 and described as an [...] "almost palatial residence" [...] that hosted members of the Royal Family during visits to the colony. It was destroyed in an 1885 fire, but rebuilt. The British left in the early 20th century and the structure was demolished after it was acquired by the Nova Scotia Technical College in 1955. The site then remained a parking lot for over half a century, meaning the foundation of older structures was preserved under the asphalt. This stands {{in contrast to the}} site of the former infirmary next door, where the <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> rendered the site archaeologically insignificant. In addition to the foundation of the residence, the archaeological dig uncovered numerous small artefacts including china, cutlery and an 1860 Nova Scotia penny.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons that a {{geotechnical}} engineer would recommend a <b>deep</b> <b>foundation</b> over a shallow foundation, such as for a skyscraper. Some of the common reasons are very large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, or site constraints like property lines. There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a [...] ), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ; other deep foundations are typically put in place using excavation and drilling. The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.|$|E
