5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.|$|E
25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is {{the long history of}} cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006 Yunus, {{along with}} other members of the civil society {{including}} Professor Rehman Sobhan, Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Dr Kamal Hossain, Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Debapriya Bhattacharya, participated in a campaign for honest and clean candidates in national elections. He considered entering politics in the later part of that year. On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote an open letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star, where he asked citizens for views on his plan to float a political party to establish political goodwill, proper leadership and good governance. In the letter, he called on everyone to briefly outline how he should go about the task and how they can contribute to it. Yunus finally announced that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to launch a political party tentatively called Citizens' Power (Nagorik Shakti) on 18 February 2007.
