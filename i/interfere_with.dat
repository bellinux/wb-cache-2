5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Immunotherapy is a {{promising}} {{strategy in the}} fight against cancer, based on the mechanism of action of T cells. However tumors have developed several ways to evade this strategy. This is done by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic cascade, used by T cells to kill tumor cells. This can be done by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> molecules involved in the apoptotic cascade or by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> regulators of the apoptotic cascade or, by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> regulators of regulators of the apoptotic cascade. This interference leads to a reduced sensitivity to CTL mediated lysis or even to a complete resistance against CTL mediated lysis...|$|R

5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> blood supply, while non-physical causes <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E

Data were collected using a survey on 97 auditor responden audit firm in Indonesia. Data were analyzed by using Structural Equation Model (SEM) with program Smart PLS (Partial Least Squares). The result of five hypothesis (H 1 a, H 1 b, H 2 a, H 2 b and H 3) that have been proposed two hypothesis (H 1 a, and H 3) are accepted; there is influence of work <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> family (WIF) on job satisfaction, and there is influence of job satisfaction on turnover intentions.
