Relying on a unique survey conducted in metropolitan Detroit which allows us to <b>hold</b> the region <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the immigrant constant (Arab countries) while allowing for variation in religion (Christian versus Muslim), we investigate how Muslims qua Muslims integrate in the US relative to Christians. The data reveal that Muslim Arabs are more likely to experience disrespect, to report on media bias against them, and to fare less well in the labour market than do Arab American Christians. Moreover, the Muslim Arabs develop fewer social ties in their host country society and retain closer ties to their home country than do their Christian counterparts.

40|$|The design <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in {{free trade}} {{agreements}} (FTAs) arouses spirited lobbying campaigns that mostly escape public attention. This article {{argues that the}} domestic groups generally most favorable to FTAs differ in their preferences over rules of origin: industries with large returns to scale favor strict rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to gain scale economies in an FTA, while industries with multinational supply chains prefer lenient rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to accommodate offshore procurement. An econometric analysis <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in the North American Free Trade Agreement finds tougher rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> the higher the external trade protection and the larger the returns to scale, and more permissive rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> the greater the involvement in foreign sourcing.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{different}} preferences for brand name–country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> shaped in line with levels of conspicuous consumption tendency and to determine Turkish consumers’ preferences for brand name–country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> combinations in different product groups. The study was conducted in Eskisehir (Turkey) with a sample of 413 people chosen through convenience sampling. The study data were collected with a questionnaire and face-face-to interviews. The participants’ preferences for brand name-country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> combinations were determined separately based on four different product groups(hedonic, utilitarian, durable and non-durable). The study showed that, for all the four product groups, the participants preferred the products with a Turkish brand name and Turkey as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> most, followed by the products with a French brand name and France as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> This finding suggests that, with respect to the four product groups in the study, Turkish consumers preferred domestic products over foreign products. Also, the participants who preferred French brand name-France as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the durable product and French brand name-France as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the non-durable product were found to have highest tendency of conspicuous consumption in the corresponding product groups. In other words, as the level of conspicuous consumption increased, the participants tended to prefer French brand name-France as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the durable product and French brand name-France as the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the non-durable product...|$|R
