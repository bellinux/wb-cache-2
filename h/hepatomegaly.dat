5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, <b>hepatomegaly</b> (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal liver enzyme {{results are}} common in {{patients}} on amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, <b>hepatomegaly</b> (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).|$|E
25|$|Newborn babies {{experience}} with vomiting, acidosis, hyperammonemia, <b>hepatomegaly</b> (enlarged livers), hyperglycinemia (high glycine levels), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Later, cases of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia can occur.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{disease may}} present with signs of {{right-sided heart failure}} such as parasternal heave, jugular venous distension, <b>hepatomegaly,</b> ascites and/or {{pulmonary}} hypertension, the latter often presenting with a loud P2.|$|E
25|$|Painless <b>hepatomegaly</b> and splenomegaly: {{the size}} of the spleen can be 1500-3000 ml, as opposed to the normal size of 50-200 ml. Splenomegaly may {{decrease}} the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.|$|E
25|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} (with {{an increased}} risk of hepatocellular carcinoma) Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver, clubbing of the fingers, leuconychia, asterixis, <b>hepatomegaly,</b> palmar erythema and spider naevi. Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and ascites.|$|E
25|$|Primary biliary cholangitis (also {{known as}} primary biliary cirrhosis). The bile ducts become damaged by an {{autoimmune}} process, leading to secondary liver damage. Patients may be asymptomatic or have fatigue, pruritus, and non-jaundice skin hyperpigmentation with <b>hepatomegaly.</b> There is prominent alkaline phosphatase elevation {{as well as}} elevations in cholesterol and bilirubin and usually positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, {{patients}} with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It {{is usually not}} until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels {{are found to be}} elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, <b>hepatomegaly,</b> and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender <b>hepatomegaly</b> may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} generally include coarse or rough {{facial features}} (including a flat nasal bridge, thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (dwarfism), dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (<b>hepatomegaly)</b> or spleen (splenomegaly), hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.|$|E
25|$|Severe liver injury {{can result}} from hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated levels of bilirubin, <b>hepatomegaly</b> and fluid {{retention}} are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and hepatic VOD has lately {{been referred to as}} sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases of SOS are associated with a high mortality rate. Anticoagulants or defibrotide may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. Ursodiol has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by facilitating the flow of bile.|$|E
25|$|Dermal {{exposure}} has {{not been}} associated with systemic toxicity but anecdotal reports of allergic responses may be a sensitization to nickel and cross-reaction with copper or a skin irritation from copper. Workers exposed to high air levels of copper (resulting in an estimated intake of 200mg Cu/d) developed signs suggesting copper toxicity (e.g., elevated serum copper levels, <b>hepatomegaly).</b> However, other co-occurring exposures to pesticidal agents or in mining and smelting may contribute to these effects. Effects of copper inhalation are being thoroughly investigated by an industry-sponsored program on workplace air and worker safety. This multi-year research effort {{is expected to be}} finalized in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic <b>hepatomegaly</b> (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.|$|E

2500|$|Chronic {{exposure}} {{leads to}} common forms of respiratory failure (emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) and [...] focused hepatotoxicity (<b>hepatomegaly,</b> hepatic fibrosis). Continuous exposure can cause CNS depression including euphoria and disorientation.|$|E
2500|$|Clinically, MCADD {{or another}} fatty acid {{oxidation}} disorder is suspected in individuals who present with lethargy, seizures, coma and hypoketotic hypoglycemia, particularly if {{triggered by a}} minor illness. [...] MCADD can also present with acute liver disease and <b>hepatomegaly,</b> {{which can lead to}} a misdiagnosis of Reye syndrome. [...] In some individuals, the only manifestation of MCADD is sudden, unexplained death often preceded by a minor illness that would not usually be fatal.|$|E
2500|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} (ALD). Alcoholic {{cirrhosis}} develops for 10–20% {{of individuals who}} drink heavily {{for a decade or}} more. Alcohol seems to injure the liver by blocking the normal metabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. This injury happens through the formation of acetaldehyde from alcohol which itself is reactive, but which also leads to the accumulation of other reactive products in the liver. [...] Patients may also have concurrent alcoholic hepatitis with fever, <b>hepatomegaly,</b> jaundice, and anorexia. AST and ALT blood levels are both elevated, but at less than 300 IU/liter, with an AST:ALT ratio > 2.0, a value rarely seen in other liver diseases. In the United States, 40% of cirrhosis-related deaths are due to alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|Niemann–Pick type C {{has a wide}} {{clinical}} spectrum. Affected {{individuals may}} have {{enlargement of the spleen}} (splenomegaly) and liver (<b>hepatomegaly),</b> or enlarged spleen or liver combined (hepatosplenomegaly), but this finding may be absent in later onset cases. [...] Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth. [...] In some cases, however, enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years – or not at all. [...] Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time, in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann–Pick disease, Types A and B or Gaucher disease. Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2000, lawyer Rob Bilott, a partner at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, won a court order forcing DuPont to share all {{documentation}} related to PFOA. This included 110,000 files, consisting of confidential studies and reports conducted by DuPont scientists over decades. By 1993, DuPont understood that [...] "PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals" [...] and the company began to investigate alternatives. However, products manufactured with PFOA were such {{an integral part of}} DuPont's earnings, $1 billion in annual profit, they chose to continue using PFOA. Billott learned that both [...] "3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades", and by 1961 DuPont was aware of <b>hepatomegaly</b> in mice fed with PFOA.|$|E
