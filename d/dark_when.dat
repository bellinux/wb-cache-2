25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J.

Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was <b>dark</b> <b>when</b> Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire.

40|$|The {{perceived}} {{brightness of}} a grey patch {{depends on the}} surrounding context. For example, a middle grey patch appears <b>darker</b> <b>when</b> placed on a bright background and brighter when placed on a dark background. Models to explain these effects are usually based on simple low-level mechanisms such as the lateral inhibition that occurs in the retina, whereby cells in one region inhibit cells in adjacent regions. A new set of brightness illusions cannot be explained by such models. In these new illusions the brightness percept is strongly influenced by the perceptual organization of the stimuli. Simple modifi-cations of the stimuli that should have little effect on low-level mechanisms greatly alter {{the strength of the}} illusion. These effects may be ascribed to more complex mechanisms occuring later in the visual system.

25|$|Some {{animals have}} {{coloration}} {{which makes them}} highly conspicuous when outside their normal environment but highly cryptic when in it. For example, the blue morpho, a forest butterfly, has iridescent blue upper wings and a 17cm wingspan. However, because the underwings are <b>dark,</b> <b>when</b> the morpho flies through the flickering light of the forest or even out in daylight, it seems to disappear. Other forest species, especially mammals, use disruptive coloration and have spotted or striped pelage which helps break up the animal's outline. In the shade created by trees or other foliage, even large mammals such as leopards, jaguars, ocelots, and okapi are difficult to see because of such disruptive coloration.|$|E
25|$|Both {{types of}} {{melanophore}} {{are important in}} physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores, so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears <b>dark.</b> <b>When</b> the pigment is aggregated toward {{the centre of the}} cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Likewise, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.|$|E

The Confederates won the day on March 31 at Dinwiddie Court House by pushing the Union cavalry into a tight position.

25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after <b>dark</b> <b>when</b> the wasps are most docile.|$|E
25|$|Pennington's {{men of the}} 2nd New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment {{were soon}} joined by the 3rd New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in their defense of the station. According to Major Henry Edwin Tremain, the two Union regiments had to hold off a larger force of Confederate cavalry until nearly <b>dark</b> <b>when</b> {{the main body of}} Custer's {{division}} arrived to reinforce them. Historian William Marvel says the 2nd Ohio Cavalry was the second regiment to join the 2nd New York Cavalry, with the 3rd New Jersey Cavalry soon to follow so that, inconsistent with Tremain's account, three Union regiments held the depot rather than two. In any event, the Union cavalry drove the Confederates back toward Walker's artillery position. Pennington's advance regiments followed the retreating Confederates as they moved toward the Lynchburg stage road between Lynchburg and Appomattox Court House with sunset approaching.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the larvae}} reach their maximum size, {{metamorphosis}} occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at {{three to four}} years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted to the stream edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day. Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, but they tend to remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after <b>dark,</b> <b>when</b> they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, stonefly nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2. Adults overwinter up to 80cm deep into the soil of the stream bank in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period.|$|E
