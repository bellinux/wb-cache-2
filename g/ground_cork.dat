It is also fire-resistant and does not require additional fire-retardants finish.|$|E

Tragically during that war quite a number of the club members were killed in the conflict. The club, in its present-day format, was re-activated in 1923 under the presidency of John K.

The freestanding fireplace was designed to have two openings with a one-foot deep pit on the west side. Today the rear or second opening is unused. The chimney breast is of steel plate, with a plaster appliquéd, in a neutral gray finish. This surface presents an interesting texture. The fireplace is of tan brick. A second chimney leads from the gas furnace up through a chase behind the stairwell to the roof.The compact, efficient kitchen utilizes white steel cabinets with grey sliding doors and clean white formica counter tops. All are original. An obscure glass pass-through serves both the living room and the screened porch.The interior of the main house is remarkable in that a great deal of ingenuity was employed in the utilization of space, in the design of cabinets, the efficient arrangement of utilities and furniture, even in the location of permanent lighting fixtures. The integrity of the interior is extremely high, with only slight changes having taken place since its construction. For example, an interior ventilation system, based on narrow, below-window hinged wooden panels, has been permanently closed and is rarely used today, but a workable transom survives over the front door and the south plate glass windows. The former are the only non-operable features in the house.|$|R

However, it was Cork who got the most wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead.

Lancashire thought that would be a walk in the park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9.
