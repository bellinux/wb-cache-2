50|$|As metal {{technologies}} improved, these {{wrought iron}} rails were made progressively somewhat longer, {{and with a}} heavier, and therefore stronger, cross-section. By providing more metal in the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> a stronger beam was created, achieving much better strength and stiffness, and a section was created similar to the bullhead rail section still visible today. This was expensive, however, and the promoters of early railways struggled with decisions about the appropriate weight (and therefore strength, and cost) of their rails.|$|E
50|$|In late 1830s England, railway lines had a vast {{range of}} {{different}} patterns.

The supposed advantage was that, when the head became worn, the rail could be turned over and re-used.

50|$|Conditions {{that affect}} the {{installed}} stress arise through lots of activities. It is accepted that any action that disturbs the ballast, track components, geometry and rails will affect the 'Critical Rail Temperature' and cause {{the stability of the}} track to be subject to adverse thermal forces. A typical example would be when a piece of rail has been removed due to a defect, or when an Insulated block joint (IBJ) is to be replaced. In cases such as these, the stressing engineer would ensure that the old rail is measured and marked with 'TellTale' indicators on the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> at the extremities of the replaced length. The rail would then be 'Flame Cut', and the clips securing it to the sleepers/ties are removed starting at the point of the cut outward to the limit of renewal. The existing defective rail is then cut out and movement at the 'tell tales' noted for re-instatement. The stressing engineer will then calculate the 'Original Stress free temperature' of the removed section and determine how much stress, if any has been lost and needs replacing. The new rail is fitted and welded at one end. The new rail is then cut to suit the Calculated length and a stressing kit is then fitted at the end still to be welded. The kit is clamped to the rail and it pulls the gap together, leaving enough space for a second weld. Once the rail is stressed to the appropriate temperature the weld is made. After setting the weld and an appropriate cooling period of time has elapsed, the stress kit is removed.|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{failures}} of rails often {{occur at the}} rail foot, since the geometry of this zone gives rise to stress concentrations under service loads or defects during rail manufacture and installation. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of cracks at the web/foot region of a rail is analyzed numerically. Analytical models in the literature for a semi-elliptical surface crack in a finite plate assume that the geometry of the front remains semi-elliptical during the whole propagation phase and the ellipse axes do not undergo translations or rotations. Fatigue tests show {{that this is not}} the case for such cracks in rails. A predictive model for crack growth has been developed by assuming an initial small crack at one probable initiation point between the web and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> in reference to a service condition loading. SIF values have been estimated by means of the finite element method and the plastic radius correction. The results attained were compared with crack growth experimental data...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameter}} used as {{an indication}} of elastic response and quality in several railroads is the track modulus (u), which requires the determination of displacements (deflections) in the field. This paper aims to present a Device for Meas-urements of Displacements (DMD), developed to register deflections during the passage of trains without interrupting the railroad operation. To demonstrate its feasibility, the DMD was used in measurements of two sections in Estrada de Ferro Carajás (EFC), with different conditions of ballast and sleeper. The results showed that the device proved to be suitable for performing the measurement of displacements, which are subsequently used in calculating the track modulus. Additionally, in the case study it was observed that the way of loading (function of speed) relies on different mechanical responses and that measurement on the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> is more appropriate. Furthermore, it was observed that the device may likely indicate a possible defect in the wheel or in the rail. In general, {{it was found that the}} DMD can be a useful tool to help on the railroad maintenance management...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of the {{defects in}} wheel-rail contact, in railway transport, using {{vibration}} signals has been, {{in the last}} years, {{an important factor in}} the maintenance of the railroads in order to limit the impact of the vibrations both in the own installations and in its surroundings. This work is a contribution to the study and the characterization of possible present defects in movable material of the subway of Barcelona (FCMB). For it, the use of time-frequency techniques for signal analysis is proposed. In the work, signals coming from the vibration of the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> to the passage of a train are analyzed using STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) and CWT (Continue Wavelet Transform). The vibration signals, generated by the passage of a train on the railway line, are non-stationary. So, techniques based on FT (Fourier Transform) and used for stationary signals are not suitable for the analysis and the characterization of this type of signals. When applying FT to a signal, the temporary information is lost. Therefore, it does not allow establishing the exact moment in which significant alterations of the signal, coming from the defects in the wheel-rail contact, takes place. In order to solve this problem, the STFT and the CWT are used to analyze the obtained in situ nonstationary vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Rail joints {{have been}} in {{existence}} {{for a long time}} of which their design has remained primarily unchanged over this period. Rail joints are a typical example of bolted joints. Like other bolted joints, their integrity depends on the quantitative representation of the contact pressure distribution at the interface during design. In service, rail joints are subjected to complex operating stresses, and they demand high maintenance cost because they are safety critical and have the lowest service life of the components on the rail tracks. In this study, non-intrusive ultrasonic techniques have been employed to investigate the parameter relevant to their design, operation and condition monitoring. The effect of variation in plate thickness and diameter of the bearing surface of the bolt head on the contact pressure distribution at bolted interfaces under varying axial loads was investigated. While it was observed that the contact pressure at the interface increases as the applied load increases, the distance {{from the edge of the}} bolt hole at which the distribution becomes stable is independent of the applied load on the bolted joint. However, the contact pressure distribution was observed to vary with the plate thickness. Although the variation in the peak value of average contact pressure distribution in bolted joints does not depend on the plate thickness, the distance from the edge of bolt hole at which the value of the distribution becomes stable increases as the plate thickness is increased. It was revealed that the peak value of the contact pressure distribution decreases as bearing diameter of the bolt head increases, and that the distance at which the normalised average contact pressure distributions become fairly constant also increases as the bearing diameter of the bolt head increases. In the majority of the cases, the distance falls between 3 and 4 of the bolt radius from the edge of the bolt hole. It was also observed that the edge of the bolt head has a pronounced effect on the position of the peak value of the contact pressure distribution at the interface. Furthermore, a model based on a Weibull distribution has been proposed to fit the experimental data, and a good correlation was observed. Non-intrusive experimental techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and loosening of bolted joints subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas: the contact interface of bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during loosening of the joints. The results show that loosening of bolted joints can be grouped into four stages. The early stage of the loosening of bolted joints is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting- loosening of the bolted joint during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage the lower is the resistance of the bolted joint to vibration induced loosening of bolted joints. Furthermore, the rate of loosening at the bolted joint interface is not the same but increases away from the bolt hole. While the rate of loosening of bolted joints largely depends on the amplitude and the number of cycles of the applied dynamic shear load, it is independent of the frequency of the applied load. In addition, increasing the bolt torque was found to increase the loosening resistance of the bolted joint. When joints are subjected to a constant shear load in addition to the dynamic shear load, the loosening rate increase, and this rate depend on the magnitude of this constant shear load. A normal incidence pulse-echo ultrasonic technique was used to monitor de-bonding at the interface of adhesive bonded insulated lap joints and insulated block joints, subjected to a shear load induced failure. The results revealed that the insulated joint exhibited elastic behaviour before a sudden failure (rupture) of the joint. The de-bonding of adhesive/insulating layer on the web sides of IBJs was found to occur earlier than at any other parts of the joint when the applied load was only a fraction of the peak of the shear load. However, the de-bonding at the top and <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> occurred almost at the peak of the shear load. This same technique was used to monitor the degradation, and eventual failure of IBJs subjected to cyclic shear loading. The results showed that the degradation of the adhesive insulating layer has commenced, and was in progress when the joint was virtually intact and displayed elastic behaviours. The failure at the adhesive interface is indicated by a sudden change in the value of the measured reflection coefficient. After this, the failure of the joint is preceded by plastic behaviour of the joint. In addition, the change in the length of the bolts can also be monitored directly, as a complete failure at the interface of the bolted joints can be highlighted before the failure occurred. The results of this study have shown that, with further development, ultrasound can be used to monitor the condition of IBJs while in service...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{continuously}} welded <b>rail</b> track {{has some}} advantages {{and is a}} request for the traffic with elevated and high speed. Since {{there is a significant}} limitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> <b>the</b> stress state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> is <b>of</b> concern. A major condition concerns <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> being welded. <b>The</b> so called <b>rail</b> neutral temperature is regarded as a quality measure for a quasi stress free state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track. In case the temperature regulation during welding has been fulfilled, <b>the</b> thermal expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track causes stresses within acceptable limits and are not causing a buckling or cracking problem. In the other case, the zero stress line is shifted to higher tensile or to higher compressive values and the resulting stress state may cause a problem. Unfortunately, there is no reliable and applicable technique which enables <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> neutral temperature. Furthermore, there is also no technique which reliably measures the thermally induced longitudinal stress in a rail. In all cases, the total stress state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> in <b>the</b> track influences the measuring quantities. The total stress state <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> in <b>the</b> track is composed by the stress caused during <b>the</b> manufacturing process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indivi-dual <b>rail,</b> by <b>the</b> stress introduced during <b>the</b> bedding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track and finally by the stress caused by the traffic. The thermally induces stress comes additionally to all that. Mainly caused by the roller straightening process, there is a tensile stress state in the head and in <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>rail</b> which is compensated by compressive stresses in the web. The stress component along the length is significantly larger in value than the other two stress components. Hence, the stress state can be regarded as one dimensional with the dominant component along the length. Different non destructive approaches are developed and results are achieved which are in satisfying agreements with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> destructive techniques. But in case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track the situation is different. There is a three dimensional stress state in <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> used <b>rails.</b> There are compressive stresses along the length, along the width as well as along the height in <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> head until about 12 till 20 mm <b>of</b> distance from <b>the</b> running surface. And it has been found, that the stress state in the web and foot is not significantly changed by <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traffic. The non-destructive techniques, successfully applied on new rails, need to be adapted to the more complex stress situation in used rails. A new concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaluation and <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress state <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> in <b>the</b> track has to be developed, based on those results which can reliably achieved by <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> non-destructive techniques. One possibility is using <b>the</b> achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultrasonic techniques and is taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic techniques to characterize <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> structure as e. g. <b>the</b> local changes <b>of</b> structure and plastic deformation in order to enable a better correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure influence on the ultrasonic data for stress analysis. Even in well conditioned beds, substructures as culverts and underpasses have to be regarded with particular attention. On the one hand side, <b>the</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roadbed is interrupted and longitudinal (along <b>rail</b> length) gradients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> have to be taken into account. It is obvious and confirmed by experiences that <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> in <b>the</b> entrance and exit areas of tunnels and bridges as well as <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> switches face extreme conditions and stress loads. With regard to the track maintenance strategy the models describing the roadbed and soil conditions {{on the one hand and}} the traffic and thermally induced stress conditions on the other have to be modified by terms taking the total stress states and their local changes into account. Movable testing systems and also permanently installed sensors to enable periodical and continuous measurements have to be adapted to deliver the needed information...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and {{wheel and}} the resulting phenomena such as wear and noise are considered as very important issues in railway transportation which allocates considerable research activities in advanced railways in the world yearly since <b>the</b> inappropriate interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel has always brought about costly items such as extreme structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments and fractures of pavement and road bed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines and also automotive transportation and most importantly causes irreparable accidents. By analyzing the repair and maintenance railway costs worldwide, we found that a huge expedition is done in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> purchase, change and installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel in the railway industry every year [5, 6]. The wheel has a special geometric form, and <b>the</b> geometric incompatibility <b>of</b> a wheel’s profile with <b>the</b> geometric characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line could have negative circumstances such as extreme wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel and dynamic instability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway transportation appliance, since <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway appliance and the passengers comfort is dependent on <b>the</b> wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel [7]. Thus, it could be inferred that <b>the</b> compatibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel’s profile is the most vital factor in controlling the wear. <b>The</b> rolling contact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel will cause wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel profile and in return there will be phenomena such as negative effects in dynamic function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train and comfort in traveling, <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> emersion from <b>the</b> line, permanent misshapes, reduction in the wheel longevity, reduction in security, reduction in <b>the</b> repairing period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line and, as a result, a reduction in efficiency {{and an increase in}} costs [8].

Due to <b>the</b> solidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel, small contact area and the heavy weight applied in railway cars, there is high stress that would lead to phenomena such as wear and fatigue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel.|$|R
30|$|It {{is easy to}} {{see from}} above that <b>the</b> {{mutation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> H value curve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> itself can be used as <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> judgment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> surface area.|$|R
2500|$|The {{formula is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the distance (...) between the point where the force (...) is measured and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> is greater than <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> (...) by a factor of about 3 or 4 (...) [...] Some other simplifying assumptions have also been made; to describe the force more accurately, <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and <b>the</b> projectile must be considered.|$|R
50|$|On May 5, 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad crossed Promontory Summit in Utah {{and stopped}} {{just a few}} <b>feet</b> short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Pacific tracks. <b>The</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> were joined, but those {{on the south side}} were left for <b>the</b> driving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> golden spike. On May 7, Promontory was {{overflowing}} with discharged workers; tent saloons were stocked, and the women arrived. A special train from Sacramento had arrived with all <b>the</b> dignitaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Pacific Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The nominal {{track gauge}} is the {{distance}} between <b>the</b> inner faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> In current practice, it is specified at a certain distance below <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> head as <b>the</b> inner faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> head (<b>the</b> gauge faces) are not necessarily vertical.|$|R
