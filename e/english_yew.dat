A small Anagallis (like tenella), and a {{beautiful}} purple primrose, grew by its bank. The {{top of the mountain}} is another flat ridge, with depressions and broad pools. The number of additional species of plants found here was great, and all betokened a rapid approach to the alpine region of the Himalaya. In order of prevalence the trees were,--the scarlet Rhododendron arboreum and barbatum, as large bushy trees, both loaded with beautiful flowers and luxuriant foliage; R. Falconeri, in point of foliage the most superb of all the Himalayan species, with trunks thirty feet high, and branches bearing at their ends only leaves eighteen inches long: these are deep green above, and covered beneath with a rich brown down. Next in abundance to these were shrubs of Skimmia Laureola,* [This plant has been lately introduced into English gardens, from the north-west Himalaya, and is greatly admired for its aromatic, evergreen foliage, and clusters of scarlet berries. It is a curious fact, that this plant never bears scarlet berries in Sikkim, apparently owing to the want of sun; the fruit ripens, but is of a greenish-red or purplish colour.] Symplocos, and Hydrangea; and there were still a few purple magnolias, very large Pyri, like mountain ash, and the common <b>English</b> <b>yew,</b> eighteen feet in circumference, the red bark of which is used as a dye, and for staining the foreheads of Brahmins in Nepal. An erect white-flowered rose (R. sericea, the only species occurring in Southern Sikkim) was very abundant: its numerous inodorous flowers are pendent, apparent as a protection from the rain; and it is remarkable as being the only species having four petals instead of five.|$|E
6000|$|The battle {{continued}} with incredible obstinacy. The Moors knew {{the importance of}} the height to the safety of the city; the cavaliers felt their honors staked to maintain it. Fresh supplies of troops were poured out of the city: some battled on the height, while some attacked the Christians who were still in the valley and among the orchards and gardens to prevent their uniting their forces. The troops in the valley were gradually driven back, and the whole host of the Moors swept around the height of Albohacen. The situation of the marques de Cadiz and his companions was perilous in the extreme: they were a mere handful, and, while fighting hand to hand with the Moors who assailed the height, were galled from a distance by the crossbows and arquebuses of a host that augmented each moment in number. At this critical juncture King Ferdinand emerged from the mountains with {{the main body of the}} army, and advanced to an eminence commanding a full view of the field of action. By his side was the noble English cavalier, the earl of Rivers. This was the first time he had witnessed a scene of Moorish warfare. He looked with eager interest at the chance-medley fight before him, where there was the wild career of cavalry, the irregular and tumultuous rush of infantry, and where Christian and Moor were intermingled in deadly struggle. The high blood of the English knight mounted at the sight, and his soul was stirred within him by the confused war-cries, the clangor of drums and trumpets, and the reports of arquebuses. Seeing that the king was sending a reinforcement to the field, he entreated permission to mingle in the affray and fight according to the fashion of his country. His request being granted, he alighted from his steed: he was merely armed [...] "en blanco"--that is to say, with morion, back-piece, and breast-plate--his sword was girded by his side, and in his hand he wielded a powerful battle-axe. He was followed by a body of his yeomen armed in like manner, and by a band of archers with bows made of the tough <b>English</b> <b>yew</b> tree. The earl turned to his troops and addressed then briefly and bluntly, according to the manner of his country. [...] "Remember, my merry men all," [...] said he, [...] "the eyes of strangers are upon you; you are in a foreign land, fighting for the glory of God and the honor of merry old England!" [...] A loud shout was the reply. The earl waved his battle-axe over his head. [...] "St. George for England!" [...] cried he, and to the inspiring sound of this old English war-cry he and his followers rushed down to the battle with manly and courageous hearts.* They soon made their way into the midst of the enemy, but when engaged in the hottest of the fight they made no shouts nor outcries. They pressed steadily forward, dealing their blows to right and left, hewing down the Moors and cutting their way with their battle-axes like woodmen in a forest; while the archers, pressing into the opening they made, plied their bows vigorously and spread death on every side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{demands for}} Pacific yew bark, {{a source of}} an anticancer agent, have {{generated}} interest in defining the yew resource and in exploring strategies to conserve this species. The distribution, riparian requirements and ecosystem functions of yew populations in coastal and inland forests of northern California are outlined and alternative approaches to conserving this resource are identified. Efforts to obtain additional information on genetic diversity of yew populations and to insure careful management of the species are essential {{for the protection of}} this resource. selective harvesting of the Pacific yew in California, Oregon and Washington. In 1988, 60, 000 pounds of bark were harvested from 12, 000 trees in western Oregon; another harvest of the same magnitude is scheduled for 1989 (C. Bolsinger, personal communication). This paper briefly outlines the current status of the Pacific yew as a facultative component of riparian forest communities in northern California and other Western states, and addresses questions that bear on possible strategies to conserve the yew resource without intervening with ongoing cancer research. Yews represent a genetic resource at risk. At least three species–the <b>English</b> <b>yew</b> (T. baccata), Florida yew (Taxus floridana), and Pacific yew (T. brevifolia) – have evolved an unique assemblage of characteristics that confer upon these trees and shrubs unprecedented vulnerability. The <b>English</b> <b>yew,</b> native to Europe, north Africa and parts of the Middle East, was valued for centuries as a strategic resource. The Florida yew, restricted to bluffs and ravines on the eastern bank of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida (Sargent 1961), is classified as a rare and endangered conifer (Barnes 1983). Now the survival of Pacific yew populations in western states may be threatened by the discovery that yew bark is an important source of an antitumor drug. The yew has the longest tradition as a protected tree. In the 15 th century, <b>English</b> <b>yew</b> populations were severely depleted; their fine-grained elastic wood was valued for archery bows. Laws mandating protection of this species date from 1423, (Szafer, W. 1965, cited in Bialobok, 1975). In many parts of central Europe and the Transcaucasus, the <b>English</b> <b>yew</b> remains a rare an...|$|E
