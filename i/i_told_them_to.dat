500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Latif {{responded to}} the {{spot-fixing}} allegations against the Pakistan team by saying that ICC needs to re-design its laws and rules to root out the match-fixing and spot-fixing problem. Latif {{wrote a letter to}} the ICC citing his concerns back in 2003,"In that letter, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> change the rules and laws in one-day internationals which, were more prone to spot-fixing. I even offered to assist the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but I got no response," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1849-50, Courbet painted Stone-Breakers (destroyed in the Allied Bombing of Dresden in 1945), which Proudhon admired as an icon {{of peasant}} life; it has been called [...] "the first of his great works". The {{painting}} {{was inspired by a}} scene Courbet witnessed on the roadside. He later explained to Champfleury and the writer Francis Wey: [...] "It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come to my studio the next morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't deny it, Squire. But the way <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> {{look at it}} was, Mis' Braile was Christian {{enough for}} the whole family. Said you knowed more law and she knowed more gospel than {{all the rest of}} Leatherwood put together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All {{alone as}} yet,' rejoined the landlord, {{glancing at the}} sky, 'but we shall have more company to-night I expect. Here one of you boys, carry that show into the barn. Make haste {{in out of the}} wet, Tom; when it came on <b>to</b> rain <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> make the fire up, and there's a glorious blaze in the kitchen, I can tell you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last {{year when}} my {{assistant}} took a holiday {{they sent me}} a 'Varsity man. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> not <b>to</b> do it again. Too damned gentlemanly for me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was {{obvious to me that}} it badly needed pepping up. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By the time it was brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Presley's {{explosion}} in popularity in 1956, pressure {{was put on}} Jones to cut a few rockabilly sides and he reluctantly agreed. [...] His heart was never in it, however, and he quickly regretted the decision; in his autobiography he joked, [...] "During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees." [...] He explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "I was desperate. [...] When you're hungry, a poor man with {{a house full of}} kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. [...] I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.' [...] I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and 'Rock It', a bunch of shit. [...] I didn't want my name on the rock and roll thing, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it." [...] Jones went on to say he unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is young}} De Bergillac," [...] he announced. [...] "He {{has been in}} England in search of that missing page of the treaty. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> show him in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] {{she said}} to Norgate, [...] "you must excuse me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{distinctly}} <b>to</b> disconnect the instrument so that it rang only in my bedroom. I am disobeyed, but no matter. Who is that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that matter, I have {{answered}} my judges before. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> report all that I have {{said and done}} to our Holy Father the Pope--to whom, and to God first, I appeal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] said I, as {{they entered}} the little yard, [...] "some of the paint may yet be wet, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put as much drying stuff in as was possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will set}} {{out as soon}} as my other two men return. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be back soon after twelve. I will write to you this evening from Rotterdam. Ah! here are the men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{waited until}} Coulter joined Paxton. The two {{walked out on}} the campus, so I didn't catch what they said. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> follow me, and they are now out in the hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{was a bit}} startled {{when they}} saw my ’ead at the skylight, and then they all started {{at the same time}} asking me wot I was doing. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> <b>to</b> let me out fust and then I’d tell ’em, and one of ’em ’ad just stepped round to the {{companion}} when the skipper come on to the wharf and stepped aboard. He stooped down and peeped at me through the skylight as though he couldn’t believe ’is eyesight, and then, arter sending the hands for’ard and telling <b>’em</b> <b>to</b> stay there, wotever ’appened, he unlocked the companion and came down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} get back sooner," [...] he said; [...] "the case was desperate, and I was afraid to leave it. You will find a key on the chimney-piece--throw it out to me, and I can let myself in; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> bolt the door before I went out." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had evidently}} self-control, {{so when the}} attendants came <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go. When the door was closed he said with {{considerable}} dignity and sweetness, [...] "Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hurried down}} {{and left the}} two ladies on the stairs until I was sure {{everything}} was still safe; and when I saw {{that there had been}} no change in the state of affairs, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come down.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will find}} it a tough job, even then," [...] Reuben said; [...] "but the others must be here long before that. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> keep within two miles of us. They {{have had time to}} ride double that distance, since we made the smoke for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No regular trade," [...] said Makola. [...] "They {{brought the}} ivory {{and gave it}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take what they most wanted in the station. It is a {{beautiful}} lot. No station can show such tusks. Those traders wanted carriers badly, and our men were no good here. No trade, no entry in books: all correct." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the trial, Charlie Moses (Janet's {{paternal}} grandfather) took {{a stance}} supporting the defendants: [...] "We've made our peace with them. They didn't {{know what they}} were doing, even though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> go down that road. They chose to do it anyway. For that mistake ... they're going to pay {{for the rest of their}} lives. I wish them well all the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are only}} keeping up a sham {{pursuit of the}} soldiers, so as <b>to</b> send <b>them</b> well on their way. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> {{overtake}} <b>them,</b> as there was no occasion for any further bloodshed, when you were once out of their hands. By tomorrow morning they will all be at work on their farms again, and, if they keep their own counsel, need not fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have kept}} a few private papers here, which I should {{not care to}} have {{examined}} should the search really take place. I want you <b>to</b> take <b>them</b> back <b>to</b> the hotel for me. The box {{is a little too}} heavy for me to carry, so <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put it in the carriage as a footstool for you. You won't mind that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, now {{you mention}} it, {{it does look}} a little odd from here," [...] he said; [...] "naked, rather. You said so before, you remember, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> plant the shrubs; but while I was away they let {{every one of the}} poor things die. I will ask my architect, Jenkins, if he can't do anything; it might be pulled down, perhaps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{not call}} if my hair turns gray with fright, and I find myself an idiot to-morrow. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> try me, and I won't be found wanting {{at the first}} alarm. I'll be still, if the thing does not touch me till dawn, when I shall know how to act at once, and so save myself from ridicule {{at the cost of}} a wakeful night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The saints {{be praised}} {{that you have}} all escaped, Monsieur Stansfield! We will lose no time. I have two men {{sleeping}} in a cottage, close to where the boat is made fast. They sleep on the ground floor, and I can tap {{at the window and}} get them out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> turn in as they stood, as they might be wanted at any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{after that}} those men looked upon me with awe as being almost more than mortal. No mere man, they said, could have slain those three {{elephants}} {{alone in the}} night-time. I never had any further trouble with them. I believe that if <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> jump over a precipice {{and that they would}} take no harm, they would have believed me.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the closing}} {{performance}} of Balls, Paul Foster's play. There {{must have been}} 35 {{people who came to}} see the play. Many of them had never been there before, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> just <b>to</b> strike the café. Many didn't know what I meant, but they all saw the others picking up chairs and tables. Everybody picked something up and followed me down the street. We took everything, paintings, tables, chairs, coffeepots—everything. Well, they moved me in one hour.|$|R
60|$|To the {{children}} themselves their own mother gave instructions {{that they were}} to do everything that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> and not <b>to</b> tear their clothes or make themselves untidy. These directions, even to myself, at the time, appeared contradictory. But I said nothing. And out into the wilds the four of us departed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{nodded his}} head again, {{and going to the}} men <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> make ready, adding that Indaba-zimbi knew the way. They said that was all right, if Indaba-zimbi had [...] "smelt her out," [...] they should soon find the Star. So we started cheerfully enough, and my spirits were so much {{improved}} that I was able to eat a boiled mealie cob or two as we walked.|$|E
6000|$|Outside {{the women}} and others were {{gathered}} in the gloom. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go to the king, who was dying, and blundered up the slope to search for some white man. No one was to be found, but a Kaffir messenger by the office told me that Malimati was still away and had been sent for. So I returned to my wagon and lay down in it exhausted, for what more could I do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{he fought}} against those fellows of Yoka {{in the street}} of Oda Iseka's village like a man should fight. There ain't any yellow in him, Barbara, and he didn't leave me until there seemed no other way, {{even in the face}} of the things <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> make them go. Don't harbor that against him--I only wonder that he didn't croak me; your dad wanted to, and Mallory wouldn't let him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “One morning I {{heard the}} devil’s own noise of drums and horns, and Dan Dravot marches {{down the hill}} with his Army and a tail of {{hundreds}} of men, and, which was the most amazing—a great gold crown on his head. ‘My Gord, Carnehan,’ says Daniel, ‘this is a tremenjus business, and we’ve got the whole country as far as it’s worth having. I am the son of Alexander by Queen Semiramis, and you’re my younger brother and a god too! It’s the biggest thing we’ve ever seen. I’ve been marching and fighting for six weeks with the Army, and every footy little village for fifty miles has come in rejoiceful; and more than that, I’ve got the key of the whole show, as you’ll see, and I’ve got a crown for you! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> <b>to</b> make two of ’em {{at a place called}} Shu, where the gold lies in the rock like suet in mutton. Gold I’ve seen, and turquoise I’ve kicked out of the cliffs, and there’s garnets in the sands of the river, and here’s a chunk of amber that a man brought me. Call up all the priests and, here, take your crown.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Yes of course, he (Mokhzani) {{is given}} it because I {{instructed}} Petronas. Put {{that in your}} paper.

When I was the prime minister, everything was given to my children[...]." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't it the {{greatest}} ever!" [...] he cried. [...] "You ain't done no damage at all. The carpenters put that wooden slide up wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> they'd have <b>to</b> take it down, {{and they started}} to-day. That's what made them bracin's bust. The hull thing is comin' down,--so what you did don't hurt, nohow." ...|$|R
