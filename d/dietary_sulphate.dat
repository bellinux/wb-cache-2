40|$|Hydrogen {{produced}} during colonic fermentation may be excreted, or removed by H 2 consuming bacteria such as methanogenic and sulphate reducing bacteria. In vitro, sulphate reducing bacteria compete with methanogenic bacteria for hydrogen when sulphate is present. In this study {{the hypothesis that}} sulphate in the diet could alter CH 4 production in vivo has been tested. Six methane excreting volunteers were fed a low sulphate diet (1. 6 mmol/d) for 34 days {{with the addition of}} 15 mmol sodium sulphate from days 11 - 20. Breath methane was measured and viable counts and metabolic activities of methanogenic bacteria and sulphate reducing bacteria determined in faeces. Whole gut transit time and daily stool weight were also measured. When sulphate was added to the diet, breath methane excretion decreased in three of the subjects while faecal sulphate reduction rates rose from 7. 5 (0. 5) to 20. 3 (4. 3) nmol SO 4 reduced/h/g faeces. Sulphate reducing bacteria, which were not detected during the control diet, were found and viable counts of methanogenic bacteria fell from 10 (7) - 10 (9) /g faeces to 10 (6) /g. Methanogenic counts and breath CH 4 recovered after sulphate addition was stopped. No change was found in the other three subjects. Faecal weights and transit times were not different between study periods. It is concluded that methanogenesis is regulated by <b>dietary</b> <b>sulphate</b> if sulphate reducing bacteria are present. <b>Dietary</b> <b>sulphate</b> may allow growth of sulphate reducing bacteria which inhibit the growth of methanogenic bacteria. This may explain the absence of CH 4 in the breath of many people in western populations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dietary</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{may affect}} colonic {{pathophysiology}} because sulphate availability determines {{in part the}} activity of sulphate reducing bacteria in the bowel. The main product of sulphate reducing bacterial oxidative metabolism, hydrogen sulphide, is potentially toxic. Although it is generally believed that the sulphate ion is poorly absorbed, there are no available data on how much sulphate reaches the colon nor on the relative contributions from diet and endogenous sources. To resolve these questions, balance studies were performed on six healthy ileostomists and three normal subjects chosen {{because they did not}} have detectable sulphate reducing bacteria in their faeces. The subjects were fed diets which varied in sulphate content from 1. 6 - 16. 6 mmol/day. Sulphate was measured in diets, faeces (ileal effluent in ileostomists), and urine by anion exchange chromatography with conductivity detection. Overall there was net absorption of <b>dietary</b> <b>sulphate,</b> with the absorptive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract plateauing at 5 mmol/day in the ileostomists and exceeding 16 mmol/day in the normal subjects. Endogenous secretion of sulphate in the upper gastrointestinal tract was from 0. 96 - 2. 6 mmol/day. The dietary contribution to the colonic sulphate pool ranged up to 9 mmol/day, there being linear identity between diet and upper gastrointestinal losses for intakes above 7 mmol/day. Faecal losses of sulphate were trivial (less than 0. 5 mmol/day) in the normal subjects at all doses. It is concluded that diet and intestinal absorption are the principal factors affecting the amounts of sulphate reaching the colon. Endogenous secretion of sulphate by colonic mucosa may also be important in determining amounts of sulphate in the colon...|$|E
40|$|Sulphate is an obligate {{nutrient}} {{for healthy}} growth and development. Sulphate conjugation (sulphonation) of proteoglycans maintains {{the structure and}} function of tissues. Sulphonation also regulates the bioactivity of steroids, thyroid hormone, bile acids, catecholamines and cholecystokinin, and detoxifies certain xenobiotics and pharmacological drugs. In adults and children, sulphate is obtained from the diet and from the intracellular metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids. <b>Dietary</b> <b>sulphate</b> intake can vary greatly and {{is dependent on the}} type of food consumed and source of drinking water. Once ingested, sulphate is absorbed into circulation where its level is maintained at approximately 300  μmol/L, making sulphate the fourth most abundant anion in plasma. In pregnant women, circulating sulphate concentrations increase by twofold with levels peaking in late gestation. This increased sulphataemia, which is mediated by up-regulation of sulphate reabsorption in the maternal kidneys, provides a reservoir of sulphate to meet the gestational needs of the developing foetus. The foetus has negligible capacity to generate sulphate and thereby, is completely reliant on sulphate supply from the maternal circulation. Maternal hyposulphataemia leads to foetal sulphate deficiency and late gestational foetal death in mice. In humans, reduced sulphonation capacity has been linked to skeletal dysplasias, ranging from the mildest form, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, to achondrogenesis Type IB, which results in severe skeletal underdevelopment and death in utero or shortly after birth. Despite being essential for numerous cellular and metabolic functions, the nutrient sulphate is largely unappreciated in clinical settings. This article will review the physiological roles and regulation of sulphate during pregnancy, with a particular focus on animal models of disturbed sulphate homeostasis and links to human pathophysiology...|$|E
40|$|Site-specific {{conditions}} (e. g. {{presence of}} sulphate), {{may be linked}} to the variability in the uptake of selenium in organisms {{at the base of a}} food chain, potentially affecting the risk of adverse effects in higher trophic-level organisms. In this project, the effect of sulphate on selenate bioaccumulation in two primary producers (Lemna minor and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and a primary consumer (Daphnia magna) was explored. When exposed to selenate, all three species exhibited a decrease in selenium tissue concentration with increasing sulphate. When D. magna were exposed to <b>sulphate</b> and <b>dietary</b> selenium, <b>sulphate</b> did not affect selenium tissue concentrations. The results were used to develop equations estimating selenium tissue concentrations when exposed to selenate and sulphate. The strong predictive ability of the equations suggests that selenate, <b>sulphate,</b> and <b>dietary</b> selenium (applicable to D. magna) are important for describing the relationship between selenate and selenium tissue concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The probiotic, Lactobacillus johnsonii and a {{commercial}} organic acid (OA) blend were histologically evaluated as potential non-antibiotic preventatives for necrotic enteritis (NE). A total of 1200 Cobb 500 broilers {{were randomly assigned}} to the following six treatment groups; unchallenged (Control), Clostridium perfringens challenged (Cp), zinc bacitracin (ZnB), organic acid (OA), vehicle and L. johnsonii (Lj) (n= 25 birds/pen, 8 pens/treatment). All treatment groups {{with the exception of the}} Control group were challenged with C. perfringens (Cp). Histological examination revealed that OA and Lj were unsuccessful in preserving intestinal architecture, however ZnB maintained villus:crypt structure comparable to the Control group. Total goblet cell (GC) number/mm villus surface length was not significantly different amongst any of the dietary treatment groups. No interactions between dietary treatment and mucin type were observed. The number of neutral mucin containing GC was significantly greater in comparison to the number of total acidic mucin containing GC in all dietary treatment groups. Cp challenge did not appear to affect the number of neutral or acidic mucin GC however ZnB decreased the number of both neutral and total acidic mucin GC. No significant differences in acidic mucin subtypes (sulphated, sialylated and intermediate) were observed amongst <b>dietary</b> treatments. <b>Sulphated</b> mucin containing GC were the dominant subtype within all treatment groups. Understanding how Cp affects the intestinal wall will assist in the search for NE preventatives. H. M. Golder, M. S. Geier, P. I. Hynd, R. E. A. Forder, M. Boulianne and R. J. Hughe...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress plays {{numerous}} biological roles, both {{functional and}} pathological. The role of oxidative stress in various epidemiologically relevant biological traits in Anopheles mosquitoes {{is not well}} established. In this study, the effects of oxidative stress on the longevity and insecticide resistance phenotype in the major malaria vector species An. arabiensis and An. funestus were examined. Responses to <b>dietary</b> copper <b>sulphate</b> and hydrogen peroxide were used as proxies for the oxidative stress phenotype by determining the effect of copper on longevity and hydrogen peroxide lethal dose. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities were determined colorimetrically. Oxidative burden was quantified as protein carbonyl content. Changes in insecticide resistance phenotype were monitored by WHO bioassay. Insecticide resistant individuals showed an increased capacity for coping with oxidative stress, mediated by increased glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity. This effect was observed in both species, {{as well as in}} laboratory strains and F 1 individuals derived from wild-caught An. funestus mothers. Phenotypic capacity for coping with oxidative stress was greatest in strains with elevated Cytochrome P 450 activity. Synergism of oxidative stress defence enzymes by dietary supplementation with haematin, 3 -Amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole and Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate significantly increased pyrethroid-induced mortality in An. arabiensis and An. funestus. It is therefore concluded that defence against oxidative stress underlies the augmentation of the insecticide resistance phenotype associated with multiple blood-feeding. This is because multiple blood-feeding ultimately leads to a reduction of oxidative stress in insecticide resistant females, and also reduces the oxidative burden induced by DDT and pyrethroids, by inducing increased glutathione peroxidase activity. This study highlights the importance of oxidative stress in the longevity and insecticide resistance phenotype in malaria vectors...|$|R
