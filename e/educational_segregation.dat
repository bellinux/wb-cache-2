25|$|On August 18, 1970, the NAACP {{filed suit}} against Michigan state officials, {{including}} Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The trial began April 6, 1971, and lasted 41 days. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices (such as redlining of certain neighborhoods) and <b>educational</b> <b>segregation,</b> which followed segregated neighborhoods. District Judge Steven J. Roth held {{all levels of government}} accountable for the segregation in his ruling on Milliken v. Bradley. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, withholding judgment on the relationship of housing inequality with education. The court specified that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to analyse the role of {{vocational}} education in the transmission of <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> into the labour market. We compared Switzerland and Bulgaria because gender segregation and the institutional features of the educational systems differ between the two countries. Bulgaria exhibits lower gender segregation in higher education and in the labour market than Switzerland does. The Bulgarian educational system is less occupationally-oriented, which can be observed in the lower share of people with vocational education as well as in the reduced vocational specificity of its education. Specifically, we analysed whether the differences in the degree of occupational orientation of the educational system affect the linkage between education and employment, and thereby also the transmission of <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> into the labour market.|$|R

30|$|In summary, we {{hypothesize that}} the overall gender {{segregation}} in education is higher in Switzerland (which has a strongly vocationalized education system) than in Bulgaria (which has a more general and more academic educational system) (H 1). Moreover, we hypothesize that the linkage between education and employment is stronger in Switzerland (which has a higher vocational specificity) than in Bulgaria (H 2). Finally, we want {{to test the hypothesis}} that more distinct <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in Switzerland more strongly transfers into the labour market than in Bulgaria because of the more pronounced linkage between education and work in the former country (H 3).|$|R
30|$|To sum up, the {{following}} picture emerges for Switzerland, {{a country that}} represents a qualification space: for men with vocational degrees, <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> and the linkage between education and work is higher than for men with a university degree. The stronger linkage between vocational education and the labour market transfers the distinct gender segregation in VET even more strongly into the labour market than the less pronounced gender segregation in university education. As such, {{we were able to}} confirm an institutional explanation for the extensive occupational gender segregation for men in the Swiss labour market. For women, it is primarily the relatively high gender segregation in the university of applied science sector and the segregation in the university sector that transfer into the labour market due to the linkage dynamics.|$|R

30|$|For men in Bulgaria—a country rather {{conceived}} as an organizational space—the linkage {{of education and}} employment (notably weaker than in Switzerland) {{does not affect the}} transmission of gender segregation into the labour market. This means that the higher gender segregation in vocational education does not transfer more strongly into the labour market than the relatively lower segregation levels at Bulgarian universities. This may help explain the lower levels of gender segregation (compared to Switzerland) in the Bulgarian labour market at the job-entry stage. For women in Bulgaria, the linkage between education and work significantly affects the transmission of <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> into the labour market. For them, lower gender segregation at the universities more strongly translates into the labour market than the higher segregation in vocational education, which in turn may also help explain the lower overall gender segregation in the Bulgarian labour market compared to the Swiss case.|$|R

30|$|In {{line with}} those {{research}} findings, {{we assume that}} the occupational specificity of educational offers which is especially prominent in the VET sector enables horizontal gender segregation in education (Kriesi and Imdorf forthcoming), whereas a strong education–employment linkage supports the transmission of gender segregation into the labour market. In contrast, the ‘non-transmission’ of such segregation may result from a weakened linkage which on the one hand allows employers to disregard the field of training or study of job candidates when they hire. On the other hand, graduates may look for employment in occupational sectors they have not specifically been trained for and thereby move to jobs which are less gender-typical than their previous educational trajectory. Based on this, we assume that, in countries where the vocational principle pre-structures schooling as well as the transition into the labour market (qualification space), the <b>educational</b> gender <b>segregation</b> more strongly transfers into the labour market than in countries where the vocational principle is less developed.|$|R

40|$|Chile {{is one of}} the OECD {{countries}} with higher levels of socioeconomic <b>segregation</b> in its <b>educational</b> system. This may be explained by the incidence of institutional factors (fees and school selection processes), sociocultural factors (families’ appraisals and behaviors towards school choice) and contextual factors, among which residential segregation would stand as the most relevant. This article analyzes the relation between school location, students’ socioeconomic status and student’s place of origin (mobility). The data used was gathered from 1613 surveys responded by primary students’ families. The results evidence that residential segregation only partially influences <b>educational</b> socioeconomic <b>segregation,</b> since the capacity of mobility is a key factor to “break” the association between both phenomena. Therefore, residential segregation would affect to a greater extent low socioeconomic status students who attend schools near their homes and travel distances shorter than children from higher socioeconomic status, who tend to cover longer distances between home and school. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis of the cases complicates drawing conclusions, because students of equal socioeconomic status travel very different distances. The characteristics of the territories where schools are located shed some light on the cause of these differences. From these results, we propose re-discussing the use of the residential segregation concept for explaining phenomena like school segregation, due to the complex interrelations between both territorial fragmentation and urban mobility...|$|R
