It passeth the {{judgment}} of any man to say how it is; but truly the tales I do hear of her maketh me to think she had a strange mind in her: as <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you at my coming.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever tell you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so that you could all be surprised. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Bruno Apitz, {{a member}} of the Communist Party of Germany, was incarcerated at Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp from 1937 to 1945. He later recalled that in the last months before liberation, he heard about a little Jewish child who had been harbored by the International Camp Committee and protected from the SS guards. In a 1974 interview, Apitz claimed he swore that [...] "If I will survive, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> the story of this child." ...|$|E

Khánh claimed that [...] "After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little {{prosecution}} of the war effort." [...] He claimed he had built up intelligence infrastructure to weed out the Việt Cộng under Diệm's rule, but that the other generals had disbanded it and released communist prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to tell myself {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different. So <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> myself, [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up". [...] Craven subsequently posted the quotation on the internet and it now appears on hundreds of websites.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} Myrick's {{statement}} on Little Crow {{and his band}} was clear however. In a letter to General Sibley, Little Crow {{said it was a}} major reason for commencing war: [...] "Dear Sir – For what reason we have commenced this war <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you. it is on account of Maj. Galbrait [...] we made a treaty with the Government a big for what little we do get and then cant get it till our children was dieing with hunger – it is with the traders that commence Mr A J Myrick told the Indians that they would eat grass or their own dung." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{original}} Norwegian black metal musicians believe that black metal {{does not need to}} hold any ideologies. For example, Jan Axel [...] "Hellhammer" [...] Blomberg of Mayhem has {{said in an interview with}} Metal Library: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you that neither I nor other [...] members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else.

[...] Although rejecting the idea of [...] "Christian black metal", Satyricon's vocalist Sigurd Wongraven stated in the Murder Music documentary that black metal [...] "doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic as long as it's dark".|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January 1990, {{addressing}} Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell {{claimed that}} if the Conservatives played the [...] "British card" [...] at the next general election, they could win; the new mood in Britain for [...] "self-determination" [...] had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a [...] "beacon", adding that Britain should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom, adding: [...] "We are taunted—by the French, by the Italians, by the Spaniards—for refusing to worship at the shrine of a common government superimposed upon them all... where were the European unity merchants in 1940? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you. They were either writhing under a hideous oppression or they were aiding and abetting that oppression. Lucky for Europe that Britain was alone in 1940".|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Pratt's wife Sarah Pratt {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} that, while in Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her [...] "one of his spiritual wives" [...] while Pratt was in England on missionary service. To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied, [...] "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me." [...] She issued an ultimatum to Smith: [...] "Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> Mr. Pratt on his return home. Depend upon it, I will certainly do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, {{you want me to tell}} you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E
2500|$|At [...] below {{sea level}} and [...] below the {{mountains}} {{on either side of}} the scorching Jordan Valley, here for weeks at a time, the shade temperature rarely dropped below [...] and occasionally reached at the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead [...] was recorded. Coupled with the heat, the tremendous evaporation of the Dead Sea which keeps the still, heavy atmosphere moist, adds to the discomfort and produces a feeling of lassitude which is most depressing and difficult to overcome. In addition to these unpleasant conditions the valley swarms with snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, great black spiders, and men and animals were tormented by day and night by swarms of every sort of fly. Trooper R. W. Gregson 2663, described the Jordan Valley to his family, [...] "...it's a terrible place. I will never tell anyone to go to hell again; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> him to go to Jericho, and I think that will be bad enough!" ...|$|E

[...] He then announces that Princess Ida has forsworn men and founded a women's university at Castle Adamant, {{one of his many}} country houses. [...] The two Kings advise Hilarion to go to Castle Adamant to claim Ida, and that if she refuses him, Hildebrand will storm the castle ("P'raps if you address the lady"). [...] But Hilarion plans to use romantic means, rather than force, to gain the princess's love. [...] He explains that nature has [...] "armed" [...] him and his friends, the courtiers Cyril and Florian, to win this [...] "war" [...] ("Expressive glances will be our lances"). The three set off to Castle Adamant, while King Gama and his sons are to remain at Hildebrand's palace as hostages ("For a month to dwell in a dungeon cell").|$|E
