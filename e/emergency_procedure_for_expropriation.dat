50|$|According to Mançano rural censuses {{collected}} since 1940 indicated ongoing {{concentration of}} land ownership, {{accompanied by an}} exodus of farmers to urban areas. Reversing the trend would have required the annual settlement of 150,000 families. During Itamar Franco's Government, the INCRA (National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform) achieved about 10,000 settlements annually. A fast-track <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>expropriation</b> of large landholdings was established, ending long delays, one of the measure's main obstacles.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} the provisions of the MPRDA amount to [...] "institutional expropriation" [...] of mineral rights. Other scholars have preferred a case-by-case analysis to determine how conventional common-law rights have been substituted by new rights under the MPRDA, while yet others argue that the MPRDA amounts to nothing more than a legitimate exercise of the state's regulatory powers over property law. The <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>expropriation</b> is set out in the MPRDA, and the state has certain obligations in respect of compensation.|$|R

5000|$|Gey {{died from}} {{pancreatic}} cancer on November 8, 1970 in Baltimore, Maryland, {{less than a}} year after his initial diagnosis. When undergoing an <b>emergency</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> his cancer, doctors found that the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, lungs and heart, thus making his cancer inoperable. Gey traveled to New York City to enroll himself in an experimental chemotherapy trial. He wanted doctors to try to cut out a piece of the cancer in his liver to grow a new cell line for cancer research. The doctors, however, didn't listen to him during the surgery and he was [...] "furious" [...] when he woke up, although he died later.|$|R
50|$|During the {{approach}} to runway 32 at Málaga, a warning light in the cockpit indicated {{a fire in the}} port engine. In fact, it was a false alarm, possibly caused by moisture and/or dirt in the circuitry, though the crew did not know this. The captain continued {{the approach}}, while the co-pilot followed the <b>emergency</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> an engine fire. In the process, he erroneously activated the fire-handles for the right engine as well as the left, causing them both to stop. The plane landed some 500m short of the runway threshold and came to rest against the embankment of the N-340 motorway. The pilot did not report anything to the PA.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{expands the}} Small Aircraft Transportation System, (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) concept to include off-nominal conditions. The general philosophy underlying the HVO concept is {{the establishment of}} a newly defined area of flight operations called a Self-Controlled Area (SCA). During periods of poor weather, a block of airspace would be established around designated non-towered, non-radar airports. Aircraft flying enroute to a SATS airport would be on a standard instrument flight rules flight clearance with Air Traffic Control providing separation services. Within the SCA, pilots would take responsibility for separation assurance between their aircraft and other similarly equipped aircraft. Previous work developed the <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> normal HVO operations. This document provides details <b>for</b> off-nominal and <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> situations that could be expected to occur in a future SCA...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{waterlogging}} seriously {{threatens the}} safety of urban residents and properties. Wargame simulation research on resident emergency evacuation from waterlogged areas can determine the effectiveness of emergency response plans for high risk events at low cost. Based on wargame theory and emergency evacuation plans, we used a wargame exercise method, incorporating qualitative and quantitative aspects, to build an urban waterlogging disaster emergency shelter using a wargame exercise and evaluation model. The simulation was empirically tested in Daoli District of Harbin. The {{results showed that the}} wargame simulation scored 96. 40 points, evaluated as good. From the simulation results, wargame simulation of urban waterlogging <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> disaster response can improve the flexibility and capacity for command, management and decision-making in emergency management departments...|$|R
25|$|A scuba diver {{primarily}} moves underwater {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a mask to improve underwater vision, exposure protection, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these certifications. These include standard operating <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications.|$|R
5000|$|March 2, 2012: The {{pilot of}} a Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche, {{registration}} number [...] N373JT, notices indications of low alternator voltage while {{en route from}} Crystal City, Texas to Denton, Texas; after attempting to troubleshoot the problem in-flight, he performs a precautionary landing at Northwest Regional after entirely losing radio communications capability. The aircraft touches down normally, but the main landing gear legs collapse during the landing roll, causing substantial damage to the aircraft; the pilot suffers minor or no injuries. The investigation reveals that the electrically operated landing gear was functioning normally but did not lock in the DOWN position due to inadequate power; the accident is attributed {{to the failure of}} the pilot to follow the correct <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> operating the gear following a loss of electrical power.|$|R
5000|$|Fire {{prevention}} includes minimizing ignition sources, {{as well as}} {{educating the}} occupants and operators of the facility, ship or structure concerning operation and maintenance of fire-related systems for correct function, and <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> including notification <b>for</b> fire service response and emergency evacuation.|$|R
40|$|Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) is a well-accepted <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> the {{treatment}} of early post-traumatic degenerative disease of the wrist. Much less frequently, PRC has been advocated as an <b>emergency</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> irreparable fracture-dislocation of the wrist. Our objective was to compare the results of PRC in patients having undergone this procedure in the two contexts. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiographic results of six patients treated by emergency PRC as compared to six patients who underwent elective PRC. The mean follow-up was 36 months. Both the patient's satisfaction and the grasp of the wrist joint were significantly better in patients who underwent PRC emergency as compared to those having undergone elective PRC. Quick DASH score, radiographic results, and return to work were also more favourable in these patients, but {{the difference between the}} two groups was not significant. This study confirms that PRC is a valuable salvage technique indicated in early posttraumatic wrist collapse. Moreover, when performed in <b>emergency,</b> the <b>procedure</b> shows even better subjective and objective results, allowing a majority of patients to return to their previous job...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{conclusion of this}} study is that the negotiations between the parties ends when conflicts arise from property owners, and with this the time will be extended and be more costly. During the study it has been shown that good communication is the key to an effective and successful negotiation between the parties. The purpose {{of this study is}} to investigate how the practical procedure under expropriation is in relation to the legal text, in other words, describe and analyze the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>expropriation</b> under current rules but also to explain how it operated in practice. This is to get a picture of how the process works and what effects it receives. Three methods were used for the study. A literature review <b>for</b> understanding how <b>expropriation</b> relates according to the law. A case study from an ongoing expropriation in Sundsvall municipality, and an interview with seven affected interested parties from the expropriation. Reviewed literature describes how the application of the Expropriation Act must go to as well as other research on the topic. A flow chart of the expropriation process is presented as a result of the literature review. In the case study reported problems that arise in an expropriation and also the steps taken by the municipality in connection with expropriation. The municipality's application <b>for</b> <b>expropriation</b> and ongoing plan is compiled to explain the municipality's object of expropriation. In the interview study performed by the property owner opinions and points of view on the matter was prepared. With these two methods, the practical process is analyzed and the sub-questions answered...|$|R

30|$|Four of {{the first}} {{deliveries}} (25  %, 4 / 16) were vaginal, all among women belonging to Group B. However, 12 (75  %) were via cesarean section, most (75  %) involving <b>emergency</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> various reasons. The mean (±SD) duration of the cesarean section was 67  min (± 31  min), and blood loss was 2400  ml (± 2050  ml) with {{no difference between the}} groups. Similarly, there were intraoperative difficulties in 10 (83  %) cases: 6 cases (i.e., 50  %) of severe adhesions, four cases of difficulties with extraction of the neonate, 2 cases of bladder laceration, 1 case of uterine atony, and 1 case of difficult placental retrieval. None of the women concerned had had severe complications during their UTE operations. Both women with bladder injuries had undergone partial cystectomy because of bladder endometriosis (group B).|$|R
