5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to incubate the eggs, and the young <b>fledge</b> ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young <b>fledge</b> until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and <b>fledge</b> in about three weeks.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of growth rate, final size, {{hatching}} sequence, hatching asynchrony, and <b>fledging</b> asynchrony on the <b>fledging</b> age of Black and Red kites (Milvus migrans and M. milvus). Feather growth explained 43 % and 38 % {{of the variance in}} <b>fledging</b> age of Black and Red kites, respectively. <b>Fledging</b> age increased with hatching sequence and increased <b>fledging</b> asynchrony in relation to initial hatching asynchrony of both species, especially in broods of three chicks. Once {{the effect of}} growth was removed, no differences in <b>fledging</b> age related to hatching sequence were found in the Red Kite, but there was still a delay in <b>fledging</b> of third-hatched Black Kite chicks. Synchronous <b>fledging</b> of first- and second-hatched Black Kite chicks seemed to occur when both chicks had grown at a similar rate, and was caused by a delay in the <b>fledging</b> of the first-hatched chick. First-hatched Black Kite chicks did not delay <b>fledging</b> if second-hatched chicks experienced reduced growth. Differences between the two species in the third-hatched-chick <b>fledging</b> delay could be due to differences in nest provisioning by adults during the postfledging dependence period. Red Kites reduced provisioning to the nest as soon as the first chick fledged, while Black Kites maintained nest provisioning longer. No evidence was found supporting the idea that parents may reduce feedings to hasten first flight of their offspringPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} nest leaving (<b>fledging)</b> in hole-breeding passerines is largely unexplored, {{although}} it is potentially an important facet of reproduction. We used the great tit, Parus major, to investigate whether <b>fledging</b> timing and order were affected by nestling development and sex, {{as well as the}} sex ratio in the brood the nestlings were raised in. Because of the difference in size and competitiveness between male and female nestlings, we expected to find an effect of sex and brood sex ratio (BSR) on the process of <b>fledging.</b> To explore its effect on <b>fledging</b> experimentally, we manipulated BSR by swapping 6 -day-old nestlings of both sexes. We implanted transponders in all 14 -day-old nestlings to determine timing and order of <b>fledging.</b> The brood age at <b>fledging</b> was best explained by average wing length of the brood (negative), average body mass of the brood (positive) and hatching date (negative). In contrast to our hypothesis, BSR did not affect <b>fledging</b> time. Also, the asynchrony of <b>fledging</b> within broods did not depend on BSR. Within broods, <b>fledging</b> order was not affected by sex or by the interaction between sex and BSR. Nestlings with long wings on day 14 fledged earlier than nestmates with shorter wings. Although females were lighter at day 14, they had similar length wings as their male nestmates. Nestlings should keep up with their nestmates during development, because developmental status relative to nestmates, rather than sex-specific competition, influenced the process of <b>fledging.</b> (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to <b>fledge.</b> In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks <b>fledge</b> on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Between October and January, and peaking in November, {{the species}} {{normally}} lays two smooth, white eggs, though sometimes it lays three or four. The incubation period and fledging {{time of this}} ground roller is unknown. After the young <b>fledge,</b> {{they live in a}} family group of four to five birds until approximately February, at which point the family disperses.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and <b>fledge</b> in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fledging</b> is {{the stage}} in a young bird's life between {{hatching}} and flight. For altricial birds, those that {{spend more time in}} vulnerable condition in the nest, the nestling and <b>fledging</b> stage can be the same. For precocial birds, those that develop and leave the nest quickly, a short nestling stage precedes a longer <b>fledging</b> stage.|$|R
40|$|Fitness {{consequences}} {{of variation in}} body mass growth and body condition were studied in a Sandwich Tern Sterna sandvicensis colony on Griend, Dutch Wadden Sea, during 1990 - 2000. Body mass increment during the linear growth phase predicted nestling survival probabilities accurately. Chicks growing less than 8 g per day had low survival probabilities until <b>fledging,</b> but within a range of 8 - 11 g per day growth only small effects on chick survival were observed. Effects of slow growth on survival became obvious after about 10 days after hatching. Slow growing chicks reached a much lower <b>fledging</b> mass, whereas slow growth had only small effects on structural size at <b>fledging.</b> Body condition of the chicks was highly variable and had strong effects on survival until <b>fledging.</b> However, body condition during the nestling stage did not influence post-fledging survival. Body condition at <b>fledging</b> had no effects on post-fledging survival and did not affect final mass or body size. It is argued that low <b>fledging</b> mass can be overcome soon after <b>fledging,</b> as parents take their fledglings closer to the foraging areas, thereby avoiding high rates of kleptoparasitism by Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{consequences}} of differences in growth rate on the subsequent survival of Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus chicks. <b>Fledging</b> success increased sharply with growth rate, from zero in chicks growing at less than 6 g per day to about 85 % in chicks growing at more than 10 g per day. The age at which chicks fledged varied from 27 to 52 days. Chicks which fledged {{at an early age}} displayed a much faster growth rate than later <b>fledging</b> chicks. Although slow growth resulted in a considerable prolongation of the period before <b>fledging,</b> slow-growing chicks fledged at a smaller size and with a lower body-weight than fast-growing chicks. After <b>fledging,</b> all chicks remained almost completely dependent on their parents up to an age of 3 months and often longer. Almost 40 % of the fledglings eventually returned to the breeding area. This figure probably reflects post-fledging survival. Age and size at <b>fledging</b> had no effect on a chick's probability of return. Body-weight at <b>fledging</b> had a small positive correlation with the return probability, but this was not statistically significant. We conclude that although slow growth severely reduces a chick's chance of <b>fledging,</b> it probably does not result in irreversible damage causing an increased risk of mortality during the first years after <b>fledging.</b> Apparently, any possible disadvantage associated with small size or low bodyweight could be compensated for after hedging...|$|R
5|$|Females {{lay between}} three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young <b>fledge</b> at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The egg size is {{independent}} of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks <b>fledge</b> 31–41days after hatching.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty {{after a few}} days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they <b>fledge</b> in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of <b>fledging</b> age {{are needed in}} field studies to avoid inducing premature <b>fledging</b> or missing the <b>fledging</b> event. Both may lead to misinterpretation of nest fate. Correctly assessing nest fate and length of the nestling period can be critical for accurate calculation of nest survival rates. For researchers who mark nestlings, knowing {{the age at which}} their activities may cause young to leave nests prematurely could prevent introducing bias to their studies. We estimated <b>fledging</b> ages from grassland passerine nests monitored from hatching through <b>fledging</b> with miniature video cameras in North Dakota and Minnesota during 1996 - 2001. We compared these values to those obtained from traditional nest visits and from the literature. Mean and modal <b>fledging</b> ages for video-monitored nests were generally similar to those for visited nests, although Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) typically fledged 1 day earlier from visited nests. Average <b>fledging</b> ages from both video and nest visits occurred within ranges reported in the literature, but expanded by 1 - 2 days the upper age limit for Clay-colored Sparrows and the lower age limit for Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). Video showed that eggs hatched throughout the day, whereas most young fledged in the morning (06 : 30 - 12 : 30 CDT). Length of the hatching period for a clutch was usually 3 ̆e 1 day and was positively correlated with clutch size. Length of the <b>fledging</b> period for a brood was usually 3 ̆c 1 day, and in nearly half the nests <b>fledging</b> was completed within 3 ̆c 2 hr. Video surveillance was a useful tool for obtaining new information and for corroborating published statements related to hatching and <b>fledging</b> chronology. Comparison of data collected from video and nest visits showed that carefully conducted nest visits generally can provide reliable data for deriving {{estimates of}} survival...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{selection}} {{can vary}} in magnitude, form and direction, yet {{the causes of}} selection, and of variation in selection, are poorly understood. We quantified {{the effect of a}} key predator (Eurasian sparrowhawks) on selection on <b>fledging</b> body mass in two bird species (blue tits and great tits). By partitioning selection into within- and between-brood components, we were able to separate individual from brood-level effects of <b>fledging</b> mass on predation probability and recruitment. In blue tits, selection on <b>fledging</b> mass by sparrowhawk predation was nonsignificant and could not explain selection to recruitment. In contrast, in great tits, sparrowhawk predation selected for increased <b>fledging</b> mass at the individual level and could explain 73 % of individual-level selection on <b>fledging</b> mass to recruitment. Moreover, in great tits, individual-level selection on <b>fledging</b> mass was significantly stronger in years in which sparrowhawks were present compared to years when sparrowhawks were absent. Selection at the brood level was independent of sparrowhawk presence. These results provide compelling evidence that sparrowhawk predation acts as an important causal agent of selection on <b>fledging</b> mass in great tits but not in blue tits. Variation in predation pressure can therefore account for variation in selection, but specific patterns may not be easily generalized across species. © 2013 British Ecological Society...|$|R
50|$|The {{little hermit}} lays two {{eggs in a}} conical nest {{suspended}} under a large leaf. Incubation and <b>fledging</b> period not reported, but probably as relatives where incubations is 14-16 days, and <b>fledging</b> another 20-23 days.|$|R
5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch. The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks <b>fledge</b> in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has {{completed}} moulting.|$|E
5|$|The jays {{travel in}} groups of two to ten {{individuals}} and may join mixed-species flocks. It is a secretive species and therefore difficult to observe in the wild. As an omnivore, this jay eats berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. Females lay three to four eggs, and the young <b>fledge</b> after twenty days. This species is listed as Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened with extinction.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and <b>fledge</b> after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
50|$|The life stages {{from the}} {{initiation}} of a clutch, through to hatching and <b>fledging</b> are a direct response to {{the availability of the}} berries as a food source, with <b>fledging</b> occurring just before berry ripening has reached its peak.|$|R
40|$|In birds, {{individuals}} with a higher mass at <b>fledging</b> {{have a higher probability}} of recruiting into the breeding population. This can be because mass is an indicator of general condition and thereby of the ability to survive adverse circumstances and/or because <b>fledging</b> mass is positively related to competitive strength in interactions with other fledglings. This latter explanation leads to two testable predictions: (i) there is stronger selection for <b>fledging</b> mass when there is more severe competition (i. e. at higher densities); and (ii) that besides absolute <b>fledging</b> mass, relative mass of fledglings within a cohort is important. We test these two predictions in two great tit (Parus major) populations. The first prediction was met for one of the populations, showing that competition affects the importance of mass-dependent recruitment. The second prediction, that fledglings recruit relatively well if they are heavy compared to the other fledglings, is met for both populations. The consequence of the importance of relative rather than absolute <b>fledging</b> mass is that the fitness consequences of reproductive decisions affecting <b>fledging</b> mass, such as clutch size, depend on the decisions of the other individuals in the population...|$|R
5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young <b>fledging</b> each year and their survival rate. Chicks <b>fledging</b> under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those <b>fledging</b> under poor conditions.|$|R
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they <b>fledge</b> around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can <b>fledge</b> after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they <b>fledge</b> at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young <b>fledge</b> after two to three months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fledging</b> {{period is}} 10 days. For {{a few days}} after <b>fledging,</b> young remain in nest {{territory}} and crouch unmoving under shrubs; after a few days they will move off with parents and join local flocks where the young continue to be fed by parents.|$|R

5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, {{to which it}} is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to <b>fledge.</b> Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young <b>fledge</b> after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to <b>fledge.</b> Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E
