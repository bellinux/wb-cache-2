The first outlines of the story were written by Corbucci with his friend Piero Vivarelli; the pair wrote backwards from the final scene of the film.

In the {{conducting}} profession {{those who have}} {{had the power to}} create this role have been men and, thus, through weight of <b>historical</b> and societal <b>precedence</b> masculine leadership is largely unchallenged as the norm on the podium. Renowned for their mythical status, visual prominence, high paying rank, and commanding relationship with the orchestra, conductors have visibly embodied a gendered form of leadership. Up until recently, the only way that women have been able successfully to negotiate these powerfully gendered constructs has been by desexualising themselves and conforming to a male-oriented paradigm in their dress, gestures, behaviour, leadership styles, and familial commitments. (1) In this paper I will limit the discussion to issues relating to power and leadership. Women conductors have had to mould their behaviour in ways that have often been contradictory to what society expects of them as 'normal' females. They have had to find a subtle balance between the authoritative leadership that the conducting profession demands and the more collaborative approach to leadership that they are often socialized to follow. In this paper I will use narrative descriptions to explore the tensions that a number of the world's renowned female conductors have faced in negotiating their way into this leadership position. I will also examine how feminine approaches to this role have the potential to work with the changing dynamics of orchestras today to redefine a number of the role's masculine power constructs.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{proposal}} for a way of building for a Nature-Oriented Spirituality. It begins an exploration into what a community might look like for people who see the land and the seasons as the generators of life. This process requires that the link between belief and physical form be made explicit and what this implies about the places that we make and inhabit. The project is a Ritual Community, a home and gathering place for the EarthSpirit Community. EarthSpirit is a New England based organization of individuals and groups whose beliefs are based generally on pre-Judeo / Christian myths and traditions, especially those of northern Europe and the British Isles. It is a spiritual construct quite different than that of the society at large, with profound implications both for the social and built environment. Since the late Middle Ages the practice of these beliefs has been out of necessity secretive and underground. Therefore there is no modern and little <b>historical</b> built <b>precedence</b> from which to start. The development of an attitude about both the landscape and how to place buildings within it is the central issue of this thesis. Rather than being prescriptive, an attitude provides guidance in how to approach the design and building processes without requiring use of a specific "style" of constructional system. By attuning the attitude toward physical form with the general attitudes and beliefs of a community, the outcome of the building process should provide an appropriate environment for that communitie's life and activities. The basic Pagan and Wiccan beliefs are an understanding and abstraction of Nature and the cycles of the seasons. Building a community for Pagans and Witches implies that appropriate attitudes can be found in understanding how the landscape behaves and using that understanding as the basis for building. Since the community accepts the physical character of the Universe as real and important, it is that which we can experience in the world that should guide how we integrate ourselves into Nature. We too are part of nature, not outside of it, and so part of building is finding a balance between the willful act of changing the environment to support us and allowing the land to continue on with its own business of fertility, growth, decline and death. The narrative character of shared symbols and geometries also have a place in the making of the built environment, their purpose to tell a story, to provide specific associations with the beliefs of the community. Where the narrative character of the building is it's most important feature, such as in the Ritual Building, these will come into use directly. In general. however, it is what we learn from the landscape which will generate an appropriate building method. by Scott R. Pollack. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|This thesis {{begins by}} tracing {{the rise of}} the piano etude from Chopin to Ligeti, {{establishing}} <b>historical</b> and compositional <b>precedence</b> for Ligeti's Etudes pour piano. Special emphasis is given to the formal, virtuosic, and rhythmic development in the etude in the hands of selected composers, as these are the central features to be discussed in Ligeti's music. Formally, examples drawn from Debussy's etudes show experimentation in defining form using sonority and figuration. Technically, the etudes of Liszt and Rachmaninov set a new level of proficiency at the keyboard with their dazzling virtuosity. Excerpts showing polyrhythmic passages and the manipulation of rhythm are extracted from the etudes of Chopin, Skryabin, Bartok, Prokofiev and Stravinsky. These examples also show hemiola {{as a starting point for}} rhythmic and temporal complexity. A compositional and pianistic overview of Ligeti's three books of Etudes pour piano and a brief chapter on Ligeti's life and musical style follow. However, the core of this document is an in-depth analysis of Automne a Varsovie and a discussion of formal principles and the effect of "chaotic order" as achieved through the manipulation of rhythmic perception. The basic structural musical shape of Automne a Varsovie consists of an expectant build to climax followed by a sudden sabotage of musical momentum. This is achieved primarily through the accumulation and subsequent disintegration of texture, dynamic, and rhythmic complexity, as shown through numerous music examples. The effect of chaos is achieved through the manipulation of rhythmic perception [...] -in particular, Western notions of such. Central African music and the player piano music of Nancarrow are discussed as non-traditional influences. Further, extensive illustration of the rhythmic illusion inherent in the hemiola and Ligeti's innovations in extending this principle are discussed. The last chapter of this document deals with the relationship between performance and traditional, "serious" analysis by questioning the usefulness of such detailed analysis of Automne a Varsovie in practical performance. Referencing writings by Cone, Meyer, Berry, Rink, and Fisk, the concluding chapter also describes some interpretative choices and other types of analysis used in preparing a meaningful performance of this work...|$|R

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{critical}} {{attention has been paid}} over the last twenty years at least to the relation of 'self and 'Other'. But what happens when the external 'other' is displaced to the periphery of the concerns of textual production? In order to explore this question Methodological Embodiments employs an interdisciplinary praxis that {{is not limited to the}} classic model of written theory. At the same time, it does not negate this form that has <b>historical</b> and ideological <b>precedence</b> within an academic context. The aim of this thesis is to juxtapose written theory with artistic practices in order to initiate, develop and represent a dialogue between subjectivity and methods of theoretical engagement. The performative negotiation between the embodied experience of the practitioner and the investigative forms constitute a tripartite relation that implicates 'performance' as a third term in the methodological formulation. The final submission includes 1) a written dissertation, Methodological Embodiments :: Psychical Corporeal Performances of Subjective Specific Auto[erotic]-Representations; 2) an exhibition, I::Matter; and 3) the live performance, I::Do. My thesis argues for, and enacts, a positive framing of individual embodied experience within a dialogue between linguistic and artistic practices. Academia has traditionally privileged the written word in the definition of 'theory'. This has limited the understanding of how meaning is made and how the subject as scholar is implicated within the production of knowledge. At the same time, within classic psychoanalysis, subjectivity has also come to be understood through, and in relation to, language. While language clearly has a significant part to play in the making of both theory and a/the subject, it must be situated in relation to individual embodiment. Classic psychoanalysis falls short of this insofar as it fails to take into account the implications of sexual difference. This neglect has resulted in the construction of phallocentric frameworks that not only misrepresent women as a 'model' of disease and lack, but problematically foreclose the possibility of symbolic agency for a/the woman. The relation between materiality and image as regards representation is significant to these discourses of subjectivity, language and art, respectively and at the points in which they overlap. Throughout the thesis many specific terms and concepts have been either coined or reappropriated in order to situate and accurately define the concerns of my work. Two important examples are cited here. First, my recourse to the psychoanalytic term psychical corporeality, which suggests that embodiment simultaneously informs and inscribes the psychical perceptions of the subject in relation to surrounding environments and a sense of self. Secondly, in place of the psychoanalytic use of Narcissism is my use of autoeroticism that seeks to re-define the literary genre of autobiography and the traditional understanding of self-portraiture in the visual arts, to what I have called auto[erotic] - representation(s) within my own textual production...|$|R
40|$|How might a sonic {{archiving}} installation practice produce {{conditions of}} history other to orthodox narratives of time? What might a Benjaminian “destructive character” today make of analogue and digital archives for producing uncanny encounters within chips of messianic time? The above dialectical image maps out my research site. At my crossroads stands History proper and historical ambiguity—spoken as ‘I’, my site inscribes difference in archiving things from Victoriana inspired moments, filtered through {{a girl from}} Auckland, New Zealand circa 1980 s and 1990 s (culminating most poignantly in 1994). My installation practice evokes particularly voices materialised through sonic forces aided through photographic, filmic, and recording apparatuses and their representational modalities. These sonic forces material my artistic research practice as a historic figure existing within me as an artist-researcher figuring out (my) different narratives. I employ myself here {{as a type of}} destructive (Benjaminian) figure, making radical sonic interventions as historic otherness appear to me to bring to ‘light’ Walter Benjamin’s conceptual historic materialism of time as: the true picture of the past; time at a standstill; moment of danger; ambiguity; dialectical image that is pregnant with tensions; uncanny limits to ourselves. I unpack these radical expressions of time and history—that are marked out above in my dialectical image; my site of research—through the following exegesis. I figure my practice (my self) dangerously between the dominance of orthodox archiving narratives to specify an acute ‘familiar’ moment—say 1994 (1994 : Time-space encounters between digital forces and analogue ghosts). I read my project as the dialectical image above and hope that one can better understand this site increasingly throughout the reading of this exegesis. This understanding of time at a [dialectical] standstill is taken from the philosopher Walter Benjamin. This time of arrest is counter to linear time that is often posed as the dominant voice throughout historicism [discourses] (i. e. writing history) that marginalises other voices and other experiences. My practice works within this site of investigation to privilege lost voices that explore a longing for historic authenticity—where the location of authenticity lies in its alterity, in what is distant to the present time and space. Benjamin practices [destructive] lyrical configuration through the modern allegory, which I here explore through my practice in the form of anachronistic spatial configuration (installation) as a method for [sonic] archiving. The anachronistic structuring of my installation tests activate dialectical tensions that speak to us of the hidden voices repressed by the orthodox structure of things; through juxtaposing and rupturing orthodox histories via my relations to things in the world. This has become in part an autobiographical tenor that lyrically composes my exegesis and installation as a methodology. It does this bearing in mind the viewer’s independence, where my own autos is largely heterogeneously fractured into the archival installation final exhibition aiming for uncanny registers that can only be designed by the ‘hand’ of weak messianic power (Benjamin). My sonic forces mapping out the research aims of this installation archiving practice are inspired primarily by the work of Walter Benjamin's concept of Messianic time in relation to historical materialism. My artistic research has focused in on relations of voices through time; voices that have spoken to me throughout (auto) biographical encounters with artefacts; things that continue to return and inhabit me more so than I realise. These things are speaking to me now, here; at a crux moment of a self-splitting between some fantasy autos of my biography, and yet they are shot through with the voices of those philosophers I am engaging and their autos. In this sense, my artistic material and precedence gather around the literary, poetic, and mystical voices of others (people, antiques, commodities, spaces, places, photographs, films and other textual forms of archival material). The images that make up my work emerge from the imagination, now brought to the fore through these textual methodological encounters that inspire my way through. In this sense, my practice appears on the surface to be voiding the proper of art <b>historical</b> practitioner <b>precedence,</b> and yet in this way I have followed an authentic (unorthodox) path that is akin to the destructive character Benjamin evokes. The images of others sit below this surface only to rise uncannily in the strange present that this time evokes. The concept of the uncanny, guided by voices of Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud and Walter Benjamin, open up my mystical moments for installing such an encounter of strange time as a survival of things...|$|R
