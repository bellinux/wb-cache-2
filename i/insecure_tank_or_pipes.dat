It is used as the base aggregate in the construction of solid floors and as an insulating aggregate for baseplates. The gravel is self-interlocking with a high friction angle and is used in road construction, particularly useful in areas of marshy ground or permafrost marginal zones where it can reduce the degradation of the road base.

50|$|For use in {{open air}} applications, where the sensor cannot be mounted {{to the bottom}} of the <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> thereof, a special version of the {{hydrostatic}} pressure level sensor can be suspended from a cable into the tank to the bottom point that is to be measured. The sensor must be specially designed to seal the electronics from the liquid environment. In tanks with a small head pressure (less than 100 INWC), it is very important to vent the back of the sensor gauge to atmospheric pressure. Otherwise, normal changes in barometric pressure will introduce large error in the sensor output signal. In addition, most sensors need to be compensated for temperature changes in the fluid.|$|R

40|$|Knowing the {{enthalpy}} of hydrate slurry is very {{essential for}} energy balance and industrial applications. No direct measurement processes {{had been developed}} in this field in the past time. A new experimental method with special device has been developed to carry out on-line measurement of the thermal properties for hydrate slurry under dynamic conditions. With this special device, {{it is possible to}} deliver the hydrate slurry to the high pressure DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) directly from the production <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes.</b> Thermal data acquisition will be performed afterwards by DSC. The investigated conditions were at pressure of 30 bar and temperature 0 ~+ 7 °C. The dissociation enthalpy of CO 2 hydrate slurry was about 54 kJ/kg, corresponding 10. 8 % of solid fraction. The on-line measurement results for CO 2 hydrate slurry give a good tendency to apply this phase change slurry to the industrial refrigeration process.

40|$|Ultrasound {{has long}} been known to be capable of {{measuring}} water level. Zero-degree ultrasound transducers may be used to send an L-wave through the fluid and receive a reflected signal from the fluid/gas interface surface. The level of the fluid is proportional to the sound wave time of flight to traverse the water path. This approach may even be used from outside the fluid containment wall by sending the wave through the <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> bottom. The approach, however, does not work well if there is only a thin layer of fluid consisting of one or two millimeters or even only a few droplets. Surface waves are also known {{to be sensitive to the}} presence or absence of fluid on a surface. A surface wave may be transmitted a significant distance by a transmitting transducer and then received by a similar transducer. If the surface along the wave path is wet with even a few droplets of fluid, the surface wave may be significantly attenuated. Generating and measuring such a surface wave from the opposite side of a <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> containment wall and separating the near-wall surface wave from the far-wall surface wave, however, is more challenging. An approach for producing a surface wave on the opposite side of a steel plate to sense the presence or absence of fluid is discussed. This approach is supported by 2 -D finite element modeling of the measurement configuration and by empirical demonstration of the technique’s sensitivity. This technique was developed for measurement of a very small amount of fluid that may condense within a spent nuclear fuel canister after it cools for several years. Such small amounts of fluid are of concern for initiating stress corrosion cracking over the decades that these nuclear waste containment structures are expected to remain leak-free. Early detection of fluid would provide advance warning of potential cracks in time for mitigation or management of the waste inside that container. Other potential applications include any non-intrusive liquid container fluid detection, detection of fluid within inaccessible plena of aircrafts or other complex welded skin structures...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, an innovative, {{remotely}} operated retrieval system was deployed to successfully retrieve over 99. 7 % of the radioactive sludge from ten submerged tanks in Hanford's K-West Basin. As part of K-West Basin cleanup, the accumulated sludge {{needed to be}} removed from the 0. 5 meter diameter by 5 meter long settler tanks and transferred approximately 45 meters to an underwater container for sampling and waste treatment. The abrasive, dense, non-homogeneous sludge was the product of the washing process of corroded nuclear fuel. It consists of small (less than 600 micron) particles of uranium metal, uranium oxide, and various other constituents, potentially agglomerated or cohesive after 10 years of storage. The Settler Tank Retrieval System (STRS) was developed to access, mobilize and pump out the sludge from each tank using a standardized process of retrieval head insertion, periodic high pressure water spray, retraction, and continuous pumping of the sludge. Blind operations were guided by monitoring flow rate, radiation levels in the sludge stream, and solids concentration. The technology developed and employed in the STRS can potentially be adapted to similar problematic waste <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> that must be remotely accessed to achieve mobilization and retrieval of the sludge within...|$|R

40|$|Fiji, an upper-middle income {{state in}} the Pacific Ocean, has {{experienced}} an increase in confirmed case notifications of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). To characterize the epidemiology of typhoid exposure, we conducted a cross-sectional sero-epidemiological survey measuring IgG against the Vi antigen of S. Typhi to estimate the effect of age, ethnicity, and other variables on seroprevalence. Epidemiologically relevant cut-off titres were established using a mixed model analysis of data from recovering culture-confirmed typhoid cases. We enrolled and assayed plasma of 1787 participants for anti-Vi IgG; 1, 531 of these were resident in mainland areas {{that had not been}} previously vaccinated against S. Typhi (seropositivity 32. 3 % (95 %CI 28. 2 to 36. 3 %)), 256 were resident on Taveuni island, which had been previously vaccinated (seropositivity 71. 5 % (95 %CI 62. 1 to 80. 9 %)). The seroprevalence on the Fijian mainland is one to two orders of magnitude higher than expected from confirmed case surveillance incidence, suggesting substantial subclinical or otherwise unreported typhoid. We found no significant differences in seropositivity prevalences by ethnicity, which is in contrast to disease surveillance data in which the indigenous iTaukei Fijian population are disproportionately affected. Using multivariable logistic regression, seropositivity was associated with increased age (odds ratio 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 1. 4) per 10 years), the presence of a pit latrine (OR 1. 6, 95 %CI 1. 1 to 2. 3) as opposed to a septic <b>tank</b> <b>or</b> <b>piped</b> sewer, and residence in settlements rather than residential housing or villages (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 7). Increasing seropositivity with age is suggestive of low-level endemic transmission in Fiji. Improved sanitation where pit latrines are used and addressing potential transmission routes in settlements may reduce exposure to S. Typhi. Widespread unreported infection suggests there may be a role for typhoid vaccination in Fiji, in addition to public health management of cases and outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|The term Leak-Before-Break (LBB) {{refers to}} a {{well-established}} safety criterion used to assess whether cracked <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipes</b> can leak detectable amounts of fluid as a warning before catastrophic failure occurs. In this research The LBB criterion {{was applied to the}} safety assessment of spherical Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) containment systems on ships. For this type of LNG tanks, the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC) requires several fracture mechanics analyses of fatigue crack growth. Details on how these analyses should be carried out can be found in industry codes. Although these codes provide guidance on most aspects of an LBB assessment, they are not fully satisfactory with regard to their recommendations on how to calculate the growth of deep semi-elliptical surface cracks, on how to estimate the crack shape when the crack snaps through the tank wall and how to assess these through-thickness cracks in the stage right after breakthrough. The aim of this research was to more accurately simulate the development of cracks for LBB applications. To do so, a new numerical calculation model have been developed for the estimation of crack growth, crack shape development and crack propagation after wall penetration. In addition, Finite Element Models (FEM) have been developed to predict the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), a parameter that characterises the local stress distribution in the vicinity of a crack-tip and is commonly used in fracture mechanics. Finite Element (FE) analyses were conducted to evaluate existing, approximative SIF solutions for deep, semi-elliptical surface cracks and to find a new, FE-derived SIF solution for through-thickness cracks after breakthrough. Both the new FE-derived and existing SIF solutions were used in the numerical model. The results of different SIF solutions and numerical model configurations were then compared to experimental data from the literature in order to find recommendations for the enhancement of existing LBB procedures.

To prevent rupturing the thin Invar tank material, pressure is controlled by venting the natural gas evaporate. Natural gas is either released to the atmosphere via vent stacks located above the cargo <b>tanks</b> <b>or</b> compressed and <b>piped</b> to the ship's boilers, which are designed to operate simultaneously on natural gas and fuel oil.|$|R
40|$|Slurry {{suspension}} {{in holding}} tanks and transport through pipelines are essential {{elements in the}} modern mining and mineral processing industry. This paper presents methods to improve the energy efficiency of solids suspension in tanks and slurry transport through pipelines for low viscosity Newtonian slurries. Research has been conducted using laboratory experiments and analysis using established equations. It is shown {{that there are many}} similarities between these two traditionally separated research areas. It is concluded that energy per unit solids mass generally varies with solids concentration for both systems. The specific energy can be minimised by operating at a suitable solids concentration, for example in the range of 20 - 30 % (v/v) for the slurry properties considered in this paper. It is also concluded that the specific energy generally decreases with the size of equipment, i. e. <b>tank</b> diameter <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter, although this effect tends to plateau at large sizes. It was found that when a slurry pipeline is used as a reactor, it generally requires more power to suspend solids per unit solids mass than a mixing tank. Great energy saving can be achieved by operating a slurry tank with baffles removed, if off-bottom solids suspension is the limiting factor. Basic equations for specific energy consumption (SEC) are included...|$|R

The principal advantage of frictional welding, being a solid state process, low distortion, absence of melt-related defects and high joint strength, even in those alloys that are that are considered non-weldable by conventional welding techniques. Furthermore, friction welded joints are characterized by the absence of filler-induced problems or defects, since the technique requires no filler, and by the low hydrogen contents in the joints,an important consideration in welding steel and other alloys susceptible to hydrogen damage. FW can be used to produce butt, corner, lap, T, spot, fillet and hem joints, as well as to weld hollow objects, such as <b>tanks</b> and tubes <b>or</b> <b>pipes,</b> stock with different thickness, tapered section and parts with 3 -dimensional contours.
