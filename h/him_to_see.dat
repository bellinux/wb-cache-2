5|$|Ellis {{threw the}} no-hitter despite {{being unable to}} feel the ball or see the batter or catcher clearly. Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore {{reflective}} tape on his fingers which helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck out six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, whilst back in Paris, Hunter met Alice Toklas, whom he {{had known}} {{previously}} in San Francisco. She took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the collection at 27 rue de Fleurus, that was being started by Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo Stein. Toklas wrote of this re-meeting that Hunter was at first shocked by the style of artists such as Matisse, but obviously strongly impressed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> clearly.|$|E

5|$|Alan and Alice {{arrive at}} a cabin on {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} with a {{deformed}} left arm from the effects of a rare object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. His left eye allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E

5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 8 {{minutes after}} the DC-7 had {{departed}} Los Angeles, a U.S. Air Force F-100F-5-NA Super Sabre jet fighter, serial number 56-3755, took off from Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas at 7:45a.m. on a training flight with two pilots on board. In {{the front seat of}} the tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D. Moran, 24, who as part of his training would spend the flight under a hood that blocked his view outside the aircraft, but allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his instrument panel.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E

Olave left, traveling by boat and foot to Drontheim. Most versions gloss over the journey, which compares and contrasts their pagan and Christian natures.|$|R

5|$|Jagadish, {{a captain}} in the Indian Army, returns to Mumbai from Kashmir. On his arrival, his parents and younger sisters force <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Nisha, who they choose {{for him to be}} married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagadish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, which {{includes}} commenting about her being old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha is a college-level boxer, who is completely modern in her outlook. Jagadish realises this and proposes to her, which after initial refusal, she reciprocates.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he could catch them.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E

5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{features}} {{a series of}} challenge maps separate from the game's story mode that are unlocked while playing, and others are available as optional downloadable content (DLC). The maps focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, and subduing patrolling enemies while using stealth. The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players. On the PlayStation 3, the Joker is a playable character in the combat and stealth challenge maps via optional DLC; he must confront the asylum guards and police commissioner James Gordon. The Joker has his own combat abilities and weapons, such as a handgun, exploding chattering teeth, and x-ray glasses which allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> opponents through walls.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time after}} this, I let my son know I was married, and invited <b>him</b> over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us, {{and my husband}} wrote a very obliging letter <b>to</b> <b>him</b> also, {{inviting}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come and <b>see</b> him; and he came accordingly some months after, and happened to be there just when my cargo from England came in, which I let him believe belonged all to my husband's estate, not to me.|$|R

5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Danevirke.|$|E
5|$|Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link {{that they}} were headed for Hyrule; she instructs <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and {{makes his way to}} the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
