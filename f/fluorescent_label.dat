40|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>labeling</b> is {{a method}} used for {{visualization}} of various types of biomolecules including proteins and protein complexes. However, the effect of protein labeling on protein structure and functions has not been investigated so far. The goal of the diploma thesis was to examine an influence of NHS-fluorescein binding on structure and function of human carbonic anhydrase I (hCA-I). The particular aims of this work were to prepare recombinant 15 N-hCA-I which was used for NMR structure analysis of carbonic anhydrase upon <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labeling.</b> Furthermore, enzyme activity was measured {{in order to find}} out a correlation between the concentration of NHS- fluorescein and protein function. In addition, the reaction mixtures were systematically analyzed by ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The analysis revealed experimental conditions for <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labeling</b> of human carbonic anhydrase I with minimal effect on protein structure and function. The results of this study show that the calculation of molar excess of NHS-fluorescein cannot rely on a simple procedure provided by manufacturer. However, due to decrease of enzyme activity upon <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labeling,</b> it is better to take into count the influence of NHS-fluorescein concentration on the relative enzymatic activity.

However, instead of using <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labeled</b> 9-mer probes that distinguish only 6 bases, 2-base encoding takes advantage of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labeled</b> 8-mer probes that distinguish the two 3 prime most bases but can be cycled similar to the Macevicz method, thus greater than 6bp reads can be obtained (25-50bp published, 50bp in NCBI in Feb 2008). The 2 base encoding enables reading each base twice without performing twice the work.|$|R

Here monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides are the compounds of interest. They are labeled at their reducing ends with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> (i.e. a fluorophore). This derivitization with a fluorophore permits both separation on a gel under the desired circumstances and fluorescence imaging of the gel. In this case, a polyacrylamide gel is used.|$|E

Later, Rabilloud et al. used RuBPS as a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> for protein detection in polyacrylamide gels.

5000|$|The Streptamer {{staining}} principle {{combines the}} classic method of T cell isolation by MHC-multimers with the Strep-tag/Strep-Tactin technology. The Strep-tag {{is a short}} peptide sequence thatdisplays moderate binding affinity for the biotin-binding site of a mutated streptavidin molecule, called Strep-Tactin. For the Streptamer technology, the Strep-Tactin molecules are multimerized and form the [...] "backbone", thus creating a platform for binding to strep-tagged proteins. Further, the Strep-Tactin backbone has a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> to allow flow cytometry analysis. Incubation of MHC-Strep-tag fusion proteins with the Strep-Tactin backbone results {{in the formation of}} a MHC-multimer, which is capable for antigen-specific staining of T cells.|$|E

Rather than a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> traditionally used in microarray applications, ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology utilizes a photoinitiator that, when activated by light, generates signal amplification through polymerization of an organic monomer. The detection technology is easy to use and can be completed within minutes when applied to low-density microarrays. The ampliPHOX Reader is used to activate photopolymerization on low-density microarrays, to image the resulting pattern of visual spots, and automatically interpret the image - providing the user with immediate results.|$|E

5000|$|In {{its modern}} inception, {{high-throughput}} genome sequencing involves fragmenting the genome into small single-stranded pieces, followed by amplification of the fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Adopting the Sanger method, each DNA fragment is irreversibly terminated with {{the incorporation of}} a fluorescently labeled dideoxy chain-terminating nucleotide, thereby producing a DNA “ladder” of fragments that each differ in length by one base and bear a base-specific <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> at the terminal base. Amplified base ladders are then separated by Capillary Array Electrophoresis (CAE) with automated, in situ “finish-line” detection of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA fragments, which provides an ordered sequence of the fragments. These sequence reads are then computer assembled into overlapping or contiguous sequences (termed [...] "contigs") which resemble the full genomic sequence once fully assembled.|$|E
50|$|The FRET {{aspect of}} the {{technology}} is driven by several factors, including spectral overlap and {{the proximity of the}} fluorophores involved, wherein energy transfer occurs only when the distance between the donor and the acceptor is small enough. In practice, FRET systems are characterized by the Förster's radius (R0): the distance between the fluorophores at which FRET efficiency is 50%. For many FRET parings, R0 lies between 20 and 90 Å, depending on the acceptor used and the spatial arrangements of the fluorophores within the assay. Through measurement of this energy transfer, interactions between biomolecules can be assessed by coupling each partner with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> and detecting the level of energy transfer. Acceptor emission as a measure of energy transfer can be detected without needing to separate bound from unbound assay components (e.g. a filtration or wash step) resulting in reduced assay time and cost.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, salt {{concentration}}, and formamide concentration on the emission characteristics of commonly used <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labels</b> were evaluated on DNA microchips. The emission intensities of different fluorophores without hybridization were observed to vary, each {{to a different}} extent, to mainly temperature changes. Rhodamine red, TAMRA (tetramethylrhodamine), and dyes from the carbocyanide group exhibited the largest variations, and Texas Red and Oregon Green exhibited the smallest variations. This temperature dependency was shown to affect results obtained during melting curve analysis in DNA microarray studies. To minimize the bias associated with the temperature-dependent emission of different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>labels,</b> a normalization step was proposed...|$|R
50|$|In single {{particle}} imaging applications, {{the number}} of photons detected from the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label</b> {{plays a crucial role}} in the quantitative analysis of the acquired data. Currently, particle tracking experiments are typically carried out on either an inverted or an upright microscope, in which a single objective lens illuminates the sample and also collects the fluorescence signal from it. Note that although fluorescence emission from the sample occurs in all directions (i.e., above and below the sample), the use of a single objective lens in these microscope configurations results in collecting light from only one side of the sample. Even if a high numerical aperture objective lens is used, not all photons emitted at one side of the sample can be collected due to the finite collection angle of the objective lens. Thus even under the best imaging conditions conventional microscopes collect only a fraction of the photons emitted from the sample.|$|E
50|$|More recently, the {{technique}} {{has been used}} to study exocytosis in chromaffin cells. When imaged using DIC, chromaffin cells appear as round cells with small protrusions. When the same cell is imaged using IRM, the footprint of the cell on the glass can be clearly seen as a dark area with small protrusions (see Figure 2 in the gallery below). When vesicles fuse with the membrane, they appear as small light circles within the dark footprint (Figure 2, bright spots in the top cell in the right panel). An example of vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells using IRM is shown in movie 1. Upon stimulation with 60 mM potassium, multiple bright spots begin to appear inside the dark footprint of the chromaffin cell as a result of exocytosis of dense core granules. Because IRM doesn't require a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>label,</b> it can be combined with other imaging techniques, such as epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy to study protein dynamics together with vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Another benefit of the lack of fluorescent labels is reduced phototoxicity.|$|E
5000|$|In the GeneCalling protocol, mRNAs {{are first}} {{isolated}} from a given sample and processed into fragments for analysis.
