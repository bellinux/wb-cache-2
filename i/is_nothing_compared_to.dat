5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say something to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
25|$|Proteus insinuates {{that he will}} rape her ("I'll force thee {{yield to}} my desire"), but at this point, Valentine {{intervenes}} and denounces Proteus. Horrified at what has happened, Proteus vows that the hate Valentine feels for him <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the hate he feels for himself. Convinced that Proteus' repentance is genuine, Valentine forgives him and seems to offer Silvia to him. At this point, overwhelmed, Julia faints, revealing her true identity. Upon seeing her, Proteus suddenly remembers his love for her and vows fidelity to her once again. The Duke and Thurio are brought as prisoners by the outlaws. Seeing Silvia, Thurio claims her as his, but Valentine warns Thurio that if he makes one move toward her, he will kill him. Terrified, Thurio renounces Silvia. The Duke, disgusted with Thurio's cowardice and impressed by Valentine's actions, approves his and Silvia's love, and consents to their marriage. The two couples are happily united, and the Duke pardons the outlaws, telling them they may return to Milan.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

[...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> {{what they had to}} go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E

The song also reached number one in Australia, the United Kingdom and number two in Canada, while charting within the top ten in numerous other countries.|$|E

His opposition to land concessions {{is so strong that}} Aryeh Eldad, the deputy of Israel's conservative National Union party, remarked, [...] "As I shook his hand, I told Tom DeLay that until I heard him speak, I thought I was farthest to the right in the Knesset."

[...] According to the BBC News Service, {{during the year}} 2003 alone—a full decade after the song's initial release—Romero and Ruiz made USD$250,000 in royalties. Julio Iglesias is quoted as congratulating the duo personally: [...] "My success singing in English from Miami <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> yours; coming out of Dos Hermanas with little international exposure elsewhere and selling these many records in Spanish takes two huge sets of cojones." ...|$|E

His statement was described as crude and insensitive by NME. Morrissey later elaborated on his statement, saying, [...] "If you quite rightly feel horrified at the Norway killings, then it surely naturally follows that you feel horror at the murder of ANY innocent being. You cannot ignore animal suffering simply because animals 'are not us.'" ...|$|E

How can some speak of beauty, when they've never seen Rešice and the fields from Kordula to Rešice, who never strolled through the warm dirt there, who never felt the warm air and over the grain fields, who never saw our chapel in the milk of white cherries, Husák's garden, which always reminded me of Sholokhov, especially the dirt lumps under the [...] "vortex" [...] and the [...] "Bare Hill" [...] {{and all the other}} places on all of which I am. Parts of me are all over the world. In England, little was left of me, maybe more in Scotland... 27 years of life behind me. Death for my homeland.

[...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4.

6000|$|But {{it was not}} a book, but {{a little}} {{mechanical}} toy, which lay in a box--an artificial nightingale which was like the real one, only that it was set all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. When it was wound up, it could sing the piece the real bird sang, and moved its tail up and down, and glittered with silver and gold. Round its neck was a little collar on which was written, 'The Nightingale of the Emperor of Japan <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> that of the Emperor of China.' ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's cantata Hymnus amoris for soloists, chorus and {{orchestra}} was first performed at Copenhagen's Musikforeningen (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897.

5000|$|Corot is {{a pivotal}} figure in {{landscape}} painting. His work simultaneously references the Neo-Classical tradition and anticipates the plein-air innovations of Impressionism. Of him Claude Monet exclaimed in 1897, [...] "There {{is only one}} master here—Corot. We <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> him, nothing." [...] His contributions to figure painting are hardly less important; Degas preferred his figures to his landscapes, and the classical figures of Picasso pay overt homage to Corot's influence.|$|R
60|$|But the {{difficulty}} {{in the case of}} the cat <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> {{the difficulty}} in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for on scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.|$|E

[...] She desired to have everything brought up to her, but he said: [...] "There is such a quantity of things {{that it would take}} many days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house."

You have been the prince of the Spartans, and a prince ought, at least, to be equal to two common men; so that {{to show that the}} Spartans in general could be brought to fight a superiority of force of even ten to one, it ought to appear that you would dare to engage twenty.

And even this proportion of ten to one, or even twenty to one, <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the real disparity; for, even if we grant to the Spartans as large a force as there is any possibility of their obtaining, I shall then have a thousand to one against them.|$|E
