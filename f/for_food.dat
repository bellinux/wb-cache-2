They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E

5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of human culture, in the broad sense of social behaviour, customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken.

40|$|Has {{there been}} any {{structural}} change in demand <b>for</b> <b>foods?</b> The question of whether {{there has been a}} structural change in demand <b>for</b> <b>foods</b> in the United States has received much attention, especially after a sharp decline in beef consumption and a steady increase in poultry products consumption in the late 1970 s. The issue of structural change in demand <b>for</b> <b>foods</b> is important to <b>food</b> producers <b>for</b> their production plans and marketing strategies, such as the meat industry’s decision as to whether to scale down the size of cattle herds or spend more money for a meat promotion program. The structural change issue is also important to food policy decision-makers to know whether there is a shift in demand <b>for</b> <b>foods</b> toward a healthy diet because unhealthy food consumption causes obesity and overweight and imposes heavy physical and economic tolls on the Nation. In studying structural change in demand <b>for</b> <b>foods,</b> many economists such as Chavas (1983), Eales and Unnevehr(1988), Moschini and Meilke (1989), and Huang and Hahn (1995) focused on the meats. In the consumer budgeting process, however, changes in any food other than meats may be equally important in determining food demands. A complete food demand system including all foods should be implemented so that the interdependent deman...|$|R

In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
