50|$|As {{they make}} a getaway down an access lane, O'Shea and Pennant are {{released}} by Dr Wayne and the girls. O'Shea and Pennant then only have one minute to remove the explosives from the <b>dynamite</b> <b>store</b> room before it blows up. They push the explosives cart {{down the hill and}} towards the access lane, sending the cart crashing onto the getaway Buick in a dramatic explosion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Senor Hirsch," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have enough}} <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> {{up at the}} {{mountain}} to send it down crashing into the valley"--his voice rose a little--"to send half Sulaco into the air if I liked." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some Nationalist reporters {{suggested}} that the town had been bombed from the air, but by Republican airplanes. The bombs {{were said to have}} been made in the Basque country and the explosions happened because of <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> in the sewers. Another theory by Nationalists was that there were a [...] "few bomb fragments found" [...] in Guernica, but the damage was mainly caused by Basque incendiaries. Franco's regime minimized the bombing for decades. In 1970, newspaper Arriba claimed that there had only been twelve deaths during the bombing raid.|$|R
50|$|On March 3, 1910, {{there was}} a massive {{explosion}} on the 1,100-foot level of Mexican mine. The blast was so powerful a miner on the 900-foot level died in the accident. The explosion was due to eight cases of <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> in a magazine. The area was designed {{that in the case}} of an explosion, the fumes would go up through the shaft and not suffocate the miners. Unfortunately, the men killed and wounded were directly in the way of the blast. Thirty nine men and one horse were killed in total. The 1910 explosion was the worst disaster in Alaska mining history.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{manufactured}} no evidence!" [...] bawled Jason Sparr. [...] "Didn't {{that young}} rascal of a Lawrence say he'd get square with me, and didn't {{all of you}} say the same? Wasn't you down to the blowing up of the bridge, right where they had all that <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored?</b> Wasn't some of the dynamite sticks stolen? Didn't you fellows come right by the hotel afterwards? Wasn't the blowing up done by clockwork, made to go off hours after it was set? You can't tell me! You are guilty. Besides, I got other evidence--I got a letter," [...] added the hotel-keeper, shrewdly.|$|R
50|$|After Camp Merritt was {{dismantled}} {{for almost}} a year the camp underwent a series of three devastating fires. The reason for the three fires are still undetermined although there were various rumors and speculations to how they were started. The fire started in Block 17 and destroyed over 150 buildings in that particular area. Over eighteen fire companies attended to the fire including three from New York City. There were two reports of dynamite explosion because there were <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> for the use in the wrecking of the camp. There were no reported injuries due to the fire, but {{what was left of the}} Camp was destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, a fire struck. On June 27, after a dry three weeks, fire {{broke out}} among the drying piles in the Upham mill's lumberyard, ignited by a spark from a train. The fire spread, {{consuming}} the sawmill and flour mill, and headed south into homes and the business district. Men {{tried to stop the}} inferno, even <b>dynamiting</b> <b>stores</b> to create a fire break, but the updraft lifted embers and dropped them onto more buildings. When it was over, 250 buildings were destroyed, but no lives were lost. The next day, Upham announced he would rebuild his businesses. Neighbors in Stevens Point, Spencer and Wisconsin Rapids sent trainloads of supplies. The city ruled that buildings on Central should henceforth be built from brick, even though Marshfield had been largely built on wealth generated by lumber.|$|R
50|$|The blaze {{formed a}} horseshoe-shaped front over 36 km wide with flames {{shooting}} 30 m into the air. It laid waste to about 200,000 hectares (over 494,000 acres) of forest and {{killed at least}} 70 people, though early reports indicated thousands. Many people were drowned as they fled into Porcupine Lake to escape the flames, while others suffocated to death under the mines. At one point, a car of <b>dynamite</b> <b>stored</b> at the railway station exploded, lashing the lake into waves 3 metres (nine feet) high. The exact number of dead is not known as the vast forest in the region contained {{an unknown number of}} prospectors {{at the time of the}} fire. Official counts list 73 dead, though it is estimated the actual toll could have been as high as 200.|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 1931, a {{cache of}} <b>dynamite</b> being <b>stored</b> in case it was needed to break the ship free from the ice pans exploded, {{destroying}} {{the stern of the}} ship, killing 27 men, including Frissell. The ship subsequently sank, and Frissell's body and his pet Newfoundland dog, Cabot, were never found.|$|R
5|$|In July, three {{associates}} of Berkman—Charles Berg, Arthur Caron, and Carl Hanson—began collecting <b>dynamite</b> and <b>storing</b> {{it at the}} apartment of another conspirator, Louise Berger. Some sources, including Charles Plunkett, one of the surviving conspirators, say that Berkman was the chief conspirator, {{the oldest and most}} experienced member of the group. Berkman denied any involvement or knowledge of the plan.|$|R
50|$|Comité Régional d'Action Viticole (CRAV, Regional Committee for Viticultural Action), or {{sometimes}} Comité d'action viticole (CAV, Committee for Viticultural Action) {{is a group}} of militant French wine producers. It has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks including <b>dynamiting</b> grocery <b>stores,</b> a winery, the agriculture ministry offices in two cities, burning a car at another, hijacking a tanker, and destroying large quantities of non-French wine.|$|R

60|$|Brown {{brought the}} word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred yards away. Grief was squatted over a small fire, broiling a strip of shark-flesh. The last twenty-four hours had been lucky. Seaweed and sea urchins had been gathered. Tehaa had caught a shark, and Mauriri had {{captured}} a fair-sized octopus {{at the base of}} the crevice where the <b>dynamite</b> was <b>stored.</b> Then, too, in the darkness they had made two successful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed them out.|$|R
50|$|During April 1967, Bingman's Drug Store {{and several}} {{neighboring}} buildings on West Main Street in downtown Circleville were destroyed when Lee Holbrook, {{the husband of}} a drug store employee, brought a wooden box containing bundled <b>dynamite</b> to the <b>store</b> and it detonated during a struggle with the store's staff. Holbrook and four store employees died in the blast and ensuing fire; nearly 30 others were injured. Holbrook's wife {{was not at the}} store and was not among the injured.|$|R
5000|$|The explosions were {{preceded by}} two tons of {{dynamite}} being smuggled from Sollihøgda into Oslo, after the dynamite was stolen by Leif Kjemperud and others. (Responsibility for the smuggling, was had by a subdivision of the Pelle Group—the Ullevål Hageby Gang. Sverre Kokkin and others bicycled, with dynamite, from Hønefoss to Oslo. Dynamite was also transported to Oslo by lorry, hidden in potato sacks."When the lorry was stopped at check point, they only saw potatoes. During transfer and reloading, {{one of the}} sacks opened" [...] and dynamite spilled onto the sidewalk, and the driver {{did not know what}} he had been a part of.) The <b>dynamite</b> was <b>stored</b> at Kampen, Oslo by a different subdivision of the group. Shipyard employees smuggled the dynamite into their workplace, where it was stored under one of the [...] "boats".|$|R
50|$|Just {{outside the}} village to the south west, near the main Langport and Castle Cary Railway line is the 14 acre Green Down Nature Reserve run by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. It {{is on the side}} of Windmill Hill and {{provides}} a habitat for a range of species including the largest number of large blue butterflies anywhere in the world. At the eastern end of the reserve is a Powder House which was used by the Great Western Railway to <b>store</b> <b>dynamite</b> used in the construction of the Somerton Tunnel from 1903 to 1905.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, June 4, {{the police}} searched the Klenner household and found numerous firearms, explosives, and prescription drugs. Over 15 guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades, illegal military equipment, {{and a couple}} of claymores were found at Fritz's house. The police also found a case and a half of <b>dynamite</b> that was <b>stored</b> behind the Klenner residence. It is assumed that the missing half-case of dynamite was the cause of the explosion in the car. Inside Fritz's office, the police found evidence which showed that he was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and an avid supporter of the Ku Klux Klan.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin was}} built in 1939 at Giant Mine, north of today's Yellowknife. It is {{sometimes}} inaccurately stated, including on the building's interpretive plaque, that it {{was used as a}} blacksmith's shop; in reality it was used to <b>store</b> <b>dynamite</b> used during shaft sinking to reach the Brock gold vein. In the following decade more secure bunkers were built closer to the shaft, so the cabin was used instead for storage of other supplies, such as reagents. It continued in that use until 1973, when the mining company sold it to the local Chamber of Commerce for CDN$1, which moved it to very near its present location.|$|R
5000|$|I {{believe that}} this moral {{obligation}} far overrides our obligation to obey man-made laws. ...I {{felt that it was}} necessary to begin the development of a resistance movement that could carry out sabotage and expropriations... Hansen, in her closing words at trial On the night of July 27, 1982, a British Columbia Department of Highways explosives storehouse north of Squamish was entered, and 38.5 cases of dynamite were stolen. On September 13, a local hunter came upon two wooden structures that had been built in the forests of Garibaldi, near the site of the theft. One contained four reels of detonating cord and three boxes of electric blasting caps, and the other building held 28.5 cases of dynamite, as well as explosive gelatins. This indicates that ten crates of <b>dynamite</b> were not <b>stored</b> in the wooden structures, to which Taylor and Hansen held keys.|$|R
25|$|Within {{one week}} of being sworn into office, Baxley had {{researched}} original police files into the bombing, discovering {{that most of}} the original police documents were lackluster and inefficient. Nonetheless, Baxley formally reopened the case into the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1971. Baxley was able to corroborate with and build trust with key witnesses, some of whom had been reluctant to testify in the first trial. Other witnesses obtained were able to identify Chambliss as the individual who had placed the bomb beneath the church. Baxley also gathered evidence proving Chambliss had purchased <b>dynamite</b> from a <b>store</b> in Jefferson County less than two weeks before the bomb was planted, upon the pretext the dynamite was to be used to clear land the Ku Klux Klan had purchased near Highway 101. In addition, he also obtained testimony from witnesses who were able to place Robert Chambliss and his car {{in the vicinity of the}} church on the day of the bombing. This testimony and evidence was used to formally construct a case against Robert Chambliss.|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as possible; all I have to {{see about}} are the <b>dynamite</b> and <b>stores</b> for the journey. We know pretty well by this time what we shall want. We are sure {{to be able to}} buy mealies and a bullock when we want one from the natives. Some tea and coffee, a dozen tins of {{preserved}} milk, and half a hundredweight of biscuits, in case of finding ourselves at a lonely camp with no native kraals near, and we shall be all right. Of course we will take a gallon or two of paraffin, a frying-pan, a small kettle, and so on, and a lantern that will burn paraffin. We will fill up our pouches with a hundred rounds of rifle cartridges and fifty for our revolvers, and then I think we shall be ready. Now mind, the success of our enterprise depends entirely upon your all keeping the secret absolutely. Neither Willesden, Brown, nor Peters have friends here to bother themselves about their absence. We {{are not likely to be}} missed, but if any questions are asked, you can say casually that we are off on a scouting expedition. I shall write four or five letters, with dates a week or ten days apart, and direct them from here, and leave them for you to post one by one to my mother. Be sure you send them in the right order. As she will suppose that we are stopping here quietly, and out of all harm, she won't be uneasy about me. Peters' and Willesden's friends have gone to England, so they are all right, and Brown's are at the Cape. You had better write two or three letters too, Brown, to be posted a fortnight or three weeks apart." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 12, 1912, the Italian {{language}} {{branch of}} IWW Local 20 {{decided to send}} to New York City for Joe Ettor, the organization's top Italian language leader, to come to Lawrence and lead the strike. Ettor arrived with Arturo Giovannitti, secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation, a language federation of the Socialist Party of America {{and editor of the}} socialist newspaper Il Proletario Proletarian, who was not himself at the time a member of the IWW. [...] Ettor instantly called on all his skills, including his ability to speak five languages, to rally the strikers. On his first afternoon in Lawrence, he addressed thousands of strikers, fostering solidarity and discouraging violence. [...] "All the blood that is spilled in a strike is your blood," [...] he told strikers. [...] Denouncing the mill owners, sympathizing with the toil of textile workers, Ettor called for an even larger walkout. [...] "Monday morning you have got to close the mills that you have caused to shut down, tighter than you have them now." [...] Ettor then set up fourteen strike committees based on nationality, and began meeting daily with everyone from the mayor of Lawrence to the various strikers in committee. Mill owners instantly recognized Ettor's power and tried to discredit him by planting <b>dynamite</b> in a <b>store</b> where he picked up his mail. But the plot was quickly detected and Ettor continued organizing the strike.|$|R
