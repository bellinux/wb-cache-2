This scenario makes the surge resist capability of processor type loads and the associated power conversion interfaces with lot of power semiconductors, seriously vulnerable to lightning and other power transients. In a major research project to predict the propagation of transients within the power conversion interfaces using wavelet transform, it was necessary to develop an experimental database of surge failures in power electronic subsystems.

40|$|Multimedia {{facilities}} are now becoming common-place on <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> <b>PC</b> systems. In order for such facilities {{to be of}} use to users {{it is important that}} software seamlessly integrates the different media types. Hypermedia is a technology that can enable users to browse through a corpus of multimedia information, and to make and follow links within this information. At the University of Southampton we have developed an open hypermedia system known as Microcosm, which provides a link service across a range of applications and media types. This paper describes the facilities available when dealing with textual information within Microcosm, and then examines the key issues which limit {{the extent to which these}} facilities may be extended to all media types. 1. Introduction Hypermedia is a technology that allows users to browse through large bodies of multimedia information by a range of link-following navigational techniques, and to create new links in the material so that a network of conceptu [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This seminar was {{delivered}} on 18 th April 2012 by Prof dr Peter Vink from {{the faculty of}} Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, where he guides 10 PhD students active {{in the field of}} interior design. He is also principle scientist at TNO (the second largest applied scientific research organization in Europe), where he specializes in leading research in design of work, work environments, interior design and work systems. In his group projects are carried out in the field of Participatory Ergonomics (how and who to involve in a design process), Comfort (hand tools, seats, vehicle interiors and improving working conditions) and Intelligent Manufacturing (developing simulation systems to improve the design of the organization and lay-out of assembly lines). Professor Vink has in excess of 200 publications in the field of interior design and has been a consulatant and advisor for companies including Boeing, BMW, Gispen and SNCF. The presentation was hosted at Brunel University as part of the Human Centred Design Institute (HCDI) Research Seminar Series. HCDI is a University Research Centre (URC) that brings together expertise in Human-centred Design which combines methodologies and technologies from design, engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence and philosophy. Human-centred Design leads to machines, systems and products which are physically, cognitively and emotionally intuitive to their users. The Human Centre Design seminar series are events designed to encourage communication and teamwork with colleagues across the university and experts leaders in human-centred related topics. The use of laptops and tablets is increasing. In 2008 more laptops than <b>desk</b> <b>tops</b> are sold and tablet sales is increasing as well. This has influence on the design of office and vehicle interiors. However, the ideal tablet office or laptop aircraft seat, which results in an optimal position and experience, is hard to establish as for reading, typing and touchscreen activities other positions are experienced as comfortable. These changes in work devices have their consequences for the interior. For instance, in the office the <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> is not often used. In using the current <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> <b>PC</b> the keyboard, mouse and screen can be placed on every position. The guidelines prescribe for instance the screen height and the keyboard position. For a notebook this is more difficult as the keyboard and mousepad are connected to the screen. Sometimes a docking station or seperate screens, mouses and keyboards are connected. Or a notebook standard with keyboard and mouse is used. In this case the work station can be designed in such a way the VDU guidelines are met. Using a tablet with a touchscreen the human body position is completely different. For a train, car or aircraft seat this device use has its consequences as well. In this presentation several devices and environmental designs will be shown, background information and effect studies will be presented showing consequences for seat and environment design...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of parallel platforms {{over the last}} ten years has been dramatic. Parallel platforms come in different flavors, including <b>desk</b> [...] <b>top</b> multiprocessor <b>PCs</b> and workstations with a few processors, networks of PCs and workstations, and supercomputers with hundreds of processors or more.

We show how PostScript rendering can be accelerated using a commercially available FPGA co-processor card. Our method relies on dynamically swapping in pre-computed circuits to accelerate the compute intensive portions of PostScript rendering e. g. drawing curves. We deploy a novel hardware description language which allows efficient utilisation of a limited FPGA resource. Experiments show that this technique could lead to a commerical viable FPGA co-processor for <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> publishing applications. We describe a run-time system for managing the FPGA and dynamic circuit resources.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s when these first <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> {{quotation}} units were developed {{the only real}} time information available from the various stock and commodity exchanges were the last sale and the bid and ask ticker lines. The last sale ticker contained every trade with both price and volume for each trade. The bid-ask ticker contained only the two prices and no size. The volume of data on the last sale ticker was therefore much greater than on the bid-ask ticker. Because of this, on high volume days the last sale ticker would run as much as fifteen minutes behind the bid-ask ticker. This time difference made having the bid-ask on their <b>desk</b> <b>top</b> unit extremely important to a stockbroker {{even though there was}} an extra charge to the exchange for this information.|$|R
