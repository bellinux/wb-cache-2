5|$|An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant {{spent four}} years {{collecting}} cinchona seeds in the Andes in Bolivia, highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865, the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the Cinchona ledgeriana in Java (Indonesia). By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Dutch had established a world monopoly over its supply.|$|E
5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole.

5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> most Russian churches {{from before}} the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected {{in the seventeenth century}} in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|The Gebelein predynastic mummies are six {{naturally}} mummified bodies, {{dating to}} approximately 3400BC from the Late Predynastic period of Ancient Egypt.

5|$|Until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Giffnock had no church buildings, and {{religious}} meetings {{took place in}} the waiting room of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock. Now a category B listed building, the Church is built in a Gothic revival style of architecture and is built mainly of locally quarried stone.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the {{majority}} of the city's population was Jewish. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (so around 63% percent). This heritage can be seen on the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok. The first Anarchist groups to attract a significant following of Russian workers or peasants, were the Anarcho-Communist Chernoe-Znamia groups, founded in Białystok in 1903. The Białystok pogrom occurred between 14–16 June 1906 in the city. During the pogrom between 81 and 88 people were killed, and about 80 people were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b> However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E

5|$|Where {{it lives}} {{alongside}} the blue wildebeest, {{the two species}} can hybridise, and this {{is regarded as a}} potential threat to the maintenance of the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds but by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b> During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation {{as a result of}} industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Charles II and his Cavalier {{supporters}} favoured a new army under royal control; {{and immediately}} after the Restoration began working on its establishment. The first English Army regiments, including elements of the disbanded New Model Army, were formed between November 1660 and January 1661 and became a standing military force for Britain (financed by Parliament). The Royal Scots and Irish Armies were financed by the parliaments of Scotland and Ireland. Parliamentary control was established by the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689, although the monarch continued to influence aspects of army administration until at least the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Baronial style peaked {{towards the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and the {{building}} of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890 he produced a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller (1864–1906) in the Adam style. The baronial style continued to influence the construction of some estate houses, including Skibo Castle, which was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell (1872–1935) designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store.|$|E
5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> when {{the importance of}} synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while {{in the heat of}} battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E

5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> {{the story of the}} origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of roof tiles, which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface. The source of the roof tiles is the port of Marseilles, France, and most were stamped with the heart-shaped emblem of the Roux Frères roof-tile factory. The roof tiles indicate that the building was erected at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> CE. Several other roof tiles were stamped with a swan symbol, these were probably imported in a later phase of the building’s existence, {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century, for the purpose of repair. According to Micah Linn of Mishmar HaEmek, the building was no longer standing at the time when the kibbuz was founded and therefore, it is estimated to have been in use for only several decades.|$|E
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E
