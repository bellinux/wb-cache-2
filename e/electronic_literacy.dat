40|$|While {{the last}} decade has been marked by {{widespread}} advocacy for integrating information and communication technologies (ICTs) across school curriculum, teachers' understandings of the nature of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacies</b> in the learning process have received far less attention. This has been the case despite the accelerated growth, miniaturisation and convergence of new media, all of which have accentuated the need for educators to understand how student learning in digital environments might be engaged and enhanced. In this paper, our focus is on how working with <b>electronic</b> <b>literacies</b> can open up new ways of learning in schools. We identify some key challenges and opportunities for designing classroom tasks to promote the development of effective digital learning through the construct of 'students-as-designers'. Further, we explore possible implications of this construct for the agency of teacher and student as both strive to use and create knowledge in digital contexts. No Full Tex...|$|R

This study was {{designed}} to (1) evaluate the effect of narratives used in a popular, publicly available patient decision aid for early-stage breast cancer on hypothetical treatment decisions and attitudes toward the decision aid and (2) explore the moderating effects of participant numeracy, <b>electronic</b> health <b>literacy</b> and decision-making style. Two hundred women were asked to imagine that they had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and viewed one of two versions of a video decision aid for early-stage breast cancer. The narrative version of the aid included stories from breast cancer survivors; the control version had no patient stories. After viewing the video decision aid, participants made a hypothetical treatment choice between lumpectomy with radiation and mastectomy, answered several questions about their decision, and evaluated the quality of the decision aid. Participants received $ 100 for completing the study. The two conditions differed in their motivations for the treatment decision and perceptions of the aid's trustworthiness and emotionality but showed no differences in preferences for surgical treatments or evaluations of the decision aid's quality. However, the impact of patient narratives was moderated by numeracy and <b>electronic</b> health <b>literacy.</b> Higher levels of numeracy were associated with decreased decisional confidence and lower ratings of trustworthiness for the decision aid in the narrative video condition but not in the control video condition. In contrast, higher levels of <b>electronic</b> health <b>literacy</b> were associated with increased decisional confidence and greater perceptions of trustworthiness and credibility of the decision aid in the narrative video condition but not the control video condition...|$|R

Since the 1990 s, educators {{have been using}} virtual interaction to bring their classes into contact with geographically distant partner classes to create opportunities for authentic communication, meaningful collaboration and first-hand experience of working and learning with partners from other cultural backgrounds. Online exchange projects of this nature {{can contribute to the}} development of learner autonomy, linguistic accuracy, intercultural awareness, intercultural skills and <b>electronic</b> <b>literacies.</b> OIE now has reached a stage where it is moving beyond individual classroom initiatives and is assuming a role as a major tool for internationalization, intercultural development and virtual mobility in universities around the globe. This volume reports qualitative and quantitative findings on the impact of OIE on universities in Europe and elsewhere and offers comprehensive guidance on using OIE at both pedagogical and technological levels. It provides theoretically informed accounts of OIEs relevant to researchers in computer-assisted language learning (CALL), computer-mediated communication or virtual education.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the teaching of multiliteracy in three middle school English as a Second Language Arts classrooms. The research question was: How are English learners (ELs) developing multiliteracy- defined as critical literacy, <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy,</b> and socio-cultural literacy, if at all, in middle school ESL Language Arts classrooms? Collected data consisted of classroom observations, transcribed teacher and focus student interviews; copies of teacher and student artifacts such as handouts and student notebooks. The findings of the study suggest that teachers did not teach all aspects of multiliteracy and the students seemed to be developing mostly <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy,</b> {{but not so much}} critical and socio-cultural literacy.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} is a Qualitative Case Study which investigates the <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> practices of one English teacher and two Grade 10 English classes in a Muslim High school outside of Johannesburg. This study seeks {{to find out}} what the forms of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> used in the classroom are and for what purposes these are used. It is also aimed at investigating how the students in the English classroom engage with these forms of electronic literacies and whether or not gender plays a role in their engagement. This study draws on work in New Literacy Studies, particularly theories of literacy as social practice, Multiliteracies and multimodality as well as current research in the field of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy.</b> Although there have been numerous studies in the fields of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> and digital literacy in developed contexts like the United Kingdom and Australia, there is a paucity of research in South Africa in the field and particularly in the area of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> in the English classroom. The main sources of data were: classroom observations from which field notes were created and group interviews with the students as well as an interview with the English teacher. The findings of this study reveal that being electronically literate in the English classroom means having access to sophisticated forms of technology not only inside the classroom but also outside as well as having a certain degree of fluency around computer use. The forms of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> used by the English teacher and the purposes for which they were used demonstrate his pedagogy in English and the social forces that shape the production of this pedagogy. The research shows an expansion of the teacher’s role in the English classroom as he is no longer only ‘a mediator of learning’ but a mediator of technology. The status of the text has also changed as the ‘disappearance’ of print-based texts from the classroom was noted with the foregrounding of visual texts and hypertexts. It was found that the students on the whole were engaged with the technology used in the classroom and expressed a preference for its integration into their lessons as opposed to the traditional ‘reading and writing’ practices. Additionally, students’ engagement did not vary according to gender...|$|E
40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, <b>electronic</b> <b>literacies</b> have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of corpus consultation as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that corpus consultation may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

The data show that <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy</b> practices provide authentic opportunities to use the language and support the development of a social network of Korean speakers, which results in greater sociopsychological attachment to the Korean language and culture.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of English, Washington State UniversityIn 1989, Gregory Ulmer {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} electracy to name the apparatus that will supplant literacy. After several decades of negotiation and development, electracy has produced an array of potential applications. Through analysis of existing research, pedagogical application, and theoretical reflection, this dissertation advances <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy,</b> or electracy, {{in the context of}} the multimodal composition classroom. As a means to inform the transition from literacy to electracy, I provide a series of models or "relays" that resist prescriptive or essentialized formulas and orient new applications of electracy. Most prominently, I use blues music as a relay. By holding a musical orientation to rhetorical studies I suggest an inventive new approach to the teaching and theorization of multimodal composition. This approach is not isolated to music, but is introduced in a way that allows other compositionists to invent electracy through the use of relays, which I believe functions as stepping-stones in the larger transition from literacy to electracy as an apparatus. More than a mere instrumental advancement of digital media, the movement from literacy to electracy also includes the institutions supporting technology as well as how notions of subjectivity are being reconfigured. Therefore, and in order to further contextualize the implication of electracy as an apparatus, I analyze emerging notions of collective selfhood particularly as they appear in hacker communities. While the technical skill of breaking into computer systems is part of this process, such hacker groups as "Anonymous" realize collective social mobilization within the Internet in a way that I argue has implications for emerging notions of <b>electronic</b> <b>literacy.</b> As a whole, this outlook develops electracy as a viable method in which to understand and to teach composition in the digital age.

40|$|IntroductionElectronic health (eHealth) {{strategies}} are evolving making {{it important to}} have valid scales to assess eHealth and health literacy. Item response theory methods, such as the Raschmeasurement model, are increasingly used for the psychometric evaluation of scales. This paper aims to examine the internal construct validity of an eHealth and health literacy scale using Rasch analysis in a population with moderate to high cardiovascular disease risk. MethodsThe first 397 participants of the CONNECT study completed the <b>electronic</b> health <b>Literacy</b> Scale (eHEALS) and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Overall Rasch model fit as well as five key psychometric properties were analysed: unidimensionality, response thresh-olds, targeting, differential item functioning and internal consistency. ResultsThe eHEALS had good overall model fit (χ 2 = 54. 8, p = 0. 06), ordered response thresholds, reasonable targeting and good internal consistency (person separation index (PSI) 0. 90). It did, however, appear to measure two constructs of eHealth literacy. The HLQ subscales(except subscale 5) did not fit the Rasch model (χ 2 : 18. 18 – 60. 60, p: 0. 00 – 0. 58) and had sub-optimal targeting for most subscales. Subscales 6 to 9 displayed disordered thresholds indi-cating participants had difficulty distinguishing between response options.

40|$|Beginning with a {{brief history}} of the {{synergistic}} relationship between technology and literacy, this article examines the need for redefining literacy beyond print-based communications. It suggests that literacy, in a computer-networked society, is not solely about reading the printed word, but rather, that it encompasses receiving and sending messages in a hypermedia format. It is noted that electronic communication not only includes printed text, but may also encompass pictorials, film grammars, and multi-sensory structures requiring semiological analysis. Discussion then moves to the characteristics of hypermedia, the hypertext network, and fundamental differences between types of hyperlinks. Key literacy codes inherent in electronic hypermedia text are compared with those fostered by print-based text.

Enabled by new, networked technology, e-commerce is rapidly becoming {{an integral part of}} the many different ways people and organizations do business and manage information. The Internet economy is expanding very rapidly and the pace of change is speeding up. While E-commerce is growing rapidly in the world, E-commerce in Lebanon is still in its embryonic stage. In fact, only 2 % of the population is online. This study is done in order to shed light on electronic commerce in the world and all the business models since its initiation till our days. But the most important is to analyze to what extent the Lebanese customers as well as the businesses accept the Internet as a means of doing business. A descriptive analysis is adopted to present the study results and analyze the findings in a way that enables the researcher objectives, which are the assessment of E-commerce implementation in Lebanon Data has been collected and acquired from three sources: secondary sources, and primary sources. The primary data are divided between a questionnaire analysis and a case study about a Lebanese online organization followed by an interview with Mrs. Rola Moussa, the manager. Another interview was also held with Dr. Salah Rustum, CEO of GlobalSign to shed light on electronic commerce in Lebanon as well as the security issues and digital signatures. The questionnaires were filled by students from (LAU), (AUB), (AUST), and (USJ) as well as Faculty from LAU. Employees came from a broad variety of organizations belonging to various sectors and from different managerial sectors and functional divisions such as banks, Medical Institution, and Trading Companies. More than two hundred and ten questionnaires were distributed to students and employees. Only one hundred fifty one questionnaires were filled and returned. That is, 72 % was the response rate. The analysis of data was done through the facilities of a statistical package of social science (SPSS) The concepts to be assessed are as follows: Internet <b>Literacy,</b> <b>Electronic</b> Commerce <b>Literacy,</b> and attitude toward electronic commerce. Lebanese users do accept all new technologies and electronic commerce is being accepted in a way or another by the educated people first and it will be widespread among the majority of the Lebanese users. Thus, implementing new education systems that enhance Internet literacy and reducing the cost of going online, will encourage the use of the Internet and consequently will increase Electronic commerce and its applications.

Preserving and providing intellectual access to visual records {{will become an}} increasingly important aspect of archival work as such materials proliferate and are widely available in <b>electronic</b> form. Visual <b>literacy,</b> an evolving concept best defined {{as the ability to}} understand and use images and to think and learn in terms of images, is an essential skill for archivists and researchers using visual materials. Archivists of all media should strive to increase their visual literacy because of the complex ways in which visual and "traditional" textual documents interrelate. Archivists can approach visual literacy by becoming familiar with levels of visual awareness; participating in the ongoing discourse about the nature of literacy, including the relationships between visual and textual literacy; and increasing understanding of the special characteristics of image-creating technologies as well as the conventions and modes of expression associated with particular media. Expanded visual literacy will help archivists to understand and better describe visual resources as well as traditional documents and other materials of record. The results, improved finding aids and catalog records, will keep pace with anticipated expanding requirements of the research community...|$|R
