5|$|Hepatitis: During the 1940s the cause, {{method of}} {{communication}} and treatment of <b>infectious</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was not well understood. Experimentation began with COs working at psychiatric hospitals and was expanded to a major research project with 30 to 60 test subjects at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The men were inoculated with infected blood plasma, swallowed nose and throat washings and the human body wastes of infected patients, and drank contaminated water.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{dispute about}} the cause of Beethoven's death; {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis, syphilis, <b>infectious</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> lead poisoning, sarcoidosis and Whipple's disease have all been proposed. In 2008, Austrian pathologist Christian Reiter asserted that Beethoven's doctor, Andreas Wawruch, accidentally killed the composer by giving him an overdose of a lead-based cure. According to Reiter, Wawruch used the cure to alleviate fluid in the abdomen; the lead penetrated Beethoven's liver and killed him. Reiter's hypothesis however {{is at odds with}} Dr. Wawruch's written instruction [...] "that the wound was kept dry all the time". Furthermore, human hair is a very bad biomarker for lead contamination, and Reiter's hypothesis must be considered dubious as long as proper scholarly documentation remains unpublished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Gnotobiotic puppies were inoculated intracerebrally with {{a strain}} of canine parainfluenza virus (CPI- 78 - 238). Four of eight dogs {{developed}} histological evidence of acute encephalitis. Clinical signs of encephalitis were seen in two of these four dogs; one had signs and lesions of interstitial pneumonia. Of six inoculated dogs observed for six months after infection, five developed internal hydrocephalus. Virus was reisolated from two dogs with acute encephalitis but not from dogs with hydrocephalus. Hemagglutination-inhibition anti-bodies persisted throughout the observation period of six months at high levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of hydrocephalic dogs. Infectious disease {{is the most common}} cause of neurological disorders in dogs [20]. Viruses known to cause encephalitis in dogs include canine distemper, rabies, <b>infectious</b> canine <b>hepatitis,</b> Aujeszky’s disease, and canine herpes infection in puppies. In <b>infectious</b> canine <b>hepatitis,</b> the infection develops rapidly and parenchymal lesions are minimal and limited to endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies.
