The focus here lies on sensor systems that give semi-quantitative, fuse-like information on the presence of harmful liquids, which indirectly gives evidence on the presence of structural damage. The common underlying principle is the interruption of percolation conductivity when the respective sensing material is exposed to harmful liquids; that is, the electrical conductivity is essentially lost by sorption and swelling of a dedicated matrix material. The temperature dependence and response times give valuable information on the usability of the sensor in the respective environments.

The P-V-T measurements were made via a variable-volume technique without using a confining liquid. The variable-volume design {{makes it possible to}} cover a range of specific volumes with a single charge, resulting in an efficient operating procedure. A unique bellows design with a 14 -fold volume variation was developed. The bellows contained the compound under study (CF 4) and was surrounded by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid</b> whose pressure could be varied causing the bellows to expand or contract. The volume of the bellows was determined by measuring the volume of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid.</b> Calibrations were made using a gas (CO 2) of known thermodynamic properties. Pressure measurements were made via a differential pressure transducer on three Heise gauges calibrated in place against a Ruska dead-weight tester. The bellows cell was maintained in a well-agitated bath whose temperature was measured by a platinum resistance thermometer. The data were taken by charging a known amount of the compound into the bellows and observing the pressure-volume relationship at a fixed bath temperature. At the end of a run, the charge was recovered, the amount recovered agreeing within 0. 01 % with the amount charged. The observed data were analyzed graphically on pressure-volume, pressure-temperature, and compressibility diagrams.

Deionized water, butanol, toluene and hexane were selected as probe fluids with water as the continuous phase. Cross-inlet microchannels of 200 μm ∗ 200 μm (Dh = 200 μm), 400 μm ∗ 400 μm (Dh = 400 μm), 600 μm ∗ 600 μm (Dh = 600 μm) and 600 μm ∗ 300 μm (Dh = 400 μm) {{as well as a}} T-inlet microchannel of 600 μm ∗ 300 μm (Dh = 400 μm) were tested. For the tests in the microchannels of Dh = 600 μm and 400 μm, the superficial velocities of the dispersed phase and continuous phase varied between 0. 3 mm/s and 12 mm/s and between 0. 2 mm/s and 50 mm/s, while in the microchannel of Dh = 200 μm the superficial velocities of the dispersed phase and continuous phase ranged from 0. 3 mm/s to 21 mm/s and from 0. 2 mm/s to 150 mm/s.

40|$|The {{dynamic of}} {{cavitation}} in hydraulic components cannot be computed accurately yet and therefore cavitation {{is hard to}} predict. The cavitation phenomenon can be divided in three sub-phenomenona: Pseudo-cavitation, Gas-cavitation and Vapour-cavitation. Pseudo-cavitation discribes the enlargement of an air bubble due to a pressure drop. Gas-cavitation refers to bubble growth which is driven by diffusion of dissolved air from the surrounding fluid into the bubble, when the solubility of air in the fluid is lowered by a pressure drop. Vapor-cavitation is the evaporation of the liquid phase on the bubble surface. Usually all three sub-phenomenona occur simultaneously when the pressure decreases and are summarised as cavitation in general.

40|$|Modern {{hydraulic}} systems should be monitored on the regular basis. One {{of the most}} effective ways to address this task is utilizing in-line automatic particle counters (APC) built inside of the system. The measurement of particle concentration in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid</b> by APC is crucial because increasing numbers of particles should mean functional problems. Existing automatic particle counters have significant limitation for the precise measurement of relatively low concentration of particle in aerospace systems or they are unable to measure higher concentration in industrial ones. Both issues can be addressed by implementation of the CMOS image sensor instead of single photodiode used in the most of APC. CMOS image sensor helps to overcome the problem of the errors in volume measurement caused by inequality of particle speed inside of tube. Correction is based on the determination of the particle position and parabolic velocity distribution profile. Proposed algorithms are also suitable for reducing the errors related to the particles matches in measurement volume. The results of simulation show that the accuracy increased up to 90 per cent and the resolution improved ten times more compared to the single photodiode sensor...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion {{for reducing the}} solid content of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) was compared using a conventional single pass reactor (SPR) and a two stage anaerobic-aerobic process. The first stage of the two stage system used an anaerobic hydraulic flush reactor (HFR) in which the solids and liquid retention times were decoupled by retention of solids within the system. The purpose of the hydraulic flush was to wash out rapidly the fermentation intermediates from the anaerobic reactor and thus prevent their accumulation; these were subsequently removed in the second stage aerobic activated sludge system, the effluent from which was then used as the flush liquor to the first stage. The hydraulic flush reactor was operated at <b>hydraulic</b> (<b>liquid)</b> retention times of 2, 3 and 4 days with solids retention times of 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 days.

At high loadings the SPR system showed an accumulation of volatile fatty acids, peaking at 13000 mg 1 - 1, which resulted in process failure and cessation of solids destruction.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem of}} dynamic impact of hoisting mechanisms, {{which are based on}} the multistage hydro-cylinders, on the hoisted object. Hydro-cylinders have high specific characteristics, but there are also some drawbacks. One of them is an impact at the beginning {{and at the end of}} hoist and in switching the stages. And in case of switching the stages under certain conditions the impact in nature can be a high impact impulse. The paper explores the impacts at the beginning of hoist and when switching the stages. Numerical modeling is assumed to be a method of study. To build a mathematical model the following factors have been considered: geometrical cylinder parameters, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid</b> compressibility, and friction between cylinder elements. Elasticity of ground, elasticity of rod, and elasticity of cylinder walls have been ignored. The modeling results allowed us to reveal a hydraulic nature of the stage-switching impact, introduce a formula to estimate the impact impulse value, show the friction effect on the impact impulse value and give a proposal to use a counter-pressure chamber to eliminate the stage-switching impact. An expression for the optimal counter-pressure is presented. The results obtained can find application in designing the new and upgrading the existing hoisting multistage hydro-cylinder mechanisms to increase a hoisting speed and simultaneously eliminate the impact on hoisted object. Compared to existing papers in the field concerned, this one concentrates on revealing a specific hydraulic nature of the stage-switching impact, without regard to dynamics and elasticity of the hoisting mechanism parts other than the cylinder itself. The achieved results find confirmation when compared to the numerical and field data published by other authors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are some}} of the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. They were used in plasticizers, varnishes, transformers, or as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid.</b> Their production and use has since been banned. Because of their longevity they still occur in the environment and are to be found in particular in fat-containing food of animal origin like milk, meat, eggs and fish. The European Commission is currently in the process of drawing up maximum level provisions for most PCBs, i. e. the so-called non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs). It envisages using as their representative the sum of six selected ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs) that frequently occur in food. BfR welcomes the fact that in the new proposal the maximum levels have been reduced for most foods and that fish liver and food for babies and infants has been included in the new proposal. One exception to this positive assessment is, however, the new maximum level for chicken eggs of 75 nanogram (ng) Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat which, in contrast to the first proposal of 50 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat, has been set at an incomprehensibly high level. The maximum level for eggs should be oriented towards the maximum level for poultry meat where 30 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat was established as the maximum level and this is more than 50 % lower, as the PCB contaminations in the fat portion of eggs and poultry meat are roughly the same. * In the opinion of BfR the proposed maximum levels for Σ 6 PCBs in food should, however, be lowered further. *After the preparation of this Opinion, this concern of BfR was presented to the European Commission (DG SANCO) with the consequence that the proposal for the maximum level for chicken eggs was reduced to 50 ng/g fat for Σ 6 PCB...|$|E
40|$|The tube {{hydroforming}} {{process is}} still {{to be considered a}} new and advanced technique. The process has been adopted into several industries, e. g. automotive and aero. A tube that has been cut to appropriate length, and by bending or crushing often been preformed, is placed in a die. The tube is filled with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>liquid</b> and the ends are closed by side cylinders that press against the ends, creating an axial force in the tube. Simultaneously, the liquid is pressurized and the material of the tube yields and flows into the die cavities. The part is formed. In simulations of forming processes, users prescribe the fluid pressure in the work piece and the axial load exerted by the cylinders. Nowadays, many simulations must be performed, trial-and-error, to find appropriate loading paths for the pressure and the axial load. A more effective technique would be that the simulation program itself generates the pressure and the axial load. Depending on the magnitude and the proportionality between the pressure and the axial load, the tube fails either by rupture or wrinkling. In between these two failure boundaries there is a safe area, a process window, where the simulation yields useful results. An adaptive loading procedure would react to the boundaries and change the pressure and axial load accordingly to avoid failure. Today, the preferable virtual verification tool for tube hydroforming processes is the explicit finite element method. The economical cost of simulations by explicit time integration methods is directly proportional to the computational time. It is desirable to prescribe the simulation time to be as short as possible. Till now, program users have set a very high simulation time to avoid the problem with shorter simulation times - unreliable results due to dynamic effects. An easy way of defining the limit of the simulation time when it goes from reliable results to unreliable would be desirable. A part of the process window is established for different simulation times. It is shown that the simulation results changes abruptly at a certain value of the simulation time. Also, adaptive loading algorithms, the process window and the simulation time problem are investigated. A thorough literature survey is carried out in the tube hydroforming area.
