50|$|MOOSE is a {{development}} and run-time {{environment for the}} solution of multi-physics systems that involve multiple physical models or multiple simultaneous physical phenomena. The systems are generally represented (modeled) as a system of fully coupled nonlinear partial differential equation systems (an example of a multi-physics system is the thermal feedback effect upon neutronics cross-sections where the cross-sections are {{a function of the}} heat transfer). Inside MOOSE, the Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method is implemented as a parallel nonlinear solver that naturally supports effective coupling between physics equation systems (or Kernels). The physics Kernels are designed to contribute to the nonlinear residual, which is then minimized inside of MOOSE. MOOSE provides a comprehensive set of finite <b>element</b> <b>support</b> capabilities (libMesh) and provides for mesh adaptation and parallel execution. The framework heavily leverages software libraries from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), such as the nonlinear solver capabilities in either the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) project or the Trilinos project.|$|E

40|$|We {{reported}} {{in our previous}} work that the EDEN-dependent translational repression of maternal mRNAs was conserved between Drosophila and Xenopus. In Xenopus, this repression is achieved through the binding of EDEN to the Bruno-like factor, EDEN-BP. We show in the present work that the Drosophila Bruno paralogue, the 45 kDa Bru- 3 protein (p 45), binds specifically to the EDEN element and acts as a homodimer. We describe {{for the first time}} a previously undetected 67 amino acid domain, found in the divergent linker region, the lsm domain (lsm stands for linker-specific motif). We propose that the presence of this domain in a subset of the Bruno-like proteins, including Bru- 3, EDEN-BP and CUG-BP but not Bruno nor its other paralogue Bru- 2, might be responsible for specific RNA recognition. Interestingly, comparative structural analyses using threaders and molecular modelling suggest that the new domain might be distantly related to the first RNA recognition motif of the Drosophila sex-lethal protein (sxl).

40|$|We have cloned the B {{breakpoint}} in Drosophila melanogaster using DNA from a P-M-induced revertant of B, {{which has}} a P element inserted at the B breakpoint.

40|$|We analyze a spatiotemporal dataset {{describing}} the use over {{time of the}} mobile-phone network in the urban area of Milan, Italy. This dataset contains 13. 8 million records referenced in space over a regular lattice of 10573 pixels at a spatial resolution of nearly 250 m covering an area of 757 km^ 2, and referenced in time over a regular grid of 1308 intervals at a temporal resolution of 15 minutes covering {{a period of two}} weeks. The database has been provided by Telecom Italia Mobile. Aim of the analysis is the identification of spatiotemporal patterns characterizing specific locations and/or specific periods possibly associated to different activities taking place within the city. This research is part of the Green Move Project, a research project held at Politecnico di Milano and funded by Regione Lombardia investigating the potential of a third-generation car-sharing system within the city of Milan. We analyze these data by means of a newly developed methodology: Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis (HICA). HICA is based on a recursive hierarchical application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on pairs of variables. The final output of HICA is a multi-resolution, wavelet-inspired, and data-driven basis useful to represent data and to investigate their sources of variability. Differently from ICA and similarly to wavelets, the basis provided by HICA is naturally ordered according to the dimension of each basis <b>element</b> <b>support.</b> Moreover, not just one basis is provided but an entire family of bases is available that is characterized by an increasing level of resolution. The possibility of choosing different levels of resolution is critical from a practical point of view, because it allows the investigator to impose a different grade of sparsity to the basis. Similarly to ICA, the basis provided by HICA, is not orthogonal and driven by the search for independent components. Thus differently from all principal-component inspired methods no purely mathematical (and possibly unrealistic) constraint is imposed to the final basis. We proved two theorems in support of this new methodology. The first one is a consistency result of the algorithm. Indeed we proved that if just K independent components are present acting on different sets of variables and the noise variability is below a certain threshold, HICA detects those K components. The second result characterizes, in the same framework, the behavior of the fraction of explained total variance as the level resolution and the dimension of the optimal basis is varying. This result provides the investigator with practical guidelines about the choice of the more suited level of resolution and the more proper dimension of the final basis. Data have been analyzed in a double perspective: (i) sites are assumed to index variables while instants of times to index instances (this approach is common in the Blind Source Separation literature), and (ii) instants of times are assumed to index variables while sites to index instances (this approach is common in the Geo-statistical literature). The declination of HICA in the two approaches allows us to impose spatial sparsity or temporal sparsity, respectively, to the final representation. Both approaches unveil interesting patterns interpretable in terms of working, residential, shopping, leisure, and commuting activities...|$|E
40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide {{viscous damping}} to {{attenuate}} excessive vibrations and enhance system stability in turbomachinery. SFDs are of special importance in aircraft engines which use rolling <b>element</b> <b>support</b> bearings that, by themselves, {{do not provide}} enough damping to ensure safe operation. A modular test rig capable of simulating actual operating conditions in aircraft jet engines is used to test two centrally grooved, end sealed, SFDs. Both SFDs have diameter D and nominal radial clearance c and consist of two parallel squeeze film lands separated by a deep circumferential groove of length LG and depth dG. A short length damper with film land lengths L and a long damper with land lengths 2 L are tested. Piston rings seal the damper lands. An ISO VG 2 lubricant is supplied to the SFD via three radial holes that discharge lubricant into the central groove. The lubricant passes through the damper lands and across the piston ring seals to finally exit the damper at ambient pressure. Circular orbit tests of amplitude ~ 0. 5 c and for static eccentricities varying from 0 to ~ 0. 36 c are conducted on the two sealed dampers. The instrumental variable filter method (IVFM) serves to identify the SFD dynamic force coefficients. The parameter identification range is 50 Hz to 210 Hz for the short damper and 110 Hz to 250 Hz for the long damper. Large amplitude dynamic pressures measured in the central groove demonstrate that the central groove does not divide the damper in two separate film lands, but the lubricant in the groove interacts with the squeeze film lands, hence contributing significantly to the SFD forced response. Dynamic pressures in the film lands and in the central groove reveal that both dampers operate free of air ingestion or cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. Comparisons to test results for the same SFD configurations but with open ends demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} end seals on increasing the direct damping coefficients. For the sealed ends short length damper, the added mass coefficients are ~ 2 times larger and the damping coefficients are ~ 3. 8 times larger than the respective coefficients of the open ends long damper. For the sealed ends long damper, the damping coefficients are ~ 2. 8 times, and the added mass coefficients are ~ 3. 1 times larger than coefficients from the open ends configuration. The identified SFD direct stiffness coefficients are nearly zero except at the maximum static eccentricity for the long damper. Predictions from a novel computational model that include the effects of the central groove, the lubricant feed holes and the end seals are in excellent agreement with results from the short length damper. For the long damper, the predicted damping coefficients are in good agreement with the test results, while the added mass coefficients are under predicted by ~ 25 percent. Experimental results from the two sealed SFD configurations lead {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of end seals as well as central feed groves on the SFD forced performance. The results presented in this thesis will help improve the effectiveness of SFDs aircraft jet engines...|$|E
