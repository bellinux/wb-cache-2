40|$|Membrane fusion {{induced by}} {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) {{requires}} the action of four viral membrane glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH, and gL) and the binding of gD to one of its receptors, such as the herpesvirus entry mediator or nectin- 1. The related animal herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), encodes a homologous set of glycoproteins and its gD can also use nectin- 1 as an entry receptor. We show here that PRV gD, when coexpressed with HSV gB, gH, and gL, cannot substitute for HSV gD in inducing fusion with target cells expressing nectin- 1. Chimeric gD molecules composed of HSV and PRV sequences can substitute, provided the first 285 aa are from HSV gD. Because the first 261 aa were sufficient for receptor binding, this suggested that amino acids 262 – 285 contain a region required for cell fusion but not for receptor binding. Deletions from amino acids 250 – 299 failed to identify a specific subregion critical for cell fusion, except possibly for amino acids 250 – 255, which also influenced receptor binding. Instead, presence of a <b>flexible</b> <b>stalk</b> between the membrane and receptor-binding domain appears to be required, perhaps to enable conformational changes in gD on receptor binding and subsequent interactions of undefined regions of gD with the other glycoproteins required for membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|Rotational motions play {{important}} roles within biological processes. These motions can drive energy production {{as with the}} F 1 -ATP synthase or accompany domain motions during a conformational change such as the relative rotation of the large and small ribosomal subunits during protein synthesis. Studying these motions can {{provide insight into the}} mechanics of enzyme function that cannot be obtained by measuring its localization or chemical output alone. Rotational tracking can be done in the context of single molecule studies to observe enzymatic function at the single particle level. This presents an advantage over bulk solution studies because simultaneously occurring events, such as a solution of enzymes catalyzing a reaction, are not necessarily identical. By measuring the motions of a single molecule, short-lived states and rare events that would otherwise be averaged out can be detected. Here single molecule rotational tracking is utilized to examine the stepping mechanism of the cellular transport motor, cytoplasmic dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein walks along microtubules toward the minus end and is responsible {{for a wide range of}} cellular functions including cargo transport and chromosome alignment during cell division. This work employs a position and rotational tracking method, polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (polTIRF) microscopy. This technique requires a polarized fluorescent probe that is rigidly attached to the protein domain of interest and an optical system capable of measuring the orientation of such a probe. A functionalization method was developed to water-solubilize CdSe/CdS semiconductor quantum nanorods, which have polarized fluorescence emission, and coat them with the biotin binding protein, NeutrAvidin, in order to attach them to biotinylation sites within the dynein ring. A method was also developed to quantify the number and density of functional biotin binding sites on the nanorod surface and compare it to that of commercially available streptavidin quantum dots. These nanorods were attached to cytoplasmic dynein via two inserted biotinylation sites in AAA 5 and AAA 6 of the ring domain and rotational motions of the dynein ring were measured in real time using a home-built optical system capable of measuring both position and orientation simultaneously. These measurements revealed small, frequent ring rotations that occurred more than twice as frequently as steps along the microtubule track. The observed ring rotations are too small to be attributed to a classic powerstroke mechanism in which large-scale tilting produces forward motion, but instead support a <b>flexible</b> <b>stalk</b> model where tension between the two dynein heads, produced by conformational changes of the linker domain, results in bending of the flexible coiled-coil stalk and hinging at the microtubule binding domain. ...|$|E

500|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a thin cuticle, an epidermis consisting of a single layer of cells, a thick dermis formed of connective tissue and a thin coelomic myoepithelial layer, which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature. The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate components known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures composed of calcite microcrystals arranged in a lattice. They vary in form, with some bearing external granules, tubercles and spines, but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a tessellated manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface. [...] Some are specialised structures such as the madreporite (the entrance to the water vascular system), pedicellariae and paxillae. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on <b>flexible</b> <b>stalks</b> in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements. They often form clusters surrounding spines. Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment. The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected. All the ossicles, including those projecting externally, are covered by the epidermal layer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} energy harvesting {{of a system}} formed by an array of identical artificial <b>flexible</b> <b>stalks</b> connected by equal axial springs. The stalks are excited in bending by the propagating eddies produced by a mixing layer airflow at the top end of the canopy. The energy harvesting is localised in one pivotal stalk, which {{is equipped with a}} harvester. The paper first contrasts the spectra of the energy harvested by this system and by a classical system, formed by an equal array of mechanically uncoupled beams, which are all equipped with harvesters. Since the proposed system forms a periodic structure, this analysis considers variations of the stiffness of the harvesting stalk and of the connecting springs, which may lead to natural frequencies veering and mode localisation effects. Finally, the paper presents a parametric study that highlights how the bending stiffness of the harvesting stalk, the axial stiffness of the connecting springs and the energy absorption coefficient of the harvester influence the energy extraction. The study shows that, particularly in presence of strongly correlated drag force excitations produced on the stalks by the airflow, the energy harvested with the proposed system with a single harvester is comparable to that of a more complex and more expensive system formed by a whole array of harvesters...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} that ribosomes of seedling roots of maize (Zea mays L.) contain the acidic phosphoproteins (P-proteins) known {{to form a}} <b>flexible</b> lateral <b>stalk</b> structure of the 60 S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. The P-protein stalk, composed of P 0, P 1, and P 2, interacts with elongation factors, mRNA, and tRNA during translation. Acidic proteins of 13 to 15. 5 kD were released as a complex from ribosomes with 0. 4 M NH 4 Cl/ 50 % ethanol. Protein and cDNA sequence analysis confirmed that maize ribosomes contain one type of P 1, two types of P 2, and a fourth and novel P 1 /P 2 -type protein. This novel P-protein, designated P 3, has the conserved C terminus of P 1 and P 2. P 1, P 2, and P 3 are similar in deduced mass (11. 4 - 12. 2 kD) and isoelectric point (4. 1 - 4. 3). A 35. 5 - to 36 -kD acidic protein was released at low levels from ribosomes with 1. 0 M NH 4 Cl/ 50 % ethanol and identified as P 0. Labeling of roots with [32 P]inorganic phosphate confirmed the in vivo phosphorylation of the P-proteins. Flooding caused dynamic changes in the P-protein complex, which affected the potential of ribosome-associated kinases and casein kinase II to phosphorylate the P-proteins. We discuss possible alterations of the ribosomal P-protein complex and consider that these changes {{may be involved in}} the selective translation of mRNA in flooded roots...|$|R

40|$|Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} large {{granular}} lymphocytes of the {{innate immune system}} that spontaneously kill foreign, tumor and virus-infected cells without prior sensitization. In addition, NK cells act as immune regulators by secretion of chemokines and cytokines as well as direct interaction with other immune cells such as dendritic cells. NK cell function is regulated by a balance between inhibitory and activating signals that are transduced into the cell upon target cell interaction. One of the major activating NK cell receptors is the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp 30. Notably, NKp 30 plays a unique role {{since it is the}} only NK cell receptor involved in triggering NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as shaping the adaptive immune response. Reduced NKp 30 expression has clinical implications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, cervical cancer, and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions as well as gastrointestinal sarcoma. Furthermore, downregulation of NKp 30 expression resulted in an impaired natural cytotoxicity against leukemia cells and was directly correlated with reduced survival. NKp 30 is a type I transmembrane protein of approximately 30 kDa comprised of an I-type Ig-like ligand binding domain (LBD), a <b>flexible</b> membrane proximal <b>stalk</b> domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytosolic tail. For intracellular signal transduction, NKp 30 associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) -bearing adaptor molecule CD 3 zeta via oppositely charged amino acid residues within their transmembrane domains. In 2011, the 3 D structure of the NKp 30 LBD was solved in an unbound and a ligand-bound form. However, so far, only few cellular ligands (BAG- 6 and B 7 -H 6) have been discovered, and the molecular details of ligand recognition by NKp 30 are poorly understood. Recently, it was shown that the membrane proximal stalk domain of NKp 30 is important for efficient ligand binding and signaling with respect to its length and amino acid composition. Additionally, it was demonstrated that proper N-linked glycosylation of the ligand binding domain is essential for ligand binding. But it is still vague, how this germline-encoded receptor is able to recognize multiple nonrelated ligands. Interestingly, a crystallographic dimer of the NKp 30 ectodomain was observed arguing for potential intrinsic capability to self-assemble. Moreover, a fraction of NKp 30 expressed in E. coli forms oligomers as detected by size exclusion chromatography. The aim of this thesis was to identify structural models and mechanisms, which enable variations of the ligand binding interface of NKp 30 to recognize a multiplicity of diverse ligands. In this respect, soluble NKp 30 ectodomain variants as well as an anti-NKp 30 antibody specifically recognizing an epitope within the LBD of NKp 30 were generated for molecular and cellular investigation to address the intrinsic ability of NKp 30 to form oligomers, which might impact ligand binding affinity and the efficiency of target cell killing by NK cells. In this thesis, it was demonstrated that baculovirus-infected insect cells were a suitable expression system to produce correctly folded, post-translationally modified and ligand binding-receptive NKp 30 proteins, which were functionally equivalent to those derived from human expression hosts. Furthermore, a polyclonal anti-NKp 30 antibody, which is specific for an epitope located within the NKp 30 LBD, was purified from the blood serum of a peptide-immunized rabbit and validated for several molecular and cellular applications. Based on soluble NKp 30 proteins comprising either the entire NKp 30 ectodomain (LBD and stalk domain) or the ligand binding domain alone, a concentration-dependent formation of NKp 30 ectodomain homo-oligomers was found, which was effected by two specific binding sites, one present within the Ig domain of NKp 30 and one within its membrane proximal stalk domain. Moreover, both NKp 30 ectodomain variant oligomers were functional in ligand binding and contributed to a highaffinity interaction with its cellular ligand B 7 -H 6, which was strongly promoted by the stalk domain. Although both NKp 30 ectodomain variant oligomers formed spherical particles of the same diameter in solution, in presence of the stalk domain one oligomer was composed of more monomers. Single particle electron microscopy analyses revealed that the number of calculated 2 D classes increased tremendously for the particles of the longer NKp 30 ectodomain variant. Therefore, a densest packing of spheres for the monomers within both NKp 30 ectodomain variant oligomers is suggested, whereas the flexibility of the stalk domain might allow for a more variable orientation of these monomers within the particle, thereby increasing the heterogeneity of structural arrangements. However, based on decoration experiments with soluble NKp 30 ectodomain proteins and primary NK cells facilitating more physiological conditions for NKp 30 self-assembly, an ordered arrangement of several NKp 30 receptors on the plasma membrane in head-to-head orientation is proposed. Based on these data, oligomerization of the NKp 30 ectodomain represents a potent mechanism to modulate the ligand binding affinity of NKp 30 for corresponding ligands by increased avidity. Because the degree of oligomerization is dependent on the local receptor concentration, which is upregulated by IL- 2 upon NK cell activation, oligomerization of NKp 30 might be a molecular transformer of NK cell activation into enhanced cytotoxicity. Future experiments are now focused to investigate NKp 30 self-assembly on the plasma membrane of NK cells to enable modulation of the cytotoxicity of NK cell based therapeutics...|$|R
