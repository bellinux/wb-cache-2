5|$|The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> in 1912.|$|E

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, {{a shortage}} of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E

5|$|At this point, time {{appeared}} to be on Trunajaya's side, as further delay {{would allow him to}} strengthen his fortifications and reinforcements, while disease would weaken the VOC's forces. Therefore, Speelman decided to attack. On 12–13 May, the VOC delivered a heavy artillery bombardment on Trunajaya's main works, followed by an assault. The attack succeeded after hard fighting, and Trunajaya retreated inland to establish his new capital at Kediri, capital city of the ancient Kediri Kingdom. In the retreat, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> sixty-nine iron cannons and thirty-four bronze cannons (twenty of them small ships' cannons, bassen) and only saved twenty bronze pieces.|$|E
5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind,</b> and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote more}} time to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E
50|$|An elderly dollmaker is {{hard at work}} in his shop.

Polanski can be glimpsed in a cameo role as a passer-by outside the shop.|$|R

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Cowan later {{worked as}} a {{physiotherapist}} for cricket club Sussex CCC and ice hockey team Brighton Tigers. As a trainer with the Tigers he was named in the British National League All Star team for three years running from 1956 to 1958. He died on 4 October 1964 aged 63, when he suffered a heart attack, while refereeing a football charity match in aid of Sussex wicket keeper Jim Parks. <b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> a widow and one son. In 2004, {{he was elected to}} Manchester City's Hall of Fame. A street near Manchester City's former ground Maine Road, Sam Cowan Close, is named in his honour.|$|E

5|$|England {{opened the}} year of 1966 on 5 January with a 1–1 draw with Poland at Goodison Park; Ramsey's {{managerial}} ability was demonstrated during the game as the equalising goal came from Bobby Moore, who was allowed to surge forward as Charlton covered the gap <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in defence. Charlton played in six of the next seven international victories as England prepared for the World Cup. The run started with impressive victories over West Germany and then Scotland in front of 133,000 fans at Hampden Park. He scored his first international goal with a deflected shot on 26 June, as England recorded a 3–0 victory over Finland at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. He missed the match against Norway but returned to action with a headed goal in a 2–0 win over Denmark at Idrætsparken.|$|E
5|$|His {{final years}} {{were marked by}} poor health. Several weeks before his death, McAleer was {{admitted}} to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved. This account, however, {{differs from that of}} baseball historian David Fleitz, who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s. In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private funeral services at Orr's funeral home, McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side. Apart from his widow, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> two brothers, J.C. McAleer of Austintown, Ohio, and Owen McAleer of Los Angeles. Other survivors included two nephews, Captain Charlies McAleer, an officer in the U.S. Army, and James McAleer of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls <b>He</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
