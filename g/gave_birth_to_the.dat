5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence.

Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
