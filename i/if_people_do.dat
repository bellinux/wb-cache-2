A discerning person is like a poor money-changer.

2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E

I don't say I don't believe in 'em; I only say I never met any of 'em. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> you a {{kindness}} it's generally {{because they want to}} get something out of you; same as a man once--a perfick stranger--wot stood me eight 'arf-pints becos I reminded 'im of his dead brother, and then borrered five bob off of me.|$|E

I shall do well enough, and so will my husband.

60|$|When the {{production}} of a commodity is the effect of labor and expenditure, whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited multiplication or not, there is a minimum value which is the essential condition of its being permanently produced. The value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand, and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the existing supply. But unless that value is sufficient to repay the Cost of Production, and to afford, besides, the ordinary expectation of profit, the commodity will not continue to be produced. Capitalists will not go on permanently producing at a loss. When such profit is evidently not to be had, <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not actually withdraw their capital, they at least abstain from replacing it when consumed. The cost of production, together with the ordinary profit, may, therefore, be called the necessary price or value of all things made by labor and capital. Nobody willingly produces in the prospect of loss.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some people {{imagine that}} there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. 'But how can it be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?' I {{immediately}} saw that there could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the saloon.' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see, <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling." ...|$|E

"When a man {{engages in}} the {{commission}} of a crime," [...] adds the mother, [...] "he {{runs the risk of}} all the perils that he exposes himself to, from the efforts of people to defend their property, and perhaps their lives; so that, perhaps, he would have no right to complain <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> shoot at him." ...|$|R

60|$|Next Sunday {{morning the}} vicar preached, and Walter sat {{looking up at}} him reflectively from his place in the chancel. A {{beautiful}} clear-cut face, the curate's, and seen to great advantage from the doctor's pew, set off by the white surplice, and upturned in quiet meditation towards the elder priest in the pulpit. Walter was revolving many things in his mind, and most of all one adverse chance which he could not just then see his way to minimize. Any day his uncle might take it into his head to read over the will and discover the--ah, well, the rectification. Walter was a man of too much delicacy of feeling even to think of it to himself as a fraud or a forgery. Then, again, the vicar was not a very old man after all; he might live for an indefinite period, and Christina and himself might lose all the best years of their life waiting for a useless person's natural removal. What a pity that threescore was not the utmost limit of human life! For his own part, like the Psalmist, Walter had no desire to outlive his own highest tastes and powers of enjoyment. Ah, well, well, man's prerogative is to better and improve upon nature. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not die when they ought, then it becomes clearly necessary for philosophically minded juniors to help them on their way artificially.|$|E

50|$|Inspired by both millennialist visionary Eugene Vintras and {{the reports}} of an {{apparition}} at La Salette—Our Lady of La Salette—Bloy {{was convinced that the}} Virgin's message was that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not reform, the end time was imminent.

50|$|The {{following}} season saw Veria relegated from Beta Ethniki to Gamma Ethniki again, {{after being}} docked by three points when Arvanitidis {{had a fight}} with the referee during a match against Ilisiakos, accusing him for being suborn, something that it was never proved. Arvanitidis again threatened to leave the club <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not stop blaming him for the team's relegation. At {{the end of the}} season almost every player was released.|$|R
50|$|The gnomes of the Campine were helpful {{creatures who}} helped mostly the farmers and the {{households}} in the Campine {{and also in the}} neighboring lands of the Peel and the Meierij.

50|$|A {{mechanism}} {{of social control}} occurs {{through the use of}} selective incentives.
