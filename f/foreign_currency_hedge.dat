We establish economically relevant short-run and long-run demand for stocks in several emerging market economies, for both domestic and international investors. From a welfare perspective, however, the myopic demand for emerging-market stocks {{is much more important}} than the hedging demand.

This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the effectiveness of the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> abilities afforded by the futures market. The focus is on the currencies of six emerging markets, namely; Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Turkey. By examining emerging market currencies we can examine the effect that possible mispricing and lack of liquidity can have on hedging effectiveness. To this effect, this article uses the regression method, as allowed by the accounting standard FAS 133, to assess the effectiveness of futures contracts as a hedging mechanism for emerging market currencies. The methods follow previous studies such as Hill and Schneeweis (1982) which consider the length of the hedging horizon and time to expiration due to their effect on hedge effectiveness. Results indicate consistent hedge effectiveness in only South Africa and Turkey, with reasonable hedge effectiveness exhibited by Mexico and Russia.

Indian Rupee was very volatile {{during the past decade}} due to global events like US subprime crisis (2007 - 2009), European sovereign debt crisis, Oil prices fluctuations and Fed monetary policy speculations to name few. This volatility has put pressure on Indian firms to manage their <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposure. <b>Hedging</b> and use of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Derivatives (FCD) is the preferred way of hedging forex risk. This paper tries to find out how the use of hedging impacts Indian firms value. Data for 129 top Indian non-financial companies for the period of 2008 to 2014 is collected from their annual reports and Datastream database. Approximately 800 annual reports were analyzed to get derivative and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> use data of these firms. Univariate and multivariate analysis is carried out to check impact of hedging on firm’s value in different settings. Control variables are used in multivariate analysis to check effect of other parameters on firm’s value. OLS regression finds that hedging has positive impact on firms’ value. This result is robust if samples are divided based on foreign sales or asset wise. Analysis done for financial crisis period (2007 - 2009) also shows positive effect of hedging with analysis done on post crisis period (2010 - 2014) which also shows value creation by hedging.

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{has been the}} subject of numerous theoretical and empirical researches. With the continuing integration of the world economy, multinational and trading firms are no longer alone in their exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates can cause uncertainty regarding the expected earnings of the firms. All these factors have contributed to the increased importance of foreign exchange risk management. The major objective of risk management is to maximize the value of the firm. This value is at risk to the extent that it fluctuates in response to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Previous researches in different literature showed that one of the most important aims of risk management is to provide smooth earnings. That means that managers would prefer to bring the current year’s earnings in line with the previous earnings. One of the method by which firms can achieve smooth earnings is hedging by using derivatives. Therefore, this paper is primary focused on the use of the derivatives to minimize the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on reported earnings. By using simulation, it explores how use of accounting choices can influence whether the use of foreign exchange derivatives will increase or decrease firm earnings volatility. risk management, <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> risk, <b>hedge</b> accounting, IAS 39...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on the convenience of <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> of international portfolio investments has not reached a final verdict.

40|$|The bachelor´s thesis {{examines}} the gains from <b>hedging</b> the <b>currency</b> exposure from {{the perspectives of}} American and Canadian investors. It is shown that exchange rate risk is a largely nondiversifiable factor which might negatively affect the performance of equity portfolios. Therefore, it is necassary to effectively control the exchange rate risk. It is found that the effect of currency risk on total portfolio risk varies among different currency pairs depending predominantly on the correlation between equity and currency returns. For this reason, it is essential to choose a different approach for each <b>currency</b> pair. The <b>hedging</b> strategy, which is refered to as optimal <b>currency</b> <b>hedging,</b> aims at minimizing the volatility of <b>currency</b> <b>hedged</b> portfolio returns. The optimal hedge ratios for individual currencies are also estimated. Over the period from 2004 to 2015, <b>hedging</b> the <b>currency</b> exposure considerably reduced the volatility of returns in the case of American investor. From the perspective of Canadian investor, <b>hedging</b> the <b>currency</b> risk reduced the volatility of returns only to a limited degree.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} an {{import demand}} function for the euro area vis [...] vis its main extra-area trading partners which {{takes into account}} the possible impact of both intra- and extra-euro area exchange rate uncertainty. We derive a theoretical model which captures various mechanisms by which exchange rate volatility may influence the demand for extra-euro area imports. If importers are risk averse, the model predicts not only a negative effect of exchange rate volatility, but also substitution possibilities between extra- and intra-area imports due to differences in the degree of extra- and intra-area exchange rate volatility. The magnitude of these impacts also depends on the share of trade invoiced in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (and not <b>hedged)</b> as well as the degree of substitutability between the imports of different suppliers. Using quarterly data for the past eleven years, panel estimates suggest that extra-area exchange rate volatility may have decreased extra-euro area imports by around 10 per cent. Although such quantitative estimates should be treated with caution, the magnitude of our estimate is similar to other studies which find a statistically significant impact of exchange rate volatility on trade flows. Finally, we also provide some limited evidence that differences in extra- and intra-area exchange rate volatility may have resulted in substitution between extra- and intra-area imports.
