5|$|In 1968 Franco-Caribbean writer Aimé Césaire {{published}} Une Tempête, {{a radical}} {{adaptation of the}} play based on its colonial and postcolonial interpretations, in which Caliban is a black rebel and Ariel is mixed-race. The figure of Caliban influenced numerous works of African literature in the 1970s, including pieces by Taban Lo Liyong in Uganda, Lemuel Johnson in Sierra Leone, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in Kenya, and David Wallace of Zambia's <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Me,</b> Master?. A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy. Other writers have feminised Ariel (as in Marina Warner's novel Indigo) or Caliban (as in Suniti Namjoshi's sequence of poems Snapshots of Caliban).|$|E

[...] The use of the homonym [...] "who do" [...] is an allusion to [...] "hoodoo", a Louisiana/Mississippi folk magic belief that events can be {{influenced}} by its use. [...] However, Bo Diddley uses imagery more common to the American Southwest, combined with exaggerated bravado. [...] He explained that the first line, [...] "I got forty-seven miles of barbed wire", came to him quickly, [...] "but I couldn't get a rhyme for it. [...] I thought of car tires and mule trains, and I couldn't get anything to fit. [...] Then one day I said 'use a cobra snake,' and my drummer, Clifton James, added 'for a necktie'". [...] These are directed at a female he is trying to woo – [...] "who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> <b>me</b> or him". [...] The lyrics confirm the effect: [...] "Arlene took me by my hand, she said 'oo-ee daddy I understand', who do you love?".|$|E

A commercially successful production, O'Hara {{described it as}} a [...] "rip-your-heart-out tearjerker that reduced my agents and the toughest brass at Fox to mush when they saw it". Critically it was poorly received, and was later declared by Harvard as the worst film of all time. One critic attacked O'Hara with saying [...] "just another one of those precious Hollywood juvenile products who in workday life would benefit from a good hiding", while Bosley Crowther dismissed the film was a [...] "compound of hackneyed situations, maudlin dialogue and preposterously bad acting". In Gregory Ratoff's musical <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Me,</b> O'Hara portrayed a prim, bespectacled music school dean who transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady in the big city. She commented that it was [...] "one of the worst pictures I ever made". It frustrated her that she could not put her talents to good use, to not even sing in it.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Cronjager left Fox, {{with him again}} become a freelance cinematographer. Before going freelance, two of the films he shot at Fox garnered Oscar nominations for him in two different categories: To the Shores of Tripoli for color cinematography, and The Pied Piper for best cinematography in {{the black and white}} medium. He won neither, losing to Joseph Ruttenberg in the black and white category for Mrs. Miniver, and to Leon Shamroy for the color cinematography in The Black Swan. Cronjager manned the camera for the classic My Friend Flicka in 1943, starring Roddy McDowall; but it was his work on Heaven Can Wait which earned him his fifth Oscar nomination, this one for color film photography. [...] D.W. Griffith called Cronjager's work in Heaven Can Wait [...] "the best color footage ever made". He would lose to Hal Mohr and W. Howard Greene for Phantom of the Opera. Cronjager received his fifth nomination in four years for his work on 1944's Home in Indiana, directed by Henry Hathaway, and starring Walter Brennan; he lost again, this time to Leon Shamroy for his photography of the film Wilson. His color photography on 1946's <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Me?,</b> starring Maureen O'Hara, Dick Haymes, and Harry James, was called [...] "superbly filmed in Technicolor", contributing to the film's appeal and success.|$|E

2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> <b>me</b> too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
