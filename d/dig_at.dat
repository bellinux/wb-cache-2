5|$|Re-Invention World Tour was {{the sixth}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It {{supported}} her ninth studio album American Life and visited North America and Europe. Madonna {{was inspired to}} create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> Madonna's critics. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist.|$|E
5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties would issue {{their own}} paper money as well. Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty {{to the north}} caught on to this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore a serial number, {{the number of the}} series, and a warning label that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.|$|E

While undertaking his own <b>digs</b> <b>at</b> night {{in the hope of}} discovering the treasure that was supposedly hidden there, Clarel believed that finding it depended on sacrificing a child.|$|R

5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed {{that would not have been}} possible in an all-live production.|$|E

She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> Madonna's critics. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. The tour was chronicled in the documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} world tour it documents and the exhibition, it was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe during May 24 to September 14, 2004, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. Critical response towards the documentary was mixed, with one group of reviewers complimenting the live performances from the tour and the scenes involving her children and family, while others criticized the self-indulgent nature of the documentary and the preaching nature of Madonna's commentary in the film.|$|E

5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a <b>dig</b> <b>at</b> the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
