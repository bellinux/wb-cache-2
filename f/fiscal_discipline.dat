25|$|The Mongol {{administration}} had issued paper currencies from 1227 on. In August 1260, Kublai {{created the first}} unified paper currency called Chao; bills were circulated throughout the Yuan domain with no expiration date. To guard against devaluation, the currency was convertible with silver and gold, and the government accepted tax payments in paper currency. In 1273, Kublai issued {{a new series of}} state sponsored bills to finance his conquest of the Song, although eventually a lack of <b>fiscal</b> <b>discipline</b> and inflation turned this move into an economic disaster. It was required to pay only in the form of paper money. To ensure its use, Kublai's government confiscated gold and silver from private citizens and foreign merchants, but traders received government-issued notes in exchange. Kublai Khan is considered to be the first fiat money maker. The paper bills made collecting taxes and administering the empire much easier and reduced the cost of transporting coins. In 1287, Kublai's minister Sangha created a new currency, Zhiyuan Chao, to deal with a budget shortfall. It was non-convertible and denominated in copper cash. Later Gaykhatu of the Ilkhanate attempted to adopt the system in Iran and the Middle East, which was a complete failure, and shortly afterwards he was assassinated.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back <b>fiscal</b> <b>discipline</b> in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E

He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. [...] He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} delegation of monetary policy through optimal central banker contracts {{and the effects}} of central bank behavior on <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>discipline</b> in a monetary union. First, we examine whether central banker contracts are an optimal form of monetary policy delegation when incomplete information about the central banker 2 ̆ 7 s preferences exists. We show that optimal Walsh (1995) contracts do not eliminate the inflationary bias in monetary policy. We design a more comprehensive mechanism that achieves this task by inducing central bankers to reveal their preferences. This mechanism can work with the adoption of inflation targets or the appointment of conservative central bankers. We then consider the effectiveness of central banker contracts when more that one potential principal exists. We develop a common agency model in central banking and show that the government 2 ̆ 7 s (society 2 ̆ 7 s) contract does not always dominate the competing contract offered by a (private) interest group. Which of the two incentive schemes dominates depends on the goals of the contracts and the principals 2 ̆ 7 relative concerns about contract costs. Finally, we develop a model of central bank decision making in a monetary union and examine how central bank behavior can enhance discipline for the national fiscal authorities. We show that introducing the possibility of tough punishment schemes enhances <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>discipline</b> by allowing the union central bank to reveal its type. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} Ghana’s performance in export of cocoa using the revealed comparative advantage and revealed symmetric comparative advantage measures of competitiveness for the periods 1964 - 69 (immediate years following the collapse of world price of cocoa), 1983 - 92 (Reform and Adjustment Period) and 2000 - 2010 (recent decade). In addition, the magnitude and effects of key economic determinants of cocoa exports, production and farm gate price for Ghana are estimated. RCA and RSCA figures computed {{in the current study}} show that Ghana has comparative advantage in export of both raw and processed cocoa, with its advantage being higher in exports of the raw product. Ghana’s performance in export of cocoa has improved significantly since 1983. This observation is attributed to initiation of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983 (which created the right conditions for agricultural investment and helped address inefficiencies in marketing and <b>fiscal</b> <b>disciplines),</b> the Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP) between 1987 and 1990 (which helped in strengthening the capacity of agricultural research, extension and policy planning), opening up of the domestic market to competition through partial liberalization of internal marketing from the early 1990 s, establishment of a price stabilization system and continuous government support to the sector through increased public spending on infrastructure and productivity-enhancing innovations. Improvement in the export performance, anticipated increases in global demand and world price of cocoa, wide yield gap of Ghana, positive attitude of farmers towards supply of cocoa due to increased government support, and intensification of competition on the domestic market indicate potential for further improvement in Ghana’s production and export of cocoa. However, upon estimates obtained in the current study, to realize any further improvement in the performance of the cocoa subsector, measures should be put in place to bridge the wide yield gap, ensure continuous government support to various stakeholders in the supply chain, and tighten the loose border between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to help minimize smuggling in times of increasing farm gate price of cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire...|$|R

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the pact was to ensure that <b>fiscal</b> <b>discipline</b> would be {{maintained}} and enforced in the EMU.

The <b>fiscal</b> <b>discipline</b> is ensured by the SGP by requiring each Member State, to implement a fiscal policy aiming {{for the country to}} stay within the limits on government deficit (3% of GDP) and debt (60% of GDP); and in case of having a debt level above 60% it should each year decline with a satisfactory pace towards a level below. As outlined by the [...] "preventive arm" [...] regulation, all EU member states are each year obliged to submit a SGP compliance report for the scrutiny and evaluation of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, that will present the country's expected fiscal development for the current and subsequent three years.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the use of {{automatic}} fiscal stabilisers, particularly in relation to New Zealand’s experience over the past business cycle. Allowing the automatic stabilisers to operate in response to cyclical fluctuations in output is likely to yield efficiency gains {{in a country with}} a sound fiscal position and a credible approach to medium-term fiscal stability. However, automatic stabilisation does increase the potential for <b>fiscal</b> ill <b>discipline.</b> A risk is that an imprudent Government could allow the automatic stabilisers to operate during a downturn and not bank the gains in the upturn. The discipline imposed by the FRA in New Zealand helps ensure that the Government acts prudently.

Reflecting this, the New Zealand Government has allowed the automatic stabilisers to operate to a greater extent during the most recent recession than during the 1991 recession. ...|$|R
