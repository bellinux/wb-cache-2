40|$|Abstract—The P 300 -based speller is a {{well-established}} brain–computer interface for communication. It displays {{a matrix of}} objects on the computer screen, flashes each object in sequence, and looks for a P 300 response induced by flashing the desired object. Most existing P 300 spellers uses a fixed <b>set</b> of <b>flash</b> objects. We demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by sequential selections from a hierarchy of <b>flash</b> <b>sets</b> containing variable number of objects. Theoretically, the optimal hierarchy of flash sets—with respect to a given statistical language model—can be found by solving a stochastic control problem of low computational complexity. Experimentally, statistical analysis demonstrates that the average time per output character at 85 % accuracy is reduced by over 50 % using our variable-flash-set approach as compared to traditional fixed-flash-set spellers.

5000|$|In the Justice League {{animated}} series, a team {{called the}} Justice Lords (who takes {{elements of the}} Crime Syndicate) appears as the League's counterparts from an alternate universe. They {{first appeared in the}} two-part Justice League episode [...] "A Better World", which was originally to feature the Crime Syndicate. Unlike the Crime Syndicate though, the Justice Lords are not simply evil opposites of their good counterparts. Rather, they rule their world with an iron fist in order to end war and crime.

It was the government's fears that the Justice League might one day become like the Justice Lords that sparked Project Cadmus as seen in the sequel series Justice League Unlimited. Robotic doubles of the Justice Lords are created as a diversion by the newly combined Lex Luthor/Brainiac in the Justice League Unlimited episode [...] "Divided We Fall". Of special note, the Justice Lords are said to have been also inspired at least in part by Wildstorm Comics' The Authority in the creative team's commentary on the DVD.|$|E

40|$|Early {{stiffening}} {{of cement}} {{has been noted}} as contributing to workability problems with concrete placed in the field. Early stiffening, normally attributed to cements whose gypsum is reduced to hemi⋅hydrate or anhydrate because of high finish mill temperatures, {{is referred to as}} false setting. Stiffening attributed to uncontrolled reaction of C 3 A is referred to as <b>flash</b> <b>set.</b> False setting may be overcame by extended mix period, while flash setting is usually more serious and workability is usually diminished with extended mixing. ASTM C 359 has been used to detect early stiffening with mixed results. The mini slump cone test was developed by Construction Technology Laboratories (CTL), Inc., as an alternative method of determining early stiffening. This research examined the mini slump cone test procedure to determine the repeatability of the results obtained from two different testing procedures, effect of w/c ratio, lifting rate of the cone, and accuracy of the test using a standard sample...|$|E
40|$|Concrete can {{be applied}} to a surface in for example tunnel {{construction}} and rock support by spraying it on the surface. When using sprayed concrete, a fast setting of the cement is desirable {{to reduce the amount of}} rebound and achieve a good contact with the sprayed surface. Therefore the effect of an alkali-free accelerator that is commonly used in sprayed concrete, in combination with nanosilica on the hydration of Portland cement during the first two hours was investigated. This was done with Vicat measurements, a method to measure the setting of cement, and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DR-FTIR). The cement paste contains water which has a very strong absorbance in the infrared spectra. This made it hard to see anything in the DR-FTIR spectra. Therefore a method to dry the samples had to be developed. It was concluded that freezing the samples with liquid nitrogen and then freeze dry them made it possible to achieve good enough spectra to follow the early hydration process. Nanosilica had almost no accelerating effect on the cement used in this work during early hydration if it was the only additive. This is due to the formation of an ettringite layer on the cement grains that prevents the interaction between nanosilica and cement. However, the accelerator was found to greatly decrease the setting time of the cement by removing the ettringite layer. When this accelerator was combined with nanosilica an even greater decrease of the setting time was achieved. The fast setting is not due to an undesired <b>flash</b> <b>set</b> of the aluminate phase in the cement, but an increased formation of C-S-H gel...|$|E
40|$|Calcium sulfate is {{typically}} added to {{ordinary portland cement}} (OPC) clinker during grinding to prevent <b>flash</b> <b>set</b> and to improve early-age strength development without causing volume instabilities. Recent changes to ASTM C 150, Standard Specification for Portland Cement, have enabled greater flexibility in determining optimum sulfate levels in portland cement by not requiring ASTM C 563, Approximation of Optimum SO 3 in Hydraulic Cement Using Compressive Strength, {{to be used in}} setting sulfate target levels. ASTM C 563 requires strength testing using only the hydraulic cement, which is not always indicative of the optimum sulfate for field use, since supplementary materials (e. g., fly ash) may be used by the concrete producer. Adding additional sulfate to account for the sulfate demand of fly ashes can enable an improvement in the early age strength for cement-fly ash systems and decrease in problems that may be attributed to OPC-admixture-fly ash incompatibility such as abnormal setting and slow strength gain. ^ This thesis provides experimental data on the strength development and heat release during early hydration for cement-fly ash systems with different sulfate levels. The thesis focused on high calcium fly ashes, but low calcium fly ash was also tested. It is demonstrated that some fly ashes have their own sulfate demand and when these ashes are used in cement-fly ash blends there is effectively an increase in the optimal sulfate level {{that could be used for}} the OPC. It is also shown that optimum sulfate determined by heat of hydration measured with isothermal calorimetry is similar to the optimum sulfate determined by compressive strength at 1 day. Using isothermal calorimetry can result in substantial time and cost savings at plants for determining the optimal sulfate content. ^ Theories for the mechanisms that drive the differences in sulfate demand in OPC are reviewed. These theories are adapted for OPC-fly ash blends and are outlined, tested and discussed. The testing of the theories is done by characterization through isothermal calorimetry, semi-quantitative x-ray diffraction (XRD), and pore solution ion concentration. This provides data that can be used to evaluate the explanations of why some fly ashes influence optimum sulfate. ^ The fly ash C 3 A and SO 3 have strong correlations to the increase in optimum sulfate along with freelime and soluble alkalis. The effect of the fly ash C 3 A can be explained by the reactions that occur with sulfate to form ettringite or monosulfate, by the reaction with sulfate to form ettringite which contributes to strength at higher levels, or by retardation of the main alite hydration peak of the cement which requires additional sulfate to keep the sulfate depletion after the main alite hydration peak. The position of the sulfate depletion peak relative the main alite hydration peak has been correlated to optimum sulfate in the past and in this thesis. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{earthquakes}} in Japan. If a large earthquake were to occur, {{it is necessary}} to consider how pipelines such as: gas, sewage, telecommunications, and so on are restored quickly. At that time, damaged gas pipelines are very dangerous because fire in large areas could be caused by the leakage of gas from the damaged pipeline. Accordingly, it is necessary for gas companies to stop the supply of gas to houses over a large area. Once the gas supply is stopped, there is a considerable amount of time to repair the pipelines over the area. For this reason, a quick method for restoring damaged gas pipelines would be useful after an earthquake. Recently, we have been developing new <b>flash</b> <b>setting</b> material for the damaged gas pipeline by an injection into the house connection of gas when the gas supply is stopped quickly in an emergency.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{establish}} the optimal flash settings for retinal vessel oxygen saturation parameters using dual-wavelength imaging in a multiethnic group. METHODS. Twelve healthy young subjects (mean age 32 years [SD 7]; three Mediterranean, two South Asian, and seven Caucasian individuals) underwent retinal vessel oxygen saturation measurements using dual-wavelength oximetry, noncontact tonometry, and manual sphygmomanometry. In order {{to evaluate the}} impact of flash intensity, we obtained three images (fundus camera angle 30 °, ONH centered) per <b>flash</b> <b>setting.</b> <b>Flash</b> settings of the fundus camera were increased in steps of 2 (initial setting of 6 and the final of 22), which reflect logarithmic increasing intensities from 13. 5 to 214 Watt seconds (Ws). RESULTS. Flash settings below 27 Ws were too low to obtain saturation measurements, whereas flash settings of more than 214 Ws resulted in overexposed images. Retinal arteriolar and venular oxygen saturation was comparable at flash settings of 27 to 76 Ws (arterioles' range: 85 %- 92 %; venules' range: 45 %- 53 %). Higher flash settings lead to increased saturation measurements in both retinal arterioles (up to 110 %) and venules (up to 92 %), with a more pronounced increase in venules. CONCLUSIONS. Flash intensity has {{a significant impact on}} retinal vessel oxygen saturation measurements using dual-wavelength retinal oximetry. High flash intensities lead to supranormal oxygen saturation measurements with a magnified effect in retinal venules compared with arteries. In addition to even retinal illumination, the correct <b>flash</b> <b>setting</b> is of paramount importance for clinical acquisition of images in retinal oximetry. We recommend flash settings between 27 to 76 Ws. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc...|$|R

The hydration mechanism was studied in detail by using a full Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier Transformed Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Mossbauer spectroscopy at room temperature. From the Rietveld refinement of XRD data, alite, belite, celite, brown-millerite and low quartz phases were detected and quantified as major phases in dry cement powder. After hydration, calcium carbonate, portlandite and ettringite phases were found to form. A large reduction in the amounts of alite and belite phases were observed suggesting the formation of amorphous C-S-H phase and emphasizing the role of alite phase in <b>flash</b> <b>setting</b> of cement, as justified by the XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. Mossbauer spectra of all the unset samples showed quadrupole split doublets corresponding to the brownmillerite phase which remains unchanged even after about one week of hydration, suggesting that brownmillerite did not transform to other phases during initial stage of hydration process.
