25|$|A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas <b>{{discharge}}</b> <b>lamp</b> {{which uses}} mercury in an excited state to produce light. The arc discharge is generally {{confined to a}} small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor. In either case, the outer bulb provides thermal insulation, protection from ultraviolet radiation, and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube. In 1901, Peter Cooper Hewitt invented and patented the mercury-vapor lamp.|$|E
2500|$|A xenon {{arc lamp}} is a {{specialized}} type of gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp,</b> an electric light that produces light by passing electricity through ionized xenon gas at high pressure. It produces a bright white light that closely mimics natural sunlight. [...] Xenon arc lamps are used in movie projectors in theaters, in searchlights, and for specialized uses in industry and research to simulate sunlight.|$|E
2500|$|The APPI {{interface}} for LC-MS {{was developed}} simultaneously by Bruins and Syage in 2000. [...] APPI is another LC-MS ion source/ interface {{for the analysis}} of neutral compounds that cannot be ionized using ESI. This interface is similar to the APCI ion source, but instead of a corona discharge, the ionization occurs by using photons coming from a <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> In the direct-APPI mode, singly charged analyte molecular ions are formed by absorption of a photon and ejection of an electron. In the dopant-APPI mode, an easily ionizable compound (Dopant) is added to the mobile phase or the nebulizing gas to promote a reaction of charge-exchange between the dopant molecular ion and the analyte. The ionized sample is later transferred to the mass analyzer at high vacuum as it passes through small orifice skimmers.|$|E

40|$|Research {{into high}} {{pressure}} mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> at Philips In this study {{the work of}} C. Bol and the physicist dr. W. Elenbaas in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in the period 1930 - 1940 is described. The paper treats their contributions to high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> especially the water cooled super high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> with a pressure of a few hundreds of atmosphere. Because of their rather white colour and high efficiency, high pressure mercury lamps were, from 1906 on, a potential rival of the incandescent lamps, especially for street and square lighting. However, severe problems with the ignition of the gas discharge and the lead-in wires prevented the introduction of these lamps at that time. In the early thirties Bol contributed to a great extend to {{the solution of the}} problem of the lead-in wires, after which super high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> were technically feasible. Elenbaas theoretically derived mathematical relations between technically important variables, such as efficiency, candlepower and luminence, which were instrumental in the invention and development of super high pressure mercury lamps. Some remarks are made on the differences between scientifically and technically oriented theories. It is concluded that in an industrial context a special kind of theories is developed which could be denominated 'technological theories'. ...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} sources {{found many}} application areas in science and technology. They {{play an important role}} within several markets worldwide today. One of these markets is disinfection and photochemical purification of water which has been a growing market for many decades. At the moment low pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{the state of the art}} technology. Although they have been developed towards an impressive maturity level, they still show many drawbacks as e. g. strong temperature dependence. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to a mercury free alternative radiation source for this market, namely so called phosphor converted excimer <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> They are in the centre of present R&D activities, since they offer several advantages compared to the mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> such as very little temperature sensitivity, a high customisability of the emission spectrum, a large form factor, and instant full radiation power after they have been switched on. A brief description of the technology of phosphor converted excimer lamps will be sketched and furthermore their potential as a possible game changer for water disinfection and photochemical water purification market areas will be highlighted...|$|R

40|$|High {{intensity}} <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> with magnetic ballast are energy-efficient lighting devices {{commonly used}} in industrial and public installations. These lamps can be important pollution loads, and their harmonic modeling has been extensively studied considering linear magnetic ballast and square arc voltage waveform.

This paper proposes a PSpice model of high intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> considering both the non-linear behavior of the magnetic ballast and the non-square waveform of the arc voltage.
