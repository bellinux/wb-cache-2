40|$|Agent-based {{methods have}} {{provided}} economics with {{new ways of}} modeling economic processes. We have found these possibilities useful with respect to modeling endogenous growth, in particular the modeling of learning agents that must cope with real world growth constraints such as time, space, and complexity. Time and space are immediately given once a two-dimensional space with agents moving in time is introduced. Complexity is modeled by using single-cell neural nets {{as a metaphor for}} production units and XOR-problems as metaphors for <b>demand</b> <b>signals.</b> The production units learn by changing the weights in their neural nets, but their structure is too simple to learn to respond correctly to <b>demand</b> <b>signals.</b> However, as entrepreneurs, production units may connect more production units into more complex neural nets and thus improve the efficiency. We thus have an artificial economy where economic growth is driven by demand but limited by both demand and supply sides. On the supply side, neural nets must receive <b>demand</b> <b>signals</b> to learn and thus become more efficient. Besides time and space constraints in the search for efficient production, the demand side is constrained by the distribution of the generated wealth since agents have limited access to credit. An interesting feature of the model is how it produces cycles around the growth path. ...|$|R

5000|$|In a Just-in-time {{manufacturing}} or operations context, a <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> identifies a {{need for}} new materials and triggers a delivery from an internal store or an external supplier. The Kanban system uses cards ('Kanban cards') to mark the stock level at which a replenishment signal needs to be issued. Kanban cards are {{a key component of}} a kanban system as they signal the need to move materials within a production facility or to move materials from an outside supplier into the production facility. The kanban card is, in effect, a message which signals depletion of product, parts, or inventory. When received, the kanban triggers replenishment of that product, part, or inventory. Consumption, therefore, drives demand for more production, and the kanban card signals demand for more product — so kanban cards help create a demand-driven system.|$|E

5000|$|One key {{indicator}} {{of the success of}} production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [...] "pull" [...] comes from demand. Re-supply or production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer. In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, stock building may be deemed more appropriate, and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.|$|E
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of a profit-maximizing vendor selling a {{perishable}} product. At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the <b>demand</b> <b>signal.</b> We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed [...] one for each <b>demand</b> <b>signal.</b> The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable <b>demand</b> <b>signal.</b> newsvendor model, in-stock probability, fill rate, <b>demand</b> <b>signal,</b> service constraint, Kuhn-Tucker conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} how firms design supply contract and share information for supply chains under horizontal competition and asymmetric information. The problem is studied using a model of two supply chains, each consists of one manufacturer and one retailer. Each retailer will observe a private <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> about the market and decide whether to share it with the manufacturer of his own chain. A multi-stage game is formulated to analyze how different firms make information sharing, contracting and retail quantity (or price) decisions. For a perfect <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> model with Cournot competition, we show that the incentives of information sharing are positive under quantity-based contract menus but become negative under linear price contracts. We also show that a lower investment cost for information sharing (or a higher information sharing capability) is a competitive advantage, which is more significant when the competing supply chain that has a higher investment cost is induced not to invest in information sharing and is made less aggressive due to the use of contract menus. For an imperfect <b>demand</b> <b>signal</b> model with revenue sharing contracts, we show that the incentives for information sharing are always negative under Cournot competition but can be positive or negative under Bertrand competition. For the latter case, it is more likely for a supply chain to have positive incentives for information sharing when the signal precision (or forecasting capability) of either supply chain is higher, the products are more similar, the manufacturer can get more revenue allocation or the competing manufacturer gets less revenue allocation...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{property}} {{has taken}} centre-stage in recent debates about Ireland's banking {{system and the}} health of our economy. However, these debates have been hampered by a lack of empirical research on non-residential real estate. This article sheds light on one key segment of the commercial property sector - the Dublin office market. Using 32 years of annual data, a simple regression model is elaborated which explains office completions. This indicates that office starts react to two key <b>demand</b> <b>signals</b> - rental growth and lettings activity, with completions following after an 18 month construction lag. Reliance on these simple <b>demand</b> <b>signals,</b> combined with a lengthy construction lag, leads to periodic supply overshoots. In turn, this contributes to the boom-bust pattern that has characterised office building in Dublin over many years. We are now entering the 'bust' phase of this cycle. Office completions remained strong in 2008 but the Dublin market is now overbuilt. Our model predicts that output will fall by 48 per cent next year and by a further 14 per cent in 2010. All else equal this will deduct 0. 5 - 0. 6 per cent directly from GNP and will lead to the loss of approximately 7, 500 construction jobs. qec/Ireland/growth...|$|R
