60|$|Between ten {{and eleven}} o'clock, finding that neither Fairway nor anybody else came to him, he retired to rest, {{and despite his}} anxieties soon fell asleep. His sleep, however, was not very sound, by reason of the {{expectancy}} he had given way to, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>easily</b> <b>awakened</b> by a knocking which began at the door about an hour after. Clym arose and looked out of the window. Rain was still falling heavily, the whole expanse of heath before him emitting a subdued hiss under the downpour. It was {{too dark to see}} anything at all.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} a patient who became comatose after taking an overdose of duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. CASE SUMMARY: A 49 -year-old male ingested an overdose of duloxetine approximately 2 hours before presentation to the emergency department. On arrival <b>he</b> <b>was</b> drowsy, but <b>easily</b> <b>awakened</b> and oriented, with Glasgow Coma Score 14 (eyes 3, motor 6, verbal 5). Immediately after admission, charcoal and magnesium sulfate were given to prevent further systemic absorption of medication through the gastrointestinal tract. No gastric lavage was performed. Six hours after drug intake the patient became unconscious (Glasgow Coma Score 7, eyes 2, motor 4, verbal 1). Full toxicologic screening showed a toxic duloxetine plasma concentration of 0. 86 mg/L. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and, on arrival, urinary retention was noted. During ICU admission the patient remained hemodynamically stable; approximately 12 hours after ingestion of duloxetine, he regained consciousness. Over the next 3 days the urinary output decreased to 60 mL/day. After 4 days patient was discharged without any remaining symptoms. Based on repeated plasma duloxetine serum concentration determinations, a plasma half-life of duloxetine was calculated to be 18 hours (reference range 9 - 19). DISCUSSION: The Naranjo probability scale suggested that duloxetine was the probable cause for the symptoms described. CONCLUSION: Overdose with duloxetine can induce coma several hours after intake, with a fast reversal in our case...|$|R

5000|$|The urban {{legend of}} cow tipping relies upon the {{presumption}} that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. Some versions suggest that because cows sleep standing up, {{it is possible to}} approach them and push them over without the animals reacting. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> <b>awakened.</b> They lie down to sleep deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.|$|R

500|$|Cow tipping is {{the purported}} {{activity}} of {{sneaking up on}} any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend, and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment {{due to lack of}} other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> <b>awakened.</b> They lie down to sleep deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{research}} {{that suggests that}} claustrophobia isn't entirely a classically conditioned or learned phobia. It is not necessarily an inborn fear, {{but it is very}} likely what is called a prepared phobia. As Erin Gersley says in [...] "Phobias: Causes and Treatments," [...] humans are genetically predisposed to become afraid of things that are dangerous to them. Claustrophobia may fall under this category because of its [...] "wide distribution… early onset and seeming easy acquisition, and its non-cognitive features." [...] The acquisition of claustrophobia may be part of a vestigial evolutionary survival mechanism, a dormant fear of entrapment and/or suffocation that was once important for the survival of humanity and could <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>awakened</b> at any time. Hostile environments in the past would have made this kind of pre-programmed fear necessary, and so the human mind developed the capacity for [...] "efficient fear conditioning to certain classes of dangerous stimuli".|$|R
