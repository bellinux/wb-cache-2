As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that many linear (0, 2) models flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{infrared}} to conformally invariant solutions of string theory. <b>The</b> strategy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> argument {{is to show that}} the effective space-time superpotential must vanish because there is no place where it can have a pole.

40|$|Following Shelly Kagan’s useful terminology, {{foundational}} consequentialists {{are those}} who hold that the ranking of outcomes is at the foundation of all moral assessment. That is, they hold that moral assessments of right and wrong, virtuous and vicious, morally good and morally bad, etc. are all ultimately a function of how outcomes rank. But foundational consequentialists disagree on {{what is to be}} directly evaluated <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> ranking of outcomes, {{which is to say that}} they disagree on what the primary evaluative focal point is. Act-consequentialists take acts to be the primary evaluative focal point. They evaluate acts in terms of how their outcomes rank (the higher ranked the outcome, the morally better the act), but evaluate <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> morally best acts. Thus, the morally best rules are those that would, if internalized, most reliably lead us to perform the morally best acts. Rule-consequentialists, by contrast, take rules to be the primary evaluative focal point. They evaluate rules according to how their outcomes rank and then assess <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> morally best rules. Thus, the morally best acts are those that conform to the morally best rules. 	In this paper, I argue that foundational consequentialists should not take the primary evaluative focal point (or points) to be acts, rules, virtues, or even everything. In so doing, I argue against act-consequentialism, rule-consequentialism, and global consequentialism. But my project is not entirely negative, for I argue that the primary evaluative focal point should be a complex of acts and attitudes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, then, I claim that foundational consequentialists should accept a new kind of consequentialism, which I call attitude-consequentialism...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new method to measure difficulties in market access {{over a large}} sample of countries (both developing and developed), industries and years.

Those difficulties in Northern market access have however experienced a noticeable fall during the last thirty years.

We can easily {{say that it is}} the main focus, gradually replacing <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>In</b> parallel with <b>the</b> development of branding there are realized the first attempts with respect to its principles and methods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation, maintenance and protection of the trade mark to be used also in other areas of public life and mostly in politics. Contemporary politics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conditions of a democratic transition and market organization of society is oriented towards rational political and the connected with those economic programs. The creation and <b>the</b> lasting presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minds of people require stability, transparency and predictability. Contemporary political marketing originates from the same principle of new consumer culture, trying through branding to form in society or certain segments of it a stable and heightened interest in political parties as in a “group of homonymous goods” and this is understandable since it is easier to raise and impose a whole party (or rather its brand) than each separate candidate for a position of authority. Branding is not only a modern word <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vocabulary of marketeers, but an activity, which prospering companies do every day in order to keep their competitiveness. The same also goes for political subjects which in time turn into sustainable political brands through the creation of trust between their own brand and its supporters. The object {{of this study is to}} reveal how the principles and laws of branding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation, affirmation and protection of the trade mark can also be applied in politics or at least to find specific similarities between the trade mark and the political brand. The main objective is to initiate an academic discussion on the applicability of the laws and principles of branding in politics as a specific area of public life. ...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{econometrics}} {{and also}} multilevel modelling techniques are increasingly {{part of the}} regional scientists‟ toolbox. Both approaches are used to model spatial autocorrelation {{in a wide variety}} of applications. However, it is not always clear on which basis researchers make a choice between spatial econometrics and spatial multilevel modelling. Therefore it is useful to compare both techniques. Spatial econometrics incorporates neighbouring areas into the model design; and thus interprets spatial proximity as defined in Tobler‟s first law of geography. On the other hand, multilevel modelling using geographical units takes a more hierarchical approach. <b>In</b> this case <b>the</b> first law of geography can be rephrased as „everything is related to <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> but things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same region are more related than things <b>in</b> different regions‟. <b>The</b> hierarchy (multilevel) and the proximity (spatial econometrics) approach are illustrated using Belgian mobility data and productivity data of European regions. One of the advantages of a multilevel model is that it can incorporate more than two levels (spatial scales). Another advantage is that a multilevel structure can easily reflect an administrative structure with different government levels. Spatial econometrics on the other hand works with a unique set of neighbours which has the advantage that there still is a relation between neighbouring municipalities separated by a regional boundary. The concept of distance can also more easily be incorporated in a spatial econometrics setting. Both spatial econometrics and spatial multilevel modelling proved to be valuable techniques in spatial research but more attention should go to the rationale why one of the two approaches is chosen. We conclude with some comments on models which make a combination of both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Claims for {{additional}} preliminaries cost due to project prolongation {{is actually a}} part of loss and/or expense claim. The principle governing this claim was established in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) which provides that the party who suffers direct and reasonably foreseeable costs entitled to damages. This principle has been adopted <b>in</b> most of <b>the</b> standard forms of contract in Malaysia. As required by the contractual provisions such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PWD 203 A (Rev. 2010 / 1), PAM Contract 2006, CIDB Form 2000 and IEM Form 1989, the contractor?s entitlement to loss and/or expense is limited to selected delaying events. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> submission of claim must be made in specific time period as provided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contract. There are cases when <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> order, <b>the</b> contractor was denied a claim due to his own failure {{to abide by the}} procedural requirement for submission of claim. The heads of claim under the loss and/or expense generally can be grouped under seven categories i. e. additional expenditure, interest and financing charges, loss of productivity, inflationary cost increase of materials and labour, site overheads or preliminaries, offsite or head office overheads and loss of profit. The objective of this research is to determine the preliminaries items that are considered and recommended for payment by contract administrators in claims {{for additional}} prolongation costs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian construction industry. As a general guide, a possible list of claimable preliminaries items established from this study may be useful to contractors in their submission of loss and/or expense claims due to project prolongation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. It is also beneficial to contract administrators to learn how others evaluate the claims and thus, able to improve themselves on the way loss and/or expense being evaluated as compared to <b>the</b> settled law <b>in</b> this regard...|$|R
