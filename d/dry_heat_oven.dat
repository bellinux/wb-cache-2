A descriptive study was made of how Public Dental Medicine Colleges in Brazil process critical materials and determine the patterns of physical, chemical and biological control {{in their use of}} hot air ovens and autoclaves to sterilize these materials. The data were obtained with a questionnaire, sent by mail and analyzed with the software EPI-INFO 6. 04. Among the 40 Brazilian public Dental Medicine Colleges, only 16 returned the questionnaire. In eight of these, the individuals responsible for the materials and sterilization center had a college degree in a human health field. In 14 institutions, the students were responsible for the cleaning of the instruments, but in six of these they did so outside of the materials and sterilization center. Both the autoclave and the <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were the method of choice in 13 of the 16 schools. The sterilization routine was routinely monitored by 11 of the institutions. Chemical control through the tape test in the autoclave was used by 13 of the schools, three institutions reported preventive maintenance, and biological indicators were used by seven of the 16 schools. Autoclaves are widely used because of the degree of biological security that this method offers, however physical, chemical and biological controls have not been routinely implemented by most of the institutions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. In dental offices, {{sterilization}} {{of instruments}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects of infection control. Autoclave effectiveness in killing microorganisms can be verified by spore tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sterilization procedures of private dental offices in Hong Kong, and to test the effectiveness of their autoclaves using biological indicators. Methods. Packages of an 18 -item questionnaire and two biological indicators were sent to 402 private dental practices in Hong Kong. They were instructed to complete the questionnaire, and perform a spore test in their autoclave using the biological indicators and return them for incubation. Results. One hundred and eighty-two practices responded, with a response rate of 45 %. Excluding three imcomplete questionnaires and four practices using <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> <b>oven,</b> a total of 175 autoclaves were tested. Thirteen (7 %) of the autoclaves failed the initial spore test. Twelve of these practices performed a re-test, whereupon two (1 %) of the autoclaves failed again. Among these 175 autoclaves, 77 (44 %) were the Fuji Elite model. The commonest (n= 72; 41 %) packing material and method entailed sterilization pouches. Twenty-three (13 %) of the respondents used improper sterilization time/temperature conditions for processing the instruments. For autoclaves older than 1 year, only 38 % (n= 58) had been serviced in the last year. One hundred and nine (62 %) of the respondents used chemical indicators and only seven (4 %) used biological indicators to monitor sterilization. Conclusion. Autoclaves in private dental practice in Hong Kong should be regularly checked, and their effectiveness routinely monitored. The use of biological indicators to monitor the sterilization was uncommon and knowledge about proper autoclaves usage needs improving. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

This experimental laboratory study was conducted at the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Department in the Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung and at the Microbiology Laboratory Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor. The Protocol was performed in three methods of sterilization: <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> with <b>oven</b> and ozone, <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> with <b>oven</b> and infrared (125) C for 15 minutes), both were monitored by Bacillus atrophaeus as the biologic indicators, and autoclavization (121 " C for 15 minutes) with Geobaciflus stearothermophilus as the biological monitoring, with 17 times repetition. After sterilization, all of the indicators were cultured on Nutrient Agar Plate (NAPS), and the subsequent growth was assessed. The colony forming units (CFUs) were counted by Stuart Electric Bacteria Colony Counter. Adequate positive and negative controls were used in every cycle. The results showed that after autoclavization, all spores were killed. In comparison with <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> in the <b>oven,</b> there were still CFUs on the NAPs, but no colonies grow after 3 repetitions by <b>oven</b> and infrared. <b>Heating</b> in <b>oven</b> and ozone could only reduce the spore numbers, even after repeating 5 times.

Abstract : The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dry heat dental offices in Florianópolis, S. C., Brazil. The work intended to discover the capacity dry heat ovens have to eradicate the spores of B. subtilis on biological indicators strips and also to compare temperatures during the sterilization cycles to the ones proposed in the literature. Moreover, it endeavored to assure that the built in thermometer and thermostat in the <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were reliable, and to analyze the influence how the materials were displayed in the sterilization chambers. As a complementing part, a survey was made in order to investigate who operates the dry heat ovens in different dental clinics and their specialist field of work. The results indicated that, out of the samples tested, a rate fall of 22. 5 % was found in dry heat ovens effectiveness to destroy the spores of R subtilis. Moreover, from the final results, it is possible to infer that only 48. 1 % of the dry heat ovens investigated actually used the parameters (time and temperatare) as proposed in the literature. From the observed samples, it was also shown that the built in thermometers and thermostat were not reliable. Furthermore, results suggested that there was temperature variation inside the dry heat ovens, therefore, it was found that the materials placed in the upper shelf received less heat. Finally, findings confirmed that dental assistants were responsible for managing the dry heat ovens in 67. 5 % of the dental offices surveyed. Last but no least, although there was a vast area of specialists participating in the survey, such as periodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, implantodontics, pedodontics, and radiology, general clinics showed to have participated with the highest percentage (57. 5 %) ...|$|E

The improvement of the mechanical properties of Thai rice starch polymer films were achieved by addition of small amount of gelatin, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and carbon nanopowders. The carbon nanopowders were produced from coconut shell in our laboratory room by milling method. The incorporation of carbon nanopowders with a high aspect ratio and/or an extremely large surface area into Thai rice starch polymer films improves their mechanical performances significantly. Additionally, the black color from carbon nanopowder is easily visualized in tissue during surgery.

Controlled <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> has now become a common industrial process for improving the functional properties of food proteins. Besides this improvement, chemical modifications in protein structures involving degradation of amino acids, new intra or inter-molecular disulfide bonds, isopeptide bonds, and some other links may occur. These chemical modifications are favored by severe heating under neutral or alkaline conditions, and except disulfide interchanges, are usually not predominant during heat treatments in solution and their occurrence is not well understood. Understanding chemical modifications in protein structure that occur during <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> of protein powders is a prerequisite for reproducible properties of final products at industrial scale. In the present work, we focused on how <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> under acidic pH conditions affects the chemical modifications and denaturation/aggregation reactions of whey proteins. Model whey protein (β-lactoglobulin) powders obtained from freeze drying of protein concentrates adjusted to pHs 2. 5 & 6. 5 were adjusted to a fixed water activity (Aw 0. 23). The samples were <b>dry</b> <b>heated</b> at 100 °C for up to 24 hours and structural modifications induced during <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> were followed. We showed that whatever the pH value, proteins were characterized by irreversible mass losses of 18 Da. Such mass losses were increased at lower pH value. <b>Dry</b> <b>heating</b> mainly generated small aggregates (dimers and oligomers). Strikingly, at pH 2. 5 intermolecular disulfide bonds were the only crosslinks between proteins in the aggregated forms while covalent crosslinks other than disulfide bonds also participated at pH 6. 5. β-Lactoglobulin hydrolysis was also detected at pH 2. 5 and some of the peptides were incorporated in the oligomers. These results underline that chemical modifications in protein structures induced by <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> are highly pH dependent. Hence, strict control of pH conditions for <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> is indispensable to give reproducible functionality in products where such modified proteins are incorporated as ingredient...|$|R
50|$|Moist {{heat therapy}} has been {{believed}} {{to be more effective}} at warming tissues than <b>dry</b> <b>heat,</b> because water transfers heat more quickly than air. Clinical studies do not support the popular belief that moist heat is more effective than <b>dry</b> <b>heat.</b> Moist heat results in the perception that the tissue is heated more deeply. In fact, recent studies indicate that vasodilation, the expansion of the blood capillaries (vessels) to allow more blood flow, is improved with <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> therapy. Expansion of the blood capillaries is the primary objective of heat therapy. Heat therapy increases the effect on muscles, joints, and soft tissue. Heat is typically applied by placing a warming device on the relevant body part.|$|R
