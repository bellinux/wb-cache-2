A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz <b>diorite</b> some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{research}} on the petrological geochronology and zircon SHRIMP U-Pb of Thongehang <b>diorites,</b> Mian-Lue-Ning area, Southern Shanxi Province, China. The {{results show that the}} <b>diorites,</b> which belong to low K cale-alkali series rocks, are characterized by comparative losing of medium-high field strong elements in microelements and comparative enrichment of large ion lithophile elements. The Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the <b>diorites,</b> which are similar and successive with that of Bikou group marine volcanic rocks, belong to the LREE-rich type with obvious negative anomaly of Eu, reflecting its island-arc volcanic features. It is suggested that there is a relationship between the <b>diorites</b> and the mineralization of Cu, the <b>diorites</b> may be one of source of metallogenic mass, and the <b>diorites</b> may come from the earth's crust or consumingly contaminated by the earth's crust with no remarkable crystallization differentiation. The geological setting of the forming of the <b>diorites</b> was belonging to collision doming-island arc volcanic, and the mineralization was late to the intrusion of the <b>diorites.</b> The <b>diorites</b> has a SHRIMP zircon U-Pb age of 842 +/- 6. 5 Ma and suggests it belongs to the invasive magma at the late stage of the stratum-Bikou group spilite, and formed by partly melting from Bikou group spilite. The comparative enrichment of LREE of the <b>diorites</b> may relate to inheriting the REE feature of the source of rocks...|$|R

40|$|Hercynian gabbroic, dioritic and tonalitic rocks crop {{out in the}} {{neighbourhood}} of Rovale (Sila Grande, Calabria). They make up a crude rectangular outcrop {{with the}} western part consisting of gabbroic rocks and the eastern of dioritic and tonalitic rocks. They {{come into contact with}} medium to high grade metapelites on the western side and with heterogeneous granodiorites on the other sides. In the gabbroic body both opx +/- ol bearing cumulates and amphibole differentiates occur and are characterized by the widespread presence of brown pargasite. Sporadic magmatic to subsolidus corona textures between olivine and plagioclase or orthopyroxene and plagioclase can be observed and their preservation clearly suggests a post-tectonic emplacement for the gabbroic magma. <b>Diorites</b> and tonalites display hypidiomorphic textures free of olivine and orthopyroxene and bearing green Mg-hornblende. The granitoids, on the basis of chemical data, display orogenic features of the continent-continent collision type. The gabbroic rocks have high Al tholeiitic composition and fractionation of orthopyroxene and plagioclase played an important part in their evolution. The Rb/Sr isochron method did not give a precise emplacement age for the granitoids as a whole. Initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios (at 290 Ma) are higher in the gabbroic body (0. 7091 - 0. 7095) than in <b>diorites</b> and tonalites (0. 7083 - 0. 7092). Thus gabbroic rocks appear more displaced than <b>diorites</b> and tonalites towards crustal isotopic composition. The epsilonNd data seem to confirm this feature, thus suggesting that the gabbroic rocks and <b>diorites</b> derived from distinct mantle magma batches. Interestingly, small isotropic gabbroic masses occur within the <b>diorites</b> and show general features that allow them to be considered as possibly parental with respect to the host <b>diorites.</b> The evolution to the dioritic composition might have occurred through fractionation and minor mixing with a more acidic component such as the northern granodiorites. Geochemical, Sr and Nd isotopic data indicate a scenario of a composite plutonic body formed by distinct magma batches of mixed crust and mantle origin...|$|R
40|$|The Bandombaai Complex (southern Kaoko Belt, Namibia) {{consists}} of three main intrusive rock types including metaluminous hornblende- and sphene-bearing quartz <b>diorites,</b> allanite-bearing granodiorites and granites, and peraluminous garnet- and muscovite-bearing leucogranites. Intrusion of the quartz <b>diorites</b> is constrained by a U-Pb zircon age of 540 Ma. Quartz <b>diorites,</b> granodiorites and granites display heterogeneous initial Nd- and O isotope compositions (eNd (540 Ma) =+ 6. 3 to + 19. 8; d 18 O= 9. 0 - 11. 6 permil) but rather low and uniform initial Sr isotope compositions (87 Sr/ 86 Srinitial = 0. 70794 - 0. 70982). Two leucogranites and one aplite have higher initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 70828 - 0. 71559), but similar initial eNd (+ 11. 9 to + 15. 8) and oxygen isotope values (10. 5 - 12. 9 permil). The geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the Bandombaai Complex are distinct from other granitoids of the Kaoko Belt and the Central Zone of the Damara orogen. Our study suggests that the quartz <b>diorites</b> of the Bandombaai Complex are generated by melting of heterogeneous mafic lower crust. Based on a comparison with results from amphibolite-dehydration melting experiments, a lower crustal garnet- and amphibole-bearing metabasalt, probably enriched in K 2 O, is a likely source rock for the quartz <b>diorites.</b> The granodiorites/granites show low Rb/Sr (1) and are most likely generated by biotitedehydration melting of heterogeneous felsic lower crust. All segments of the lower crust underwent partial melting during the Pan-African orogeny at a time (540 Ma) when the middle crust of the central Damara orogen also underwent high T, medium P regional metamorphism and melting. Geochemical and isotope data from the Bandombaai Complex suggest that the Pan-African orogeny {{in this part of}} the orogen was not a major crust-forming episode. Instead, even the most primitive rock types of the region, the quartz <b>diorites,</b> represent recycled lower crustal material...|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land {{now known as the}} Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon.

It was shown that: (1) the reduced thickness of the tetrahedral sheet in Ba-rich biotites supports the coupled substitution (IV) Si + (XII) K half arrow left over half arrow right (IV) Al + (XII) Ba; (2) the interlayer site geometry is affected by the whole layer chemistry and does not reflect only local chemical variations; (3) in two samples of the 2 M 1 polytype, the M(1) octahedral site is larger and more distorted than the M(2) sites because of the preferential ordering of Fe 2 + in the M(1) site, whereas one sample shows complete cation disorder in the octahedral sites.
