5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and <b>illegal</b> <b>use,</b> it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the <b>illegal</b> <b>use</b> of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The overall aims of {{this study}} are to {{describe}} the life stressors of, exposure to <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> of, and <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> by older methadone clients. Design and Methods. The current study focuses on a subsample of the larger administrative data of a methadone clinic that is limited to African American and White clients over the age of 50 (N 143). A logistic regression model tested the relationship between life stressors, exposure to <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use,</b> and a respondent’s ability to remain abstinent from <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> in the previous month. Results. Older methadone clients exposed to <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> in their social networks and neighbor-hoods {{were significantly more likely to}} <b>use</b> <b>illegal</b> drugs in the last month. Implications. Although demographic trends in the methadone population indicate that this cohort is aging and that their numbers are growing, little research exists on their well-being and service needs...|$|R

At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|During the race, nine riders were {{excluded}} because of, among other actions, <b>illegal</b> <b>use</b> of cars or trains. The Tour organizers were {{happy with the}} result, but the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF) started an investigation after complaints from other cyclists. Their investigative committee heard testimony from dozens of competitors and witnesses, and, in December 1904, disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers (Maurice Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Aucouturier). Ten of those disqualified were banned for one year, Maurice Garin {{for two years and}} the remaining two for life. In total, 29 riders were punished.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{moves in}} with fellow senior citizen Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the <b>illegal</b> <b>use</b> of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes {{to stay with}} the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against {{euthanasia}} and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.|$|E

After factors such as social class background and educational qualifications had been taken into account a weak but significant association was found between duration of unemployment and <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use.</b> No such association was found for alcohol or tobacco. Similar results were obtained from an analysis of national statistics related to unemployment and <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use.</b> Both sets of data thus indicate that <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> is moderately associated with unemployment...|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>use</b> by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} <b>illegal</b> <b>use</b> of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E

40|$|Government {{policy to}} address <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> and {{possession}} {{is an ongoing}} topic of debate both in Australia and internationally. One {{part of the debate}} surrounding <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> and possession involves {{the question of whether or}} not recreational drug use should be decriminalised, as has occurred in overseas jurisdictions such as Portugal. Another, and more immediate, part of the debate concerns the harms that have resulted from <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> at music festivals. The NSW Government is reviewing the regulation of these events but has rejected options put forward by some stakeholders, including allowing pill testing and amnesty bins. The suggestion by drug law reform proponents that ice users be allowed to attend a medically supervised smoke inhalation room is also on the public agenda. An upcoming forum for discussing <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> and possession is the Parliamentary Cross-Party Harm Minimisation Roundtable, to be held on 11 August at the NSW Parliament. This paper seeks to inform the current debate by discussing: 	rates of <b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> and the harms of illegal drug use;   	current Government policy and laws in relation to illegal drug use; 	the use and effectiveness of harm reduction measures, such as the Medically Supervised Injecting Centre; 	<b>illegal</b> drug <b>use</b> at music festivals; and 	arguments for and against prohibition and decriminalisation, with examples and evidence from Australian and overseas jurisdiction...|$|R

The results also showed that illegal PES users and male, older, and athlete students held stronger attitudes favoring <b>illegal</b> PES <b>use.</b> Finally, results showed that those student athletes who reported having used legal PES in the past three months were 10 times more likely to also have <b>used</b> <b>illegal</b> PES than those student athletes who did not report having used legal PES...|$|R
