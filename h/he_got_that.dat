500|$|Although Jack had tattoos {{on his arm}} {{the entire}} series, their origin had never been explained. Matthew Fox {{received}} the tattoos before Lost was even created. The producers considered putting make-up over them, but instead, decided just to keep them and fit it in with the plot. According to Assistant Professor Xinping Zhu of Northeastern University, the tattoo {{is made up of}} four Chinese characters from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1925. Fox's tattoo translates to [...] "Eagles high up, cleaving the space". (In this episode however, one of [...] "the Others" [...] tells Jack that his tattoo translates as: [...] "He walks among us, but he is not one of us." [...] Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean.") [...] The number 5 can also be seen on Fox's forearm; <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> tattoo while working on Party of Five, along with another cast member. In an interview, Fox said that for him, getting a tattoo was a [...] "pretty intense experience", and something he would not do in the [...] "spur of the moment". He thought Jack having tattoos was a [...] "really cool idea". Since Fox used tattoos to represent memories or meaningful events in his life, the writers took a similar approach when dealing with Jack's tattoos.|$|E
500|$|Initial reviews were mixed, {{with some}} critics applauding the story's conclusion, and others deriding it. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, opined that the episode worked best [...] "if some of the {{previous}} Samantha-related clues were forgotten", such as when the Alien Bounty Hunter told Mulder {{that she was still}} alive in [...] "End Game". Despite this, he wrote that [...] "it was only right that Samantha be dead since Mulder's life had always been defined by what he has lost, not what he has found". He surmised that the episode was not [...] "perfect", but that its [...] "plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along the way". He was also complimentary towards [...] "the ethereal quality of the final few moments", writing that they [...] "lifted this episode up and made it one of the season's most memorable". Kenneth Silber from Space.com was pleased with the episode, and wrote, [...] "'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha." [...] Jeremy Conrad from IGN referred to the episode as [...] "excellent" [...] and noted that a large portion of The X-Files mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, [...] " [...] a final, and concrete, answer to the single thing that was driving Mulder for the entire run of the series. In some ways, when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> answer a major part of The X-Files story ended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rogers first outing {{for his new}} label was Love Lifted Me. The album charted and two singles, [...] "Love Lifted Me" [...] and [...] "While the Feeling's Good," [...] were minor hits. The song [...] "Runaway Girl" [...] was {{featured}} in the motion picture Trackdown. Later in 1976, Rogers issued his second album, the self-titled Kenny Rogers, whose first single, [...] "Laura (What's <b>He</b> <b>Got</b> <b>That</b> I Ain't Got)," [...] was another solo hit.|$|E
2500|$|After {{switching}} to ABC Records {{in the late}} 1960s, he found himself {{at the top of}} the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, [...] "I'll Take Care of Your Cares". Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, [...] "Cares" [...] had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts. A string of hits followed including [...] "Making Memories", [...] "You Wanted Someone to Play With", [...] "Laura (What's <b>He</b> <b>Got</b> <b>That</b> I Ain't Got)", [...] "To Each His Own", [...] "I Found You", and [...] "Lord, You Gave Me A Mountain" [...] (which was written by Marty Robbins). The last song was a number one hit on the adult contemporary chart (#24 national), and proved that Laine was as big a hit-maker as ever. His last single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart (peaking at No.86 national) was [...] "Dammit Isn't God's Last Name".|$|E

2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
