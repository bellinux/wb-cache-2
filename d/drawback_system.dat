40|$|ABSTRACTThis research, of {{descriptive}} nature, {{aimed to}} know how the <b>drawback</b> <b>system</b> was managed. For this, the performance of logistics activities between Micro and Small Sized Enterprises (MSEs) and Medium and Large Sized Enterprises (MLEs) of the mechanic capital goods sector was compared. Based on integrated logistics management, it utilized of semi-structured questionnaires to collect data in a sample of 73 companies. The data, treated by the descriptive statistical and nonparametric techniques of Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-Square (χ 2), showed that of the total of 20 variables, 45 % had different logistics performance, being 15 % favorable to (MSEs) and 30 % favorable to (MLES). From these results, it can be concluded that the influence of the drawback system: a) in the MSEs, it occurred in the stage of supply of imported components or raw materials in the scope of quality and costs, b) in the MLEs it occurred in the stage of support and exportation manufacturing focusing in production efficiency, the development of new foreign markets and clients, finally, the compensating contribution margin.

40|$|In {{the class}} of systems with linear {{precoder}} and zeroforcing (ZF) DFE for zero-padded MIMO frequency selective channels, existing optimal transceiver designs present two major drawbacks. First, the optimal system requires {{a large number of}} bits to encode the full precoding matrix. Second, the full precoding matrix leads to complex computations. These disadvantages become more severe as bandwidth (BW) efficiency increases. In this article, we propose using the block diagonal geometric mean decomposition (BD-GMD) technique to design an alternative transceiver. The proposed ZF-BD-GMD system uses a block diagonal orthogonal precoder matrix structure to reduce the required number of encoding bits and simplifies the computation. While solving the current optimal <b>system’s</b> <b>drawbacks,</b> the ZF-BD-GMD <b>system</b> also produces a similar bit error rate (BER) performance when the block size is large. In other words, the ZF-BD-GMD system is asymptotically optimal in {{the class of}} communication systems with linear precoder and ZF-DFE receiver. ...|$|R
