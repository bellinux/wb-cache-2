5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and <b>environmental</b> <b>quality.</b> When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to <b>environmental</b> <b>quality.</b> An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} a vertical differentiation model {{to study the}} competition and environmental effects of multiplicity of eco-labels within a given market. The {{focus is on the}} informational content of multiple eco-labels {{and whether or not they}} reflect the <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> the labels purport to represent. Two settings are considered. In the first setting, which represents the benchmark, we assume information is complete (consumers know the true <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> of the eco-labeled goods). In the second setting, information is incomplete but consumers use price as a signal for <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities.</b> Our results show that when information is complete, introduction of a second eco-label in a market improves the <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> of eco-labeled goods. When information is incomplete, introduction of a second label leads to a rise in prices and a reduction in the <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> of the goods. The latter setting requires specific regulation whereby information must be revealed by a benevolent social planner. ...|$|R

5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Quality</b> (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, {{and federal}} governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Quality</b> (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83percent of the basin; another 6percent is grassland, 3percent shrub, and only 0.2percent wetland.

The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on <b>Environmental</b> <b>Quality</b> has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} innovations {{for both}} income {{growth and the}} generation of better <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities.</b> This is possible in theory but progress in practices is slow. We argue that social pressures to contain pollution were effective insofar they invoked environmental policies all over the world, which enabled to reduce pollution in some countries at decreasing costs. This is achieved {{in the past five}} decades despite fierce resistance of vested interests in industries and policymaking. Economies are still extremely wasteful but there is progress in many countries toward ecoefficiency, which is illustrated for the European Union. In the future, a growing demand for sustainability is expected. This demand is not primarily because of costly natural resource in consumption, they decrease in real prices, but due to the changes in social structures towards more knowledge work and growing leisure time. The knowledge work and leisure time require more personal interactions even though the labour costs increase and more <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> through cleaner production and consumption. These demands invoke innovations that blend <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> with artefacts. Such natural blends are highly demanded and the qualified blends are highly paid. Sustainable innovations through blending of natural and cultural attributes are in progress. Innovators become a driving force for sustainability and the innovative networks key elements for the resulting outcomes. These networks entail distributed business models. <b>Environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> constitute highly demanded values. The challenge is to translate this social sense of urgency into new policies and market arrangements in support of innovators for sustainable development.

40|$|Abstract: How much is a wildflower worth? Inspired by “The {{worth of}} a songbird” by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1994) {{we use the}} value of a wildflower as symbol of the {{complexity}} of evaluating <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> and risks. We critically discuss the application of cost-benefit analysis in evaluating environmental impacts of adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We argue that costbenefit analysis should be supplemented with other methods, such as processes for assessing uncertainty, accommodation of scientific disagreements, and integration of stakeholders’ interests and perspectives. A more inclusive perspective is to develop precautionary approaches that recognize the multidimensional nature of <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> and risks, such as irreplaceability, irreversibility, uncertainty and complexity. Precautionary approaches can contribute to develop a stronger environmental responsibility within the framework of rational self-interest.

The estimated values vary significantly between linear field elements and grassland types, where stone walls and oak-wooded pastures, respectively have the highest marginal WTP. Highly valued <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> are biodiversity, visibility and absence of brushwood. Reference points were included to capture preference heterogeneity. The study cannot reject that respondents may value environmental service levels based on their reference points. agri-environmental policy, use values, prospect theory, reference dependency, valuation,...|$|R
