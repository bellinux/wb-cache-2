60|$|Of {{the science}} of poisons, however, he knew {{absolutely}} nothing, and as the waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, he examined the book-shelves himself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound edition of the Pharmacopoeia, {{and a copy of}} Erskine's Toxicology, edited by Sir Mathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, and one of the oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected in mistake for somebody else; a contretemps that so enraged the Committee, that when the real man came up they black-balled him unanimously. Lord Arthur was a good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books, and had begun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at Oxford, when in the second volume of Erskine, he found a very interesting and complete account of the properties of aconitine, written in fairly clear English. It seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted. It was swift-- indeed, almost immediate, in its effect--perfectly painless, and when taken {{in the form of a}} <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule,</b> the mode recommended by Sir Mathew, not by any means unpalatable. He accordingly made a note, upon his shirt-cuff, of the amount necessary for a fatal dose, put the books back in their places, and strolled up St. James's Street, to Pestle and Humbey's, the great chemists. Mr. Pestle, who always attended personally on the aristocracy, was a good deal surprised at the order, and in a very deferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being necessary. However, as soon as Lord Arthur explained to him that it was for a large Norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of, as it showed signs of incipient rabies, and had already bitten the coachman twice in the calf of the leg, he expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful knowledge of Toxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.|$|E

40|$|The {{protease}} inhibitor Lopinavir (LPV) combined with low dose ritonavir (r) {{in the formulation}} of a soft <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> (SGC) has been widely used in antiretroviral therapy and has been shown to produce safe therapeutic plasma levels. In June 2006, the LPV/r combination was approved as a tablet (TBL) in Germany and since then has replaced the capsule form. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze and compare pharmacokinetics of Lopinavir both in the new meltrex tablet formulation and the LPV/r soft <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> during long-term treatment of HIV. Methods: Included in this study were all patients followed at multiple study centers between January 2003 and August 2007 for whom LPV plasma levels were archived during therapeutic drug monitoring. A total of 4010 LPV plasma levels from 721 patients met these inclusion criteria. From these, those patients for whom complete data sets were missing were excluded from the study. Complete data sets were defined as those data that included information regarding cumulative daily dose, the patient’s anti-retroviral drug regimen, and the time of measurement after drug intake. A total of 571 LPV plasma levels from 138 patients met the full criteria for inclusion in this retrospective study. Additionally, a small prospective study of LPV plasma levels in 6 patients with 24 data points was conducted in order to increase the reliability of this report. Results: At 3 h after dosing, plasma levels of LPV were significantly higher in patients who had received the meltrex tablet (Mdn = 10030 ng/ml, min = 3323, max = 17280) compared to those who had received the soft <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> (Mdn = 7964 ng/ml, min = 120, max = 17900). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). There were no statistically significant differences between the LPV plasma levels of the tablet and the capsule at 6, 9 and 12 h after dosing. Additionally, there were no differences between the trough levels of LPV in the two formulations. However, great variances of plasma levels were detected at time 12 h after dosing for both treatment groups (s(capsule) = 3213 ng/ml, s(tablet) = 2273 ng/ml). Conclusion: The LPV/r tablet formulation is able to produce equivalent to significantly higher plasma levels of LPV when compared with the SGC formulation at time 3 h after drug intake.

The process variables studied were the ratio between the feed flow rate of the coating suspension to the spouting gas flow rate (W(s) /W(g)), the mass of capsules loaded to the equipment (M(0)), and the ratio between the Spouting gas flow rate to the gas flow rate at minimum spouting condition (Q/Q(ms)). The response variables were the rate of increase of the capsules mass (K(1)), and the adhesion efficiency (eta). The linear regression equation for the dependent variable K, in terms of the independent variables adequately described the process with an r(2) value of 0. 872. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that increasing of W(s) /W(g), Q/Q(ms) and gamma significantly increased the adhesion efficiency.

Eggs/larvae of O. cornuta, provided with their maternal provision, were placed inside <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsules.</b> The following groups, {{each of them}} exposed to a different treatment, were established: 30 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Stroby ® at field dose (14 g/hl); 29 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Cuprocaffaro/WG ® at field dose (100 g/hl); 29 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Tecomag ® at field dose (400 cc/hl); 30 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl of deionised water (untreated control); 20 eggs/larvae were left on their maternal provi-sion and transferred in <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsules,</b> thus acting as non-manipulated control. The toxic impact of the three pesticides has been evaluated by recording and comparing the final mortality in each group, i. e. percent larvae that did not finish cocoon spinning.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of missing teeth by osseointegrated dental implants is a commonly utilised treatment option in dentistry. However, successful treatment outcomes {{are dependent on}} sufficient bone quantity in the proposed surgical site for implant placement (Buser et al., 2004). Surgical augmentation of bone defects is commonly performed prior to or during implant placement. Bone augmentation procedures of the maxillary sinus or guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures of alveolar ridge defects have utilised a variety of bone graft materials in block or particulate form, either alone or in combination with resorbable or non-resorbable barrier membranes. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether Hydroxyapatite β-Tricalcium Phosphate (HA-TCP) either alone or combined with Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD) or recombinant human Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) is osteoinductive when implanted into a nonosseous site. Methods: Twenty CD- 1 adult male mice underwent intramuscular implantation into both hindlimbs of an empty <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> or a <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> containing one of the following: 10 mg of uncoated particulate HA-TCP, (Straumann Bone Ceramic®, HA-TCP), EMD coated HA-TCP, (Emdogain®, HATCP + EMD) or rhPDGF-BB coated HA-TCP (HA-TCP + PDGF). Ten animals were sacrificed at four and eight weeks with five specimens from each group retrieved at each time point. The area of graft placement was radiographed and after graft retrieval, a semi-quantitative histological examination was performed with the aim of assessing the inflammatory changes, reparative processes and osteoinduction within the graft site. Results: At both 4 and 8 weeks, histological analysis failed to demonstrate any osteoinductive activity in any of the specimens from the three experimental groups. A minimal chronic inflammatory response and foreign body reaction was seen in the experimental groups which reduced over time. The particles were embedded within fibrous connective tissue and were encapsulated by a dense cellular layer consisting of active fibroblasts and occasional macrophages with the thickness of this layer decreasing over time. At 4 weeks, a greater density of the fibrous connective tissue was demonstrated in the HA-TCP + EMD group (P< 0. 001) while a greater thickness in the capsule thickness was seen in the HA-TCP group (P= 0. 022) although no differences were seen after 8 weeks. Greater neovascularisation was seen in the HA-TCP + PDGF group after 8 weeks (P= 0. 043) while greater amounts of adipose tissue surrounding the particles were detected in the HA-TCP + PDGF group at 4 weeks (P= 0. 002) and in the HA-TCP + EMD group at eight weeks (P= 0. 002). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the use of commercially available HA-TCP alone or in combination with EMD or rhPDGF-BB is biocompatible but not osteoinductive in the murine model.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} pellet size and fibrous diet on intestinal passage time of feed in the digestive tract of broilers. A total of 64 day old chicks were used in a completely randomized factorial design with two different diets (copra meal and corn-soy based diets) and two pellet size (fine and coarse). On day 1 - 5 of week seven, the birds were fed the experimental diets. On day 6, after a 12 h feed restriction, all birds were orally administered with 85 mg chromium oxide in a <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule.</b> Four birds per treatment were killed by cervical dislocation. Gizzard and small intestine were weighed and opened. The colour of the digesta observed to visually determine the location of the chromium oxide. The faeces were observed for first appearance of entire coloured faeces and then on an hourly basis up to the disappearance of coloured faeces. The experimental design was a two way factorial with two basal diets and pellet sizes. Data indicated that a copra meal diet moved in the digestive tract was slower than a corn-soy diet. The first appearance of the marker in the faeces of birds fed the copra meal diet was 52 min later than for those fed the corn-soy diet. The movement in the digestive tract of the fine ground diets was slower than that of the coarse diets. The effect of pellet size on feed passage time was only evident in the copra meal based diet...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effects of caffeine supplementation on sprint cycling performance and to determine if there was a dose-response effect. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 17 well-trained men (age: 24 ± 6 years, height: 1. 82 ± 0. 06 m, and body mass(bm) : 82. 2 ± 6. 9 kg) completed 7 maximal 10 -second sprint trials on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Apart from trial 1 (familiarization), all the trials involved subjects ingesting a <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsule</b> containing either caffeine or placebo (maltodextrin) 1 hour before each sprint. To examine dose-response effects, caffeine doses of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg·kg bm− 1 were used. There were no significant (p ≥ 0. 05) differences in baseline measures of plasma caffeine concentration before each trial (grand mean: 0. 14 ± 0. 28 μg·ml− 1). There was, however, a significant supplement × time interaction (p < 0. 001), with larger caffeine doses producing higher postsupplementation plasma caffeine levels. In comparison with placebo, caffeine had no significant effect on peak power (p = 0. 11), mean power (p = 0. 55), or time to peak power (p = 0. 17). There was also no significant effect of supplementation on pretrial blood lactate (p = 0. 58), but there was a significant time effect (p = 0. 001), with blood lactate reducing over the 50 minute postsupplementation rest period from 1. 29 ± 0. 36 to 1. 06 ± 0. 33 mmol·L− 1. The results {{of this study}} show that caffeine supplementation has no effect on short-duration sprint cycling performance, irrespective of the dosage used...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of solutions that prevent dehydration or promote adequate re-hydration {{play a vital}} role in preventing fatigue during exercise, however, the methods commonly used to assess the hydration ability of such solutions are invasive and often assess the components of absorption separately. This paper describes using a non-invasive deuterium tracer technique that assesses gastric emptying and intestinal absorption simultaneously to evaluate the uptake of water during rest and exercise. The kinetics of absorption are further examined by mathematical modelling of the data generated. For the rest group, 0. 05 g/kg of body weight of deuterium, contained in <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsules,</b> was ingested with ordinary tap water and saliva samples were collected every 5 min for one hour while the subject remained seated. The deuterium was administered as above for the exercise group but sample collection was during one hour of exercise on a treadmill at 55...|$|R

While each worm may produce as many as six deep lacerations or numerous shallow ones per day, repair of these sites occurs quickly, precluding ulceration with persistent bleeding. Hemor rhage associated with attached hookworms when numerous may be of considerable impor tance; upon detachment of the parasites, however, the transience of the lesions renders blood loss and impaired absorptive function of relatively secondary importance in the pathogenesis ofhookworm anemia. A diagnosis of hookworm disease is frequently based on finding large numbers of eggs of the parasite in the feces of patients with depresse...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of a co-processing technique for improving the manufacturing properties of Maytenus ilicifolia (Schrad.) Planch., Celastraceae, and Cassia angustifolia Vahl, Fabaceae, extracts in order to obtain tablets containing a high dose of such extracts. An experimental mixture design was used to optimise the formulation composition. Flowability parameters, such as compressibility index, time flow and angle of repose, were determined. Additional important industrial parameters, such as granulometry, bulk density and moisture stability, were also studied. The results demonstrated that co-processing technique was able to improve the flowability of vegetal extracts, making these materials suitable for a direct compression process. The contour plots revealed that formulations with a higher amount of lactose produced the best flow results as well as a larger particle size and a greater bulk density. Tablets from co-processed extracts containing lactose as majority diluent showed appropriate physical-chemical characteristics and presented a more stable moisture sorption behaviour compared to commercial <b>gelatine</b> <b>capsules...</b>|$|R
