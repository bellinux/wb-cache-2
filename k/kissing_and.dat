Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of <b>kissing</b> <b>and</b> feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the mouth, have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E
5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as <b>kissing</b> <b>and</b> leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food from mother to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of <b>kissing</b> <b>and</b> premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E
5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding.

Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of <b>kissing</b> <b>and</b> French kissing.|$|E

40|$|Background: The neuropeptide <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> its {{receptor}} KissR are key-actors in {{the brain}} control of reproduction in mammals, where {{they are responsible for}} the stimulation of the activity of GnRH neurones. Investigation in other vertebrates revealed up to 3 <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> 4 KissR paralogs, originating from the two rounds of whole genome duplication in early vertebrates. In contrast, the absence of <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR has been suggested in birds, as no homologs of these genes could be found in current genomic databases. This study aims at addressing the question of the existence, from an evolutionary perspective, of the Kisspeptin system in birds. It provides the first large-scale investigation of the Kisspeptin system in the sauropsid lineage, including ophidian, chelonian, crocodilian, and avian lineages. Results: Sauropsid <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR genes were predicted from multiple genome and transcriptome databases by TBLASTN. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses were performed to classify predicted sauropsid <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR genes and to re-construct the evolutionary scenarios of both gene families across the sauropsid radiation. Genome search, phylogenetic and synteny analyses, demonstrated the presence of two Kiss genes (<b>Kiss</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kiss</b> 2 types) <b>and</b> of two KissR genes (KissR 1 and KissR 4 types) in the sauropsid lineage. These four genes, also present in the mammalian lineage, would have been inherited from their common amniote ancestor. In contrast, synteny analyses supported that the other <b>Kiss</b> <b>and</b> KissR paralogs are missing in sauropsids as in mammals, indicating their absence in th...|$|R

Courtship, which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication gestures to tell each other to come nearer and nearer until we touch.

25|$|For HSV-2, {{subclinical}} shedding {{may account}} {{for most of the}} transmission. Studies on discordant partners (one infected with HSV-2, one not) show that the transmission rate is approximately 5 per 10,000 sexual contacts.

JAMA. 2001;285(24):3197) Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a yeast infection. HSV-1 is often acquired orally during childhood.
