The club appealed to Ombudsman for Public Administration, who determined that the ministry would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> issue once more. In 2010 the Food Safety Authority stated that the airport was a threat to the water quality and that water quality was a primary public concern, supporting the closing of the airport from 2013. The concession ended in 2013 and a renewal was finally rejected by the city in August 2013. This time the CAA supported the motion of closure, citing reasons of general public interests. The club has not found a new location for its seaplanes.|$|E

He was remanded in custody on 28 December since the offence was committed whilst he was on bail for two prior offences; the presiding magistrate noted [...] "I also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> safety of the public – you lashed out indiscriminately". CCTV showed Barton punching a man twenty times, causing him to lose consciousness, and attacking a teenager, breaking some of his teeth. On 20 May 2008, {{he was sentenced to}} six months in jail after pleading guilty for his part in the December 2007 assault. Barton's cousin, Nadine Wilson, and his brother Andrew Barton also pleaded guilty to their part in the assaults and received suspended sentences. Barton admitted to being an alcoholic and claimed he wanted to achieve [...] "total abstinence" [...] in order to improve his behaviour.

500|$|Finline is a {{different}} kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. [...] There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. [...] Finline is a variation of slot-waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. [...] This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. [...] Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. [...] The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. [...] Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. [...] More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> effect on mechanical support of removing metal. [...] This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design. [...] Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths.|$|E
