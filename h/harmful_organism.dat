40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> into the EU.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms</b> in the root zone of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) was examined by biotesting. For this investigation three locations along the sandy shoreline of The Netherlands were chosen: Voorne, Texel, and Schouwen. At all three locations <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> were detected in sand from stable dunes, {{as well as}} in sand from mobile dunes (degenerated and vigorous A. arenaria, respectively). In beach sand, however, no <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> occurred. Since A. arenaria shows vigorous growth only when it is buried regularly by windblown sand from the beach, it is concluded that this sand deposition enables the plants to escape from <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms.</b> Ammophila arenaria and Calammophila baltica (purple or hybrid marram grass) from the Voorne location were grown outdoors in containers filled with sand from the beach, the mobile dunes, and the stable dunes, and sterilized sand from the stable dunes. Biomass production of both species was highest in sterilized sand from the stable dune, followed by (in descending order) beach sand, sand from the mobile dune, and unsterilized sand from the stable dune. As compared with A. arenaria, however, growth of C. baltica was reduced less and without mortality of cuttings.

50|$|Understanding Müllerian mimicry is {{impossible}} without first understanding aposematism, or warning signals. Dangerous organisms with these honest signals are avoided by predators, who quickly learn after {{a bad experience}} not to pursue the same prey again. Learning is not actually necessary for animals which instinctively avoid certain prey; however, learning from experience is much more common. The underlying concept with predators that learn is that the warning signal makes the <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> easier to remember than if it remained as cryptic as possible (e.g. being still and silent, providing no scent, and being well camouflaged). Aposematism and crypsis are in this way opposing concepts, {{but this does not}} mean they are mutually exclusive. Many animals remain inconspicuous until threatened, then suddenly employ warning signals, such as startling eyespots, bright colors on their undersides or loud vocalizations. In this way, they enjoy the best of both strategies. These strategies may also be employed differentially throughout stages of development. For instance, large white butterflies are aposematic as larvae, but are Müllerian mimics once they emerge from the final stages of development as butterflies.|$|E

In this research, {{the effect}} of {{modified}} bentonite on removing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in ballast water was discussed using HDTMA+ modified bentonite as flocculating material, and Alexandrium tamarense, Nitzchia closterium, and Photobacterium phosphoreum as the objects of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> and also through an observation of the reaction mechanism between HDTMA+ and bentonite with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The result showed {{that there was an}} effective combination of HDTMA+ with bentonite, and the modified organic bentonite possessed a powerful ability to remove <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The removal rate against Alexandrium tamarense within 24 h was greater than 85 % if the dosage of the organic bentonite was 0. 03 g/L; the removal rate against Nitzchia closterium was approximate to 80 % if the dosage was 0. 06 g/L; the luminous intensity could not be displayed by luminescent bacteria under the condition of concentration 0. 30 g/L, and also the original soil with modification did not shown a significant removal effect under the same dosage. Therefore, it was concluded that the conditions such as aging time, organic bentonite’s particle size, and HDTMA+ dosage were the important factors affecting the harmful biological removal efficiency...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for killing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at surface and/or in edge layer of pourable plant products, includes gas and water supplyable chamber (1) with gas flow for isolating and swirling the products and movable source that emits ultraviolet-, electron- /microwave energy in the chamber. The gas flow (3) is directed {{in such a way that}} its effect is partially against the force of gravity. The ultraviolet energy exhibits a wavelength of less than or equal to 230 nm. The source is arranged within the chamber or is integrated in a chamber wall. The gas is a protective gas, an inert gas, air or a reaction product of undesirable chemical reactions such as carbon dioxide. The gas is sterilizable or germ reducible by a mechanism before entering into the chamber, and is heatable by another mechanism. The chamber comprises a reflector (7) formed as electron target for reflecting the energies. The plant products are processed in continuous- and batch processes by members. The chamber inner walls and surfaces areas of the plant products are subjected with the energies, during the isolation and swirling of the products. The flow properties of the gas are adjustable within the chamber. USE - Used for killing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at surface and/or in edge layer of pourable plant products. ADVANTAGE - The devices ensures complete killing of the <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at the surface of the plant products without destroying the vitamins or similar nutrients in the products, in less machine- and energetic expenditure...|$|R

30|$|The {{color of}} the {{heartwood}} of hinoki {{is an important factor}} in its commercial value. In general, the trunk heartwood is pale red, while the branch heartwood is a more vivid shade of red [6]. The pale red {{color of the}} trunk heartwood is due to certain contents and composition of extractable components [7]. Thus, it is likely that the extractable components differ between the trunk and the branch heartwood, since they are different colors. To date, however, there have been no reports on the bioactivity of branch heartwood extracts, although there are many reports on the durability of hinoki as related to extractable compounds in the trunk. At present, branches of hinoki are regarded as waste material. It would be useful, therefore, to develop a method to use this material. In this study, we determined the bioactivities of extracts from branch heartwood of hinoki, and compared them with the bioactivities of extracts from trunk heartwood. Three major wood decay fungi, Trametes versicolor (white-rot), Fomitopusis palustris (brown-rot), and Trichoderma virens (soft-rot) were applied to the antifungal tests. Similarly, a typical zygomycete fungus of Rhizopus oryzae was applied to investigate antifungal activity as non-wood decay fungi.

Survival was quan-titatively assessed on concentrates obtained by washing samples of contaminated materials and centrifuging the washing liquids. The plate count was performed on two semi-selective media, Kelman’s and SMSA. Contamina-tion survived on oak for approximately 4 days and on poplar for 17 days.
