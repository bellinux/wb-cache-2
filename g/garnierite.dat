5|$|Use {{of nickel}} (as a natural {{meteoric}} nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include <b>garnierite,</b> and pentlandite.

40|$|Ni-bearing {{magnesium}} phyllosilicates (<b>garnierites)</b> {{are significant}} Ni ores in Ni-laterites worldwide. The present paper reports a detailed TEM investigation of <b>garnierites</b> from the Falcondo Ni-laterite deposit (Dominican Republic). Different types of <b>garnierites</b> have been recognized, usually consisting of mixtures between serpentine and talc-like phases that display {{a wide range}} of textures at the nanometer scale. In particular, chrysotile tubes, polygonal serpentine, and lizardite lamellae are intergrown with less crystalline, talc-like lamellae. Samples consisting uniquely of talc-like and of sepiolite-falcondoite were also observed, occurring as distinctive thin lamellae and long ribbon-shaped fibers, respectively. HRTEM imaging indicates that serpentine is replaced by the talc-like phase, whereas TEM-AEM data show preferential concentration of Ni in the talc-like phase. We suggest, therefore, that the crystallization of Ni-bearing phyllosilicates is associated with an increase in the silica activity of the system, promoting the replacement of the Ni-poor serpentine by the Ni-enriched talc-like phase. These results have interesting implications in material science, as <b>garnierites</b> are natural analogs of Ni-bearing phyllosilicate-supported synthetic catalysts. Finally, SAED and HRTEM suggest that the Ni-bearing talc-like phase corresponds to a variety of talc with extra water, showing larger d 001 than talc (i. e., 9. 2 – 9. 7 Å), described as “kerolite”-“pimelite” in clay mineral literature...|$|R

50|$|Light colored <b>garnierite</b> is an {{alteration}} of olivine-rich rock to a clay-like mineral poor in nickel, light green to bright green <b>garnierite</b> {{is a result}} of the leaching of manganese oxide, magnesium, nickel and iron from the original dark green <b>garnierite,</b> rich in nickel, which was deposited by groundwater.

50|$|<b>Garnierite</b> is a green mineral, {{ranging from}} light yellow-green to dark green. The color {{comes from the}} {{presence}} of nickel in the mineral structure for magnesium.

Some species of <b>garnierite</b> stick to the tongue and dissolve readily in water or even on the tongue. <b>Garnierite</b> commonly has a colloform texture, typical of minerals that fill open spaces from a solution. In general, darker green garnierites have higher Ni content, higher specific gravity and higher mean index of refraction than lighter green garnierites, which most likely relates to the inclusion of more Ni in the structure.

50|$|Various {{studies have}} {{examined}} the composition of <b>garnierite.</b> In 1964, a study was done on the composition of a talc-like <b>garnierite</b> and found the composition to be close to the compositions of stevensite and sepiolite, but with partial replacement of the Mg content by Ni. In 1973, another study found that chemical analysis of <b>garnierite</b> samples yields non-stoichiometric formulae that can be reduced to formulas like those of talc and serpentine. The authors suggested a talc monohydrate formula of H2O(Mg,Ni)3Si4O10(OH)2 for the talc-like <b>garnierite.</b> A third study found Mg, Si, Fe, Ni and Al in the samples studied. The author determined that the compositions of all of his <b>garnierite</b> samples lie between the serpentine solid solution series and the sepiolite solid solution series. In 2008, yet another study used x-ray diffraction to find the composition of <b>garnierite</b> samples collected at the Falcondo mine in the Dominican Republic. It found that each of the specimens analyzed fell into one of three groups: an Ni-talc to willemseite (up to 25 weight percent Ni) group, an Ni-lizardite to nepouite (up to 34 weight percent Ni) group and an Ni-sepiolite to falcondoite (up to 24 weight percent Ni) group. In 2011, the most recent study performed used Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis to determine the composition of their <b>garnierite</b> samples.

50|$|Based on the ionic radii {{and charge}} alone, Ni2+ should easily {{substitute}} for Mg2+ in octahedral coordination. The fact that Ni readily substitutes for Mg in <b>garnierite</b> explains why as NiO content goes up, MgO content goes down. The nickel in <b>garnierite</b> is not evenly {{distributed throughout the}} structure, but is concentrated in small zones of nickel surrounded by magnesium zones. <b>Garnierite</b> is a layer silicate. The main difference between the serpentine-like and talc-like variants of <b>garnierite</b> is the spacing between layers in the structure, seen in x-ray powder diffraction studies. The serpentine-like variants have 7 Å basal spacings while the talc-like variants have a basal spacing of 10 Å. At 106X magnifications, the 7 and 10 Å layer spacings (d(001)) are obvious and measureable, with the 7 Å spacings being better defined than the 10 Å spacings. 7 Å, serpentine-like minerals show rod and tube shaped particles, as well as platy particles and fluffy particles that are most likely aggregates while the 10 Å variety shows much less variation in particles, showing only platy and fluffy forms with very few tube or rod shaped particles. Some particles exhibit interstratification of 7 and 10 Å spacings. There is no correlation between NiO content and {{the shapes of the}} particles in the mineral. 7 Å type garnierites usually resemble chrysotile or lizardite in their structures, while 10 Å types usually resemble pimelite.|$|E

The Ni-Mg kerolite is a solid solution from Mg-kerolite to Ni-kero-lite (pimelite) with a structure close to the one of talc. The interlayer distance is of ~ 9. 5 Å but with an excess of Mg in octahedral site, a relative deficit of Si in tetra-hedral site and a water content greater {{than the one in}} talc [1 - 4]. These minerals generally occur with a collo-morph texture, marked by a chemical zoning with growing bands characterized by alternative Ni/Mg ratio. However, the structure of these minerals is still not elucidated. Indeed, they form generally poor crystallized mixtures, in particular with interstratified serpentines [2], which makes their study complex. Moreover, the Ni-Mg distribution in octahedral site may be heterogeneous or form clusters at a nanometric scale [5]. The preliminary studies of Villanova-de-Benavent et al. [6] and Cathelineau et al. [7] showed a high sensitivity of the OH stretching and the low wavenumber region to the different mineral phases (talc, serpentine, kerolite).

In a first place, this expert system is planned for lateritic profiles of New Caledonia, known to held nickel. The latter is found in two forms in these profiles. First, nickel can be adsorbed on the surface or inserted {{in the structure of}} goethite (α-FeOOH) present in the limonites and saprolites. Second, Ni may substitute Mg in different silicates of saprolite, like in <b>garnierite,</b> known to be nickel-rich and corresponding to a mixture of phyllosilicates usually occurring as vein or porosity filling. The SOLSA system will combine several analytical techniques, such as XRD, XRF, Raman spectroscopy, RGB or hyperspectral, and the data collected will be compared to an internal library in order to identify the several minerals present in the lateritic profiles. Therefore, the elaboration of a comprehensive library, taking into account the influence of chemistry on the different signals, is mandatory. Thus, our study focuses on the evolution of the hyperspectral signal (400 - 2500 nm) with the quantity of nickel for several Ni-bearing silicates present in the lateritic profile. Among the results, nickel influences the behaviour of the doublet in the 1380 - 1405 nm region for the specific mineral association constituting the <b>garnierite.</b> References: Faust, G.
