50|$|Boomphones is a {{producer}} of audio products based in Los Angeles, California. The company was founded in 2005 by entrepreneurs, Ira Strasberg and Ohad Einbinder, and primarily produces an original product under the brand Boomphones. Boomphones products {{are the first to}} function as both a <b>headphone</b> <b>set</b> and a boombox, with the option to play music privately in traditional headphone mode or share music out loud via the boombox feature. Products are targeted toward the outdoor action sports demographic (skateboarders, etc.) as well as urban music, fashion, and creative consumer markets.|$|E

50|$|Sensory {{hearing loss}} often occurs as a {{consequence}} of damaged or deficient cochlear hair cells. Hair cells may be abnormal at birth, or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage, including noise trauma, infection and ototoxic drugs, as well as intrinsic causes, including genetic mutations. A common cause or exacerbating factor in sensory hearing loss is prolonged exposure to environmental noise, for example, being in a loud workplace without wearing protection, or having <b>headphones</b> <b>set</b> to high volumes for a long period. Exposure to a very loud noise such as a bomb blast can cause noise-induced hearing loss.|$|R
5000|$|Working {{out of two}} nearby {{locations}} in the early 1970s - one housing Koss TV-Rental, which also did electronics and musical instrument repairs - and their main facility two blocks to the east - Koss pioneered the high-end [...] "electro-static" [...] "ES series" [...] headphone market. These <b>headphones</b> <b>set</b> the standard for wide-range frequency response. Being very durable, they required service for {{wear and tear on}} cords and ear pads - and K&M Electronics (Klenworth & Midwest based in Minneapolis), working out of the TV Rental location, supported the repair efforts, mainly of headphones that came in by the case from those customer locations. Koss headphones were easy and cost-effective to repair. At this site, in a separate garage setup, the musical instrument and electronics repair was done. The TV-rental and repair site was managed by John's brother Pete Koss. Eventually Koss dominated the headphone market, competing mainly with Telex. Koss however was considered a higher quality unit at the time, offering a wide line of models. Growth in the late 1970s caused them to move to their present location {{on the north side of}} Milwaukee.|$|R
5000|$|Much of Molloy's displeasure in her {{new world}} {{originated}} from snobbish Courtney, who couldn't be bothered with another precocious little sibling, and from day one was constantly at odds with Molloy. Paul and Lynn mediated when called for, and at times, Jason served as an ally to Molloy in her competition with Courtney (mostly he kept to himself, inside the ever-present <b>headphone</b> <b>set</b> he wore at the kitchen table). A silver lining to the new arrangement was Paul's new job as program director and producer at local KQET-TV. He oversaw the production of Wonderland, a children's variety show, in which Molloy earned a regular part. Her co-stars on Wonderland were a mixed group of child and adult actors, including portly veteran performer Simon (I.M. Hobson), who appeared in character as a squirrel, ditsy teenager Sara (Ashley Maw), and hip Louis Duncan Jackson (Bumper Robinson), who fancied himself with the special moniker [...] "D'Uncann" [...] and felt {{he was ready to}} hit primetime.|$|E
40|$|Wearable {{technology}} has become ubiquitous {{in recent years}} due to the miniaturization of circuit electronics and advances in smart materials that can conform to the requirements posed by the human body, behaviour and experience. Sensors of this type are found attached almost to every body segment, capable of delivering signals even in harsh activity scenarios. The reliability and relevance of the physiological data retrieved by wearables have yet to surpass the conventional technologies in the healthcare system today. In this paper we present a small device incorporated inside an <b>headphone</b> <b>set</b> that continuously monitors the ECG, impedance and acceleration of the head. As opposed to most biometric sensors, ECG measurement relies on non-optical methods by capturing the electrical potential around the ear in {{both sides of the}} head, whereas impedance monitoring involves AC stimulation instead of DC, the latter commonly involved in skin galvanic response estimation. Signal processing of impedance parameters is performed in situ using a fast variant of the Discrete Fourier Transform in order to save computational resources and power expenditure from a microcontroller equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy. Applications that can benefit from this device include cardiovascular and stress level assessment of individuals for whom an hearable is a requirement for work or leisure...|$|E
30|$|In {{the field}} of second {{language}} acquisition (SLA), a teaching technique known as ‘shadowing’ has increasingly been recognized as an effective practice for developing listening skills in Japan. Shadowing refers to an auditory tracking task of simultaneous repetition of heard native speech through a <b>headphone</b> <b>set</b> (Lambert 1992); which had been originally used as a training method for simultaneous interpreters, as it requires a high competency of both listening and speaking skills occurring at the same time. This act of simultaneous listening and speaking is not only unique to shadowing, but often occurs in our daily lives in a form of inner voice, or sub-vocalization, in the phonological loop of working memory in the brain (Baddeley 1992). This sub-vocalization typically occurs when thinking aloud, repeating the interlocutor’s speech in mind, or even reading a book to process the linguistic information inside the brain. This sub-vocalization is the very key feature of the shadowing technique since it activates high level of intended attention in the working memory. Tamai (1997), the pioneer of shadowing research in Japan’s English as a foreign language (EFL) context, re-defined Lambert’s definition of shadowing as a training technique of listening which the learner attempts to repeat the incoming information simultaneously as exactly as possible while listening attentively to the heard speech (pp. 105 – 106).|$|E
2500|$|The {{moving coil}} driver, more {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "dynamic" [...] driver is the most common type used in headphones. [...] It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the <b>headphone</b> which <b>sets</b> up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. [...] A voice coil, a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like. [...] When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate back and forth. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air producing sound waves.|$|R
5000|$|CMSS-3D Headphone: When the Creative Control Panel is <b>set</b> to <b>Headphones,</b> this <b>setting</b> creates virtual 3D {{positional}} audio via synthesized binaural cues (see Sound localization and Head-related transfer function). If {{the application}} generating the audio uses a hardware-accelerated 3D audio API (i.e. DirectSound3D or OpenAL), the input for the binaural synthesis algorithms consists {{of up to}} 128 sound sources positioned arbitrarily in 3D space, {{this is the most}} accurate utilisation of CMSS-3D. If the application instead generates multi-channel sound directly (e.g. a media player app or a game with software-based audio processing), the input for the binaural synthesis algorithms consist of the 4 to 7 positional sound sources associated with the application's selected speaker configuration. Such applications may use the Speakers settings defined by Windows in which case it is possible to set the Windows Speakers configuration to a multichannel set-up, e.g. 5.1, so that the application will output multi channel audio.|$|R

50|$|In {{practical}} use, {{a series}} circuit {{is made of}} the detector, headphones, and a battery with a potentiometer. The wire is made positive, and the signal to be demodulated is applied directly to it; a small (about 5 ml) platinum cup filled with either sulfuric or nitric acid completes the headphone circuit, and is also connected to ground to complete the signal circuit. To adjust the cell, {{the point of the}} wire electrode is dipped into the electrolyte and the potentiometer adjusted until a hissing noise is heard in the <b>headphones.</b> The potentiometer <b>setting</b> is then moved to reduce the current until the noise just ceases, at which point the detector is in its most sensitive state.|$|R

2500|$|Springfield {{consistently}} {{used her}} voice to upend commonly held beliefs on the expression of social identity through music. She did this by referencing a number of styles and singers, including Martha Reeves, Carole King, Aretha Franklin, Peggy Lee, Astrud Gilberto, and Mina. Springfield instructed UK backup musicians to capture the spirit of US musicians and copy their instrumental playing styles. However, {{the fact that she}} could neither read nor write music made it hard to communicate with session musicians. In the studio, she was a perfectionist. Despite producing many tracks, she did not take credit for doing so. During extensive vocal sessions, she repeatedly recorded short phrases and single words. When recording songs, <b>headphones</b> were typically <b>set</b> as high in volume as possible – at a decibel level [...] "on the threshold of pain".|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a {{navigation}} assistant for visually impaired people, which uses computer vision techniques and is integrated on a wearable device. The system makes it possible to detect and recognize, in real-time, both static and dynamic objects existent in outdoor urban scenes without any a priori knowledge about the obstruction type or location. The detection system is based on relevant interest point extraction and tracking, background/camera motion estimation and foreground object identification through motion vectors clustering. The classification method receives as input image patches extracted by the detection module, performs global image representation using binary VLAD and prediction based on SVM. The feedback of our system is transmitted to visually impaired users through bone-conduction <b>headphones</b> as a <b>set</b> of audio warning messages. The entire system is fully integrated on a regular smartphone.

5000|$|Following the appeal, {{the first}} 100 crystal radio sets made by Burne-Jones & Co Ltd were issued to blind {{people at a}} cost of 31/6d per <b>set.</b> <b>Headphones</b> cost 7/3d a pair. [...] Winston Churchill made another Appeal at Christmas in 1930 asking for a further £20,000 to provide another 10,000 people with radios. He {{reminded}} listeners that it had been a year since he first appealed for the cause and wondered whether the year had gone quickly for blind listeners. He said that wireless brought the blind each night a pageant before their mind's eye. [...] "That mysterious lamp of inner conscientiousness will be continually fed by your unfailing care. The blind will hear, and by hearing, see." [...] By 1931, £37,000 had been raised and 17,000 radio sets provided to blind listeners. In 1932 Lord Snowdon made the appeal, asking for donations to provide 2,000 more blind people with sets. James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister between 1931 - 1935, continued the tradition and appealed for additional funds on behalf of British Wireless for the Blind Fund from his home in Lossiemouth on Christmas Day 1933.|$|R
40|$|Conducting {{tests of}} psychoacoustic nature {{is a common}} task when {{investigating}} {{the capabilities of the}} auditory system. To be able to set up and conduct test of this kind an implementation in Java has been created. The program implements the common m-Interval-n-Alternative-Force-Choice (mInAFC) presentation method and two test routines; method of constant stimuli and variations of the method of adaptive testing. The program has then been used to examine the frequency resolution of the auditory system. The auditory system of a human can be visualized as an array of bandpass filters, each tuned to a certain frequency. The width of these filters determines the frequency resolution of the auditory system. One method to investigate this property is the notched-noise method. Tests has been conducted according to the notched-noise method at 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz employing 3 I 3 AFC and the adaptive 2 -down- 1 -up routine. The results correspond well to earlier published results at the lower frequencies. At 2 kHz the results indicate more care has to be taken to the properties of the ear and <b>headphones</b> either when <b>setting</b> the properties of the noise or when analyzing the data. The implementation in Java provides a general tool for setting up and conducting psychoacoustic experiments on any computer with a sound card and the Java runtime engine installed...|$|R
40|$|Binaural audio {{material}} can be {{presented with the}} use of <b>headphones</b> or a <b>set</b> of loudspeakers. When using the latter, the playback system should compensate for the occurring crosstalk which is done {{with the use of}} crosstalk cancellation filters. A car compartment is considered to be acoustically challenging, for spatial reproduction over loudspeakers, due to the many reflecting surfaces. The thesis set out to investigate suitable loudspeaker positions that might be in favour for a rougher estimation of the cancellation filters, making the system more robust. Another aim was to find a method for filter design. Firstly, a test rig with two loudspeakers was set up to try different loudspeaker positions. When the positions were set, the filters were tuned and tested with the test rig as well as inside a car compartment. Two separate systems were implemented, one behind and one in front of the listener, referred to as back and front system. When the tuning process was completed three user studies were conducted using three different loudspeaker setups: one setup using four similar loudspeakers placed in a listening room, one setup with custom built loudspeakers implemented in a car compartment and the final setup placed inside the listening room using the custom built loudspeakers from the car. The participants were asked to localise virtual source positions generated by either the back or front system. An instrumental evaluation was performed by testing the created filters in a virtual system. Head shadowing and crosstalk performance were studied. Furthermore, a method of filter design was developed along with a measurement script for use with Matlab or Octave. Two of the main findings from the user study are: • The back system was suitable for presenting virtual source positions behind the listener. For source positions in front of the listener most answers resulted in front/back confusions. These tendencies were shown for all tests. • The front system was found to have a more uniform representation of source positions for the tests performed in the listening room. The system inside the car would need further tuning to increase system performance. Keywords: binaural reproduction, 3 D sound, filter design, car HMI, signal processin...|$|R
40|$|While Cohene's earlier works {{sometimes}} {{made the}} spectator {{feel like a}} voyeur onto an intimate relationship, her new works draw us into the action, offering us {{a seat in the}} therapist's office. Comprised of two video installations depicting two different therapy sessions, "I Know You Know" takes psychoanalysis as the inspiration for its format, but the dialogue that unfolds between the therapist (or analyst) and patient (analysand) also concerns itself with one of psychoanalysis's fundamental questions: the problem of freedom-our desire for it, and the complicated, sometimes violent, repercussions of attaining and exercising it. In the first video, Hate You (2014), a female analyst appears on screen, reacting to and conversing with her female patient, who is represented only through the audio track provided by a pair of <b>headphones.</b> The second <b>set</b> of videos, That's Why We End (2012 - 14), show the same composite female analyst, this time treating a male patient who struggles to remember a recent dream. In both scenarios, the viewer is being asked to take the position of the analysand: to not just submerse ourselves into Cohene's cinematic narrative, but to relate to it as another composite character. Looking beyond her usual source materials (movies she saw or could have seen as a child), the new works draw from the catalogue of films mentioned in Gilles Deleuze's Cinema books from the mid- 1980 s, a list of more than 230 movies that the French theorist often wrote about from memory, sometimes mistaking details or recalling the wrong character or dialogue from his time in the movie house. Cohene immediately saw the links between Deleuze's idiosyncratic research process and the tenets of psychoanalysis, where the patient's memories and associations, however partial, can be interpreted as symptoms of larger, unconscious psychic processes. Deleuze's approach to film is in many ways mimicked by Cohene's, insisting that our interpretations of cinema are just as-or perhaps even more-significant than the script's original intent. Working in this way not only allowed Cohene a greater variety of found footage to work with, but also freed her to experiment with media outside of the screen, producing sculptures, a painting and even choreographing a dance piece performed throughout the run of the exhibition. "Trying things I've never done before, like making a painting, became a theme for this body of work without me realizing it," she says. Then, among the Hollywood starlets, and the references to French film theory and psychoanalysis, there are always elements of Cohene's installations that are distinctly personal. Her scents, for instance, are custom-made combinations based on her own smell memories. The nebulizer in Like, Like contains, among its ingredients, amber, bergamot, black pepper, Lenor "April Fresh" fabric softener, neroli and a smell derived from a tiny patch of Cohene's childhood security blanket. In You, Dear(2014), the enormous cluster of onyx grapes at Oakville Galleries, it is the Smell of Real Ass(TM) -a specialty scent Cohene learned of from a friend in Japan-that provides the acrid undertone to a combination of cumin, Cyprus, frankincense and aluminum. "Every detail has tobe accounted for," she says. "The goal is to overwhelm the viewer's senses in order to make sense of them. ...|$|R
