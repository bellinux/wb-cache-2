5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} <b>extend</b> the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to <b>extend</b> their ranges.|$|E

5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to <b>extend</b> it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can <b>extend</b> terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to <b>extend</b> the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} crack {{problem in}} electromagnetothermoelastic multiphase composites (EMTE-MCs) under <b>extended</b> loads is investigated in this paper. Using Green’s functions, the <b>extended</b> general displacement solutions are {{obtained by the}} boundary element method. This crack problem is reduced to solving a set of hypersingular integral equations coupled with boundary integral equations, in which the unknown functions are the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities. Then, {{the behavior of the}} <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities around the crack front terminating at the interface is analyzed by the main-part analysis method of hypersingular integral equations. Analytical solutions for the <b>extended</b> singular stresses, the <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the <b>extended</b> energy release rate near the crack front in EMTE-MCs are provided. Also, a numerical method of the hypersingular integral equations for a rectangular crack subjected to <b>extended</b> loads is put forward with the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities approximated by the product of basic density functions and polynomials. In addition, distributions of <b>extended</b> SIFs varying with the shape of the crack are presented. The results show that the present method accurately yields smooth variations of <b>extended</b> SIFs along the crack front...|$|R

The <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors near the crack front are defined. In addition, a numerical method for a 3 D interface crack problem subjected to <b>extended</b> loads is proposed, in which the <b>extended</b> displacement discontinuities are approximated by the product of basic density functions and polynomials. Finally, the radiation distribution of <b>extended</b> stress intensity factors at the interface crack surface are calculated, and the results are presented toward demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
