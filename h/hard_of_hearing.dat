5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b>|$|E

They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

60|$|When sent to {{turn the}} lambs he walked off to a {{distance}} of about twenty yards, sat down and looked at his master. Caleb hoped he would come round presently when he saw them all at work, and so they did the best they could without him for a time; but the old dog was stiffer and <b>harder</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> than ever, and as they could not get on properly Caleb went at intervals to Tory and tried to coax him to give them his help; and every time he was spoken to he would get up and come to his master, then when ordered to do something he would walk off to the spot where he had chosen to be and calmly sit down once more and look at them. Caleb was becoming more and more incensed, but he would not show it to the dog; he still hoped against hope; and then a curious thing happened. A swallow came skimming along close to the earth and passed within a yard of Tory, when up jumped the dog and gave chase, darting across the field with such speed that he kept very near the bird until it rose and passed over the hedge at the farther side. The joyous chase over Tory came back to his old place, and sitting on his haunches began watching them again struggling with the lambs. It was more than the shepherd could stand; he went deliberately up to the dog, and taking him by the straw collar still on his neck drew him quietly away to the hedge-side and bound him to a bush, then getting a stout stick he came back and gave him one blow on the head. So great was the blow that the dog made not the slightest sound: he fell; his body quivered a moment and his legs stretched out--he was quite dead. Bawcombe then plucked an armful of bracken and threw it over his body to cover it, and going back to the hurdles sent the boy home, then spreading his cloak at the hedge-side, laid himself down on it and covered his head.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} after Katherine leaves town, Stoner becomes ill and seems to age rapidly. As world events like the Great Depression and the Spanish Civil War proceed apace, Stoner rededicates himself to his work. Once more, Stoner sees {{students}} leaving the university to fight in war. For years, Lomax has assigned Stoner no advanced classes to teach. Finally, Stoner begins presenting advanced material to incoming first-year students. Lomax finally relents and begins to assign Stoner advanced classes again. Stoner, older now and <b>harder</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing,</b> is beginning to become a legendary figure in the English department. Stoner begins {{to spend more time}} at home, ignoring Edith's signs of displeasure at his presence. Edith turns her attention to trying to change Grace. After about a month, Edith abandons her assault on Grace. Grace gains almost 50 pounds before her 13th birthday, but at 17, as a high school senior, loses weight and begins to socialize more. Stoner has been saving money for Grace to attend an Eastern college, but Edith will not <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> Grace going away to college. Instead, Grace enters the University of Missouri. The following year, Grace announces she is pregnant. Her mother takes Grace’s pregnancy very badly, but Stoner is supportive. Grace marries the father of her child five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Grace’s husband enlists in the army, and dies before the baby is born. Grace goes to St. Louis with the baby to live with her husband's parents. She visits Stoner and Edith occasionally, and Stoner realizes that Grace has developed a serious drinking problem. Stoner’s mandatory retirement age is now approaching. Stoner wishes to continue teaching as long as possible, though Lomax offers him a promotion to retire sooner. Stoner soon learns he has cancer and must retire immediately. As Stoner’s life is slipping away, his daughter Grace comes to visit him. Gordon Finch visits Stoner almost daily, but Gordon withdraws internally from the dying Stoner. Stoner thinks back over his life. The pain medication he is taking sometimes makes it difficult to think clearly. He thinks about where he failed. He wonders if he could have been more loving to Edith, if he could have been stronger or if he could have helped her more. Later, he thinks he is wrong to think of himself as failing. Then, soon after the cancer is discovered, he dies while touching a copy of the book he published years earlier.|$|R

Individuals who are deaf or <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved access to information in numerous environments.

40|$|Purpose: to {{elucidate}} main principles of complex physical rehabilitation program for senior pre-school age children after cochlear implantation. Material: 40 <b>hard</b> <b>hearing</b> children <b>of</b> senior pre-school (main group) were tested. Main group № 1 consisted <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>hearing</b> children (10 boys and 11 girls), {{who did not}} underwent cochlear implantation and learned by program of pre-school educational establishment for hard-hearing children. Main group № 2 consisted of 19 children after cochlear implantation, registered at oral-aural specialists (10 boys and 9 girls). For them the author’s program of physical rehabilitation was worked out. Comparison group consisted of 40 children with normal hearing (18 boys and 22 girls). Effectiveness of the worked out program was assessed by parameters of physical and psycho-motor condition, by children’s physical qualities. Results: the offered program of children’s physical rehabilitation was developed {{on the base of}} assessment of physical and psycho-motor condition, physical fitness. The program is of complex character and includes the following elements: domestic habilitation, kinetisotherapy methodic (morning hygienic exercises, Yoga for children, health related training complex, fit-ball training, breathing and articulation exercises), massage (general, speech therapy massage), hardening. Conclusions: Complex character of the worked out program implies diverse influence on different disorders in children’s organisms. All these are realized against the background of main etiological factor of these changes (deafness) removal.
