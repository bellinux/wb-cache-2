5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

25|$|Sōjirō is Shishio's {{right-hand}} man, a young assassin {{trained by}} Shishio himself. Sōjirō {{is known for}} his lack of kenki (offensive aura) in a fight, his apparent emotionless state reflected also in his sarcasm and polite manners with his smile hiding his true feelings. However, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a special relationship with Komagata Yumi, who functions as an older-sister figure towards him. Sōjirō usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards.|$|E

On 11 February 2009, the IPL confirmed that Asif had tested positive for steroids and subsequently imposed a one-year ban on him, ending on 21 September 2009.

25|$|Though Leslie {{does not}} possess or {{understand}} some human ideas like love, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> prejudices against others. Charlie tries and fails {{to explain what}} bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He also looks down on humans {{because they do not}} lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah must look odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being difficult when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation is some sort of hallucination.|$|E
25|$|While {{the company}} grew, it {{struggled}} {{to maintain its}} family roots. Esther Snyder died in 2006 {{at the age of}} 86 and passed the presidency to Mark Taylor, former vice president of operations. Taylor became the company's fifth president and first non-family member to hold the position, although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> ties to the family. The company's current heiress is Lynsi Snyder, daughter of Guy and only grandchild of Esther and Harry Snyder. Snyder, who was 23 years old and known as Lynsi Martinez at her grandmother's death, owns the company through a trust. She gained control of 50% of the company in 2012 when she turned 30, and nearly full control at 35 in May 2017.|$|E

He ran the majority of the races for Elmo Langley's #64 team, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> some runs with DiGard Motorsports and Roger Hamby.

25|$|In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in {{subsequent}} {{letters to the}} editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam, 2010) Morgan et al. were supported by some writers, criticized by others; in each case a response by Morgan et al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American Statistician. In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is in {{when he has to}} make his choice) has the same value, , as the unconditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E

Kenny said, [...] "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward". Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, said that Squidward [...] "sounds a lot like Jack Benny". Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying [...] "Jack Benny, no. Although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) goes on Boston's Freedom Trail. He accuses the actor playing John Hancock (Kevin Meaney) that his {{character}} {{did not actually}} set all Americans free. When he tells him [...] "Patriots suck!", he inadvertently says it near a group of New England Patriots fans. At {{the end of the}} episode, Hancock brings in the Crispus Attucks character and tells Tracy <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> black friends. When Hancock says he met Attucks in 1775, Tracy is able to one up him as he knows that Attucks was killed in the Boston Massacre in 1770.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to make Kevin feel better and {{celebrate}} his birthday, Michael takes the employees out ice skating. At the rink, he also runs into his real estate agent Carol Stills (Nancy Walls) and her children. He entertains them, which makes Carol smile. Kevin gets the word that his screening results are negative, to the relief of everyone except Michael, who believes that negative means <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> cancer, and who reacts {{for the first time with}} genuine concern and compassion for Kevin. The gifts are passed out to Kevin and Michael, and the episode ends with Pam recalling that she had fun with Jim and it was a [...] "good day".|$|E

500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little. She hasn't got the {{consultancy}} post. Joseph's father {{is long gone}} and I think she may be nostalgic for all of that. She's hankering after Joseph again. She wants him for herself." [...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her back as she has hurt him too many times.|$|E
500|$|The man is {{positioned}} within an undefined narrow space and {{set against a}} flat black background. Typically for vanEyck, the head is large {{in relation to the}} torso. He is dressed in typically Burgundian fashion, with a red robe and a green wool chaperon with a bourrelet and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet. His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette. Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his [...] "countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian." [...] Though he has neither eyebrows nor stubble, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> eyelashes that are believed to have been added by a 19th-century restorer. Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips, and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on his blue eyes.|$|E
500|$|J. W. Buchanan, {{reviewing}} {{the second edition}} in Physiological Zoology in 1943, described it as [...] "an imposing extension of his earlier attempt to formulate a geometry of Growth and Form" [...] and [...] "beautifully written", but warned that [...] "the reading will not be easy" [...] and that [...] "A vast store of literature has here been assembled and assimilated". Buchanan summarizes the book, and notes that Chapter 17 [...] "seems to the reviewer to contain {{the essence of the}} long and more or less leisurely thesis... The chapter is devoted to comparison of related forms, largely by the method of co-ordinates. Fundamental differences in these forms are thus revealed", and Buchanan concludes that the large [...] "gaps" [...] indicate that Darwin's endless series of continuous variations is not substantiated. But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some criticisms: Thompson should have referenced the effects of hormones on growth; and the relation of molecular configuration and form; genetics is barely mentioned, and experimental embryology and regeneration [...] are overlooked. The mathematics used consists of statistics and geometry, while thermodynamics is [...] "largely absent".|$|E

500|$|Kurt has a close {{relationship}} with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, [...] "Preggers". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together. Kurt has twice fallen in love. The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode [...] "Acafellas", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn. After Kurt hints to Finn of his attraction, their friendship becomes strained as Finn resists Kurt's machinations to get them together. The episode in which Burt defends his son against Finn's name-calling prompted a response from Eric Goldman of IGN, who declared it [...] "one of the heaviest scenes Glee has ever delved into".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Inside Soap, Kirkwood said that Anthony and Tyler would bring a new element to EastEnders, [...] "There's been no shortage of brilliant and sexy women in EastEnders {{over the past few}} years and it was about time there were some blokes to join them. Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Rudy Roughnight (ロディ・ラグナイト Rodi Ragunaito [...] "Rody Roughnight"in the Japanese {{version and}} [...] "Rudy Roughknight" [...] in {{subsequent}} English translations) is a 15-year-old boy from a remote village who was orphaned {{several years before}} the beginning of the game when his grandfather died. Under the care of the town's mayor, Rudy worked as a farmhand for his neighbor until the day a local boy, searching for medicinal herbs to heal his ailing father, became lost in a cave just outside town. Rushing to save him, Rudy eventually finds and rescues the child, yet inadvertently frees a zombie sealed within the cavern. He is able to defeat the zombie and save the village, but alerts the villagers to his forbidden ARM weapon in the process, causing him to be cast out of the village and forcing him to live on his own, returning to the life of an adventurer and Drifter. After severing his own arm (by sword in Wild Arms, and by gun in Wild Arms Alter Code: F), Rudy is discovered to be a Holmcrossan artificial being designed to be a weapon that shares the basic physiology of the Metal Demons, which were terminated since they were labeled as being extremely violent and dangerous. But Rudy was adopted by a man called Zepet, who assumed the role of his grandfather and cared for him, giving Rudy a heart and the capacity to care and love, steering him away from being {{a weapon of mass destruction}} like his brethren. Rudy's character exemplifies the role-playing game archetype of the silent protagonist and is meant to act as the player's extension into the game, though <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> one line in the game.|$|E
