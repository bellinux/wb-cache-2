500|$|According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who {{would become}} the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, [...] "Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it. It made so {{tremendous}} an impression on me that when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Savannah Film Festival, Carlos Serrano of District wrote that though {{the subject matter}} covered a lot of ground, it {{utilized}} an efficient presentation: [...] "Sounds like a lot to put in to one movie, but the film manages to {{make good use of}} its 85 minute running time." [...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a solid film. ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> womb. I looked back up at my mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I {{did not realize that}} they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
