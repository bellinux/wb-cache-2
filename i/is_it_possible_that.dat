The scientific evidence clearly indicates {{that this is not the}} case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years.

That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true {{if it would be}} accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E

[...] The review continued: [...] "To proceed to the execution of the design: we do not hesitate to declare our opinion that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a very superior kind, and such as, if not wasted in premature and negligent exertions, promise a rich harvest of future excellence. Conceptions more lofty and daring, sentiments more commanding, and language more energetic than some of the best passages in this poem afford, will not easily be found:—nor does scarcely any part of it sink to languor; as the glow of feeling and genius animates the whole." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions are subalterns (possibly both are true, and possibly both <b>are</b> false); subcontraries (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are true, but not that both <b>are</b> false); contraries (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are false, but not that both are true); or contradictories (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both <b>are</b> true, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both are false).|$|R

2500|$|A {{foundation}} of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concern about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who {{accused them of}} creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal {{right to bear arms}} as a potential check against tyranny. Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is [...] "a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> ... <b>that</b> an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?"

2500|$|If one is then {{to look at}} the {{interpretation}} (or, meaning), which inheres at the particular time period, the question becomes: why is that reading the essential one?.

Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they indeed entrusted the framers with the authority to draft the constitution; i.e., that the intent of the drafters should remain relevant? [...] Originalism faces hermeneutic difficulties in understanding the intentions of the Founding Fathers, who lived 200 years ago (original intent), or the context of the time in which they lived (original meaning). Justice Scalia accepted this problem: [...] "It's not always easy {{to figure out what the}} provision meant when it was adopted…I do not say [...] is perfect.
