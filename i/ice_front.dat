5|$|In November 1998, Color Air {{introduced}} a new cheapest ticket for NOK345. After the winter settled, the <b>ice</b> <b>front</b> between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their deicing equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport. By the end of 1998, {{it became clear that}} Braathens had increased capacity with 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures, because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million flown seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load.|$|E
25|$|The Larsen D Ice Shelf {{is between}} Smith Peninsula {{in the south}} and Gipps Ice Rise. It is {{considered}} to be generally stable. Over roughly the past fifty years it has advanced (expanded) whereas comparable George VI, Bach, Stange, and Larsen C ice shelves have retreated (to a much greater net extent). The most recent survey of Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front. This makes it difficult to interpret the <b>ice</b> <b>front</b> because the semi-permanent sea ice varies in thickness and may be nearly indistinguishable from shelf ice.|$|E

Landing is only possible at three points, and only during the short period {{of the year in}} which {{the island is}} not surrounded by pack ice. These landings take place on the west side at Kapp Ingrid Christensen, a peninsula which divides the bays Norvegiabukta and Sandefjordbukta. On the cape are some narrow strips of beach, which are suitable for landing. The beach in Norvegiabukta is just [...] wide and is entered via the natural arch Tsarporten. On the west side is a plateau, while the north and south coasts feature ice shelves. The eastern side is the steepest and features two rock columns with flat tops in the sea.|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, several {{ice shelves}} along the Antarctic Peninsula have diminished in size {{as a result}} of climate warming. Using aerial photographic, {{satellite}} and survey data we document a similar retreat of Jones Ice Shelf, which was another small ice shelf on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. This ice shelf was roughly stable between 1947 and 1969, but in the early 1970 s it began to retreat and had completely disappeared by early 2003. Jones Ice Shelf has two <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> only a few kilometres apart and its retreat provides a unique opportunity to examine how different <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> retreat when subjected to similar climate forcing. We mapped the retreat of both the east and west <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> of Jones <b>Ice</b> Shelf and found that, although individual episodes of retreat may be related to particularly warm summers, the overall progress of retreat of the two <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> has been rather different. This suggests that in this case the course of retreat is controlled by the geometry of the embayment and location of pinning points as well as climatic events...|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} North Sea is {{a shallow}} epicontinental sea that was glaciated {{several times during}} the Quaternary. The area is known for its remarkable record of tunnel valleys, the age and origin of which are debated. The recent availability of continuous three-dimensional seismic data between the coasts of Britain and the Netherlands provides the opportunity to establish a new seismic interpretation workflow adapted to the intracratonic glaciogenic successions. By analysing the geomorphology of the buried basal glaciogenic unconformity, four distinct major <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> are identified and correlated onshore. The <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> provide robust relative timelines, and the analysis of tunnel-valley orientations and their merging points indicates that the number of glacial phases has been underestimated. By comparing the erosion capacities of sand and chalk substrates, it is suggested that mechanical abrasion processes are also involved during tunnel-valley genesis. The methods and observations used in this study are applicable to the ancient glaciogenic record in general and constitute a basis for the sedimentological analysis of tunnel valleys...|$|R

40|$|The ocean's {{influence}} {{upon and}} response to Antarctic ice sheet changes is considered in relation to sea level rise over recent and future decades. Assuming present day <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> are in approximate equilibrium, a preliminary budget for the ice sheet is estimated from accumulation vs. iceberg calving and the basal melting that occurs beneath floating ice shelves. Iceberg calving {{is derived from the}} volume of large bergs identified and tracked by the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center and from shipboard observations. Basal melting exceeds 600 cu km/yr and is concentrated near the <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> and <b>ice</b> shelf grounding lines. An apparent negative mass balance for the Antarctic ice sheet may result from an anomalous calving rate during the past decade, but there are large uncertainties associated with all components of the ice budget. The results from general circulation models are noted in the context of projected precipitation increases and ocean temperature changes on and near the continent. An ocean research program that could help refine budget estimates is consistent with goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Initiative...|$|R

2500|$|The Larsen Ice Shelf {{is a long}} {{ice shelf}} in the {{northwest}} part of the Weddell Sea, extending along {{the east coast of}} the Antarctic Peninsula from Cape Longing to Smith Peninsula. In 2005, it covered approximately 78500 km2 of the earth's sea with exceptionally thick ice. It is named for Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, who sailed along the <b>ice</b> <b>front</b> as far as 68°10' South during December 1893. In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast. From north to south, the segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, and Larsen C (the largest) by researchers who work in the area. [...] Further south, Larsen D and the much smaller Larsen E, F and G are also named.|$|E
2500|$|Austin Post {{was one of}} {{the first}} to propose that water depth at the calving margin {{strongly}} affects the rate of iceberg calving. [...] Glaciers that terminate on a morainal shoal are generally stable, but once a glacier retreats into water that deepens as the <b>ice</b> <b>front</b> recedes, calving rate increases rapidly and results in drastic retreat of the terminus. [...] Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: , where [...] is the mean calving speed (m⋅a−1), [...] is a calving coefficient (27.1±2a−1), [...] is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and [...] is a constant (0m⋅a−1). [...] Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982).|$|E
2500|$|The {{retreating}} {{ice sheet}} blocked the northern ends of both glacial lakes, [...] so as Cecil Roseberry describes, [...] "The southern environs are furrowed with rock channels slashed by torrents of glacial meltwater seeking an escape route which they finally found to the Mohawk Valley." [...] These rock channels are now called [...] "the Syracuse channels". Because {{the elevation of}} the land in this region generally decreases from south to north, a series of channels was created by the northerly retreat of the ice sheet; each succeeding channel is lower, and more northerly, than the previous one. Smoky Hollow, which is a gorge lying about a mile south of Clark Reservation, was an early channel created by flows of water from Lake Cardiff into the Butternut trough when the ice sheet still covered the present Clark Reservation. The threshold for water to flow through this channel is at [...] above sea level. As the ice sheet retreated, the waters found a new, lower channel running through Clark Reservation, with a channel threshold of about [...] A waterfall formed, and its plunge pool ultimately became Glacier Lake. As the ice retreated further northward, a still lower channel (Rock-cut channel) was carved where Interstate 481 is currently located (channel threshold of about [...] ). The channels at Pumpkin Hollow, Meadowbrook, and at Green Lakes State Park have the same origins. Roseberry writes, [...] "The abandoned gorges indicate a complex series of glacial rivers parallel to the receding <b>ice</b> <b>front,</b> producing waterfalls when they dropped over north-south ridges." ...|$|E

40|$|The Weddell Sea, {{part of the}} {{circumpolar}} Southern Ocean, {{is probably}} the most remote, least known and least accessible sea in the world. Difficult ice conditions have limited the acquisition of ship data, although this has been partly offset in recent years by access to satellite radar altimetry data. The Weddell Sea was originally defined by the Admiralty Hydrographic Department in 1932 and redefined by the Antarctic Place Names Committee in 1976 (Hattersley-Smith 1991). It is bounded on the western side by the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the southern side by the Ronne and Filchner <b>ice</b> <b>fronts,</b> and on the southeastern side by the Dronning Maud Land and Coats Land coasts of East Antarctica (Fig. 1). The South Scotia Ridge separates the Weddell Sea from the Scotia Sea to the north and a line joining Southern Thule in the South Sandwich Islands and Kapp Norvegia in Dronning Maud Land, separates it from the South Atlantic Ocean to the NE. Within this volume, papers relate to the Weddell Sea as defined above, together with part of the adjoining South Atlantic Ocean up to 50 °E, and to the geology of the once neighbouring continents of Gondwana. The term Weddell Sea embayment is also used informally throughout this volume to include the embayment area to the south of the Weddell Sea now covered by the Ronne and Filchner ice shelves, including Berkner Island, and the continental shelf north of the Ronne and Filchner <b>ice</b> <b>fronts</b> (Figs 1 & 2). ...|$|R

40|$|Rifts in {{ice shelves}} {{accumulate}} a mélange {{of snow and}} firn from above and marine ice from below, material that has been postulated to negatively influence iceberg calving. From measurements and modeling we show that a 100 m wide rift {{near the front of}} the Ross Ice Shelf captures all wind-transported snow traveling in saltation and a substantial fraction of the snow blowing in suspension across the rift. Moderate winds and snow transport appear sufficient to fill the rift in several years, whereas the mélange surface profile remains relatively constant within the 30 m deep rift. Observed subsidence and ocean temperatures in the rift suggest that net basal melting dissolves the mélange from below, limiting its effectiveness as an anti-calving agent near <b>ice</b> <b>fronts...</b>|$|R
