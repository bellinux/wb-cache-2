40|$|ABSTRACT. Sufficient {{syntactic}} {{conditions on}} the defining <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> are found to ensure word problem solvability. If the identities are in the required form, it is shown that finite presentations in the variety can always be modified by a completion algorithm that introduces redundant generators and relations so that the resulting reduction relation is confluent. Introduction. The method of [3] for solving the word problem for (finitely presented) loops and related varieties will be extended to all varieties whose defining identities satisfy certain syntactic conditions. Thus a uniform method for solving the word problem, involving only inspection <b>of</b> the defining <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> a <b>variety,</b> is established.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research {{was to investigate the}} status of rice genetic resources in post-war Sierra Leone using both morphological and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data. Specifically, we aimed at investigating farmers’ rice genetic resources for homogeneity and differentiation, and at examining the genetic <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> similarly named <b>varieties,</b> including varieties within Sierra Leone, and between Sierra Leone and Guinea. This research was also motivated by the assumption that genetic erosion might have occurred {{as a result of the}} civil war. To determine the level of diversity and genetic relationships among farmers’ <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> rice recently collected in Sierra Leone, two methods were used using subsets of the collected samples: (1) Using morphological data, 74 samples <b>of</b> 29 different <b>varieties</b> were analysed to investigate the relationship between (a) varieties grown in two districts in Sierra Leone, and (b) the two main cultivated species, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima. A dendrogram largely clustered the varieties according to region and to the species to which the varieties belonged. (2) Using AFLP data, three separate investigations were conducted: (a) 33 samples <b>of</b> 10 <b>varieties</b> were investigated to evaluate diversity within and between varieties. The results indicated that the rice varieties possess different levels of intra-variety variation, whereas inter-variety diversity was high enough to distinguish one variety from the other. In particular, an AMOVA analysis revealed that 38 % of the total variation occurred within varieties, and 62 % between varieties. (b) 37 samples <b>of</b> 18 different <b>varieties</b> were investigated to determine the consistency <b>of</b> naming <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> by farmers. The results showed that there was consistency in the naming by farmers <b>of</b> traditional <b>varieties,</b> but inconsistency in the naming <b>of</b> newly acquired <b>varieties</b> and cultivars.

This study aimed to identify Indonesian mungbean varieties based on DNA fingerprint profile using a marker set to support morphological characters. A total of 22 Indonesian mungbean accessions were characterized based on 21 morphological traits and 55 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) primers. Of the total 22 mungbean varieties {{used in the present}} study, 16 varieties were improved varieties and remaining six varieties were local varieties originated from Java, Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi collected in GeneBank of ICABIOGRAD.

The selected markers enabled to differentiate each mungbean variety according to their genetic marker with the lowest distance of 0. 125, demonstrating the robustness of the selected marker set as a tool to identify a specific DNA fingerprint profile as a varietal identity (ID).

We show that in general there does not exist an algorithm {{to decide whether the}} growth exponent of a codimension sequence <b>of</b> a <b>variety</b> defined by given finite sets <b>of</b> operations and <b>identities</b> is equal to a given rational number. In particular, we solve negatively a recent conjecture by Bremner and Dotsenko by showing that the set generating series of binary quadratic operads with bounded number of generators is infinite. Then we recall algorithms which in many cases calculate the codimension series {{in the form of a}} defining algebraic or differential equation. For a more general class <b>of</b> <b>varieties,</b> these algorithms give upper and lower bounds for the codimensions in terms of generating functions and asymptotical bounds for the growth of codimensions. The upper bound (based on an operadic version of the Golod [...] Shafarevich theorem) is just a formal power series satisfying an algebraic equation defined effectively by the generators and the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>variety.</b> The first stage of an algorithm for the lower bound is the construction of a Groebner basis of the operad. If the Groebner basis happens to be finite and satisfies mild restrictions, a recent theorem by the author and Anton Khoroshkin guarantees that the desired generating function is either algebraic or differential algebraic. We describe algorithms producing such equations. In the case of infinite Groebner basis, these algorithms applied to its finite subsets give lower bounds for the generating function of the codimension sequence.

40|$|Given the {{preoccupation with}} {{identity}} in recent times, {{it was inevitable}} that the question of Europe would be posed in terms of that concept. The resulting notion <b>of</b> a European <b>identity</b> has led to a confused debate, not because Europe cannot have an identity or because the bearers <b>of</b> such an <b>identity,</b> Europeans, do not exist, but because the very idea <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> in this debate has rarely been clarified. Do we mean a collective <b>identity,</b> a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> interlinking collective <b>identities,</b> an aggregation <b>of</b> personal <b>identities,</b> a broadly defined cultural category, or an official EU cultural or political identity? Whether Europe is unable to compete with national societies because national identities are more real or powerful than collective ones depends on what kind <b>of</b> collective <b>identity</b> we mean when we refer to large-scale social groups or societal complexes having an identity...|$|R

We also discuss ways to apply this result for constructing lattices <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> rings with involution obeying an <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the given type.

40|$|Bicommutative algebras are nonassociative algebras {{satisfying}} the polynomial <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> right- and left-commutativity (xy) z=(xz) y and x(yz) =y(xz). We study subvarieties <b>of</b> the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> all bicommutative algebras over {{a field of}} characteristic 0. We prove that if the subvariety satisfies a polynomial <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> degree k, then its codimension sequence is bounded by a polynomial of degree k- 1. Since the exponent <b>of</b> the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> all bicommutative algebras is equal to 2, this gives that it is minimal {{with respect to the}} codimension growth. Up to isomorphism there are three one-generated two-dimensional bicommutative algebras with one-dimensional square which are nonassociative. We present bases <b>of</b> their polynomial <b>identities</b> and show that one of these algebras generates the whole <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> bicommutative algebras. Comment: LATEX, 14 page...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a general study <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> English—China English and its {{influence}} on English Language Teaching (ELT) for English majors. The status of English as an International language breaks {{the situation in which}} British English or American English is the sole standard. English becomes World Englishes, taking on a plural form, which include many <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> English with nativized cultural, political and economical characteristics. Researchers in China believe that China English as a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> English has been objectively in existence and become a lingua franca. It consolidates the cultural <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese speakers of English, enriches the multiple <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> English and {{plays an important role in}} promoting Chinese culture internationally. For teachers of English majors, it presents challenges to their traditional view of language teaching. </p...|$|R
