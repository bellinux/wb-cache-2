40|$|<b>Dew,</b> as a {{supplementary}} water source, {{may have}} an important ecological role in arid and semi-arid regions. During August and September of 2007 and 2008, measurements were taken to investigate the <b>dew</b> accumulation and evaporation patterns {{in the very early}} morning hours, in three different habitats (dunetop, footslope, and interdune lowland) of a fixed sand dune in Northwest China. <b>Dew</b> quantities were measured using the cloth-plate method. The results indicated that there was a positive correlation between <b>dew</b> amounts and relative humidity, but a negative correlation between <b>dew</b> amounts and mean temperature. Clear mornings were characterized by higher <b>dew</b> amounts and longer <b>dew</b> duration, whereas less <b>dew</b> was recorded during cloudy and especially windy mornings. <b>Dew</b> continued to condense even after sunrise, although a shorter warming time after dawn is also of vital importance in <b>dew</b> formation. The higher average maximum <b>dew</b> quantities (0. 06 mm) and longer average <b>dew</b> duration (2. 3 h) occurred in the interdune lowland; the lower and shorter average <b>dew</b> amounts (0. 048 mm) and duration (1. 9 h) were obtained at the dune top. The footslope habitat exhibited intermediate values. Clearly, the differences in <b>dew</b> deposition can be partially attributed to the distinguishing characteristics of the microhabitats. The present study highlighted the impacts of these characteristics on near-ground <b>dew</b> condensation accumulation and evaporation in a fixed sand dune and may facilitate evaluation of the role of <b>dew</b> in arid and semi-arid environments...|$|R
50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress the {{incoming}} <b>dew</b> point. Most dryers have a challenge air <b>dew</b> point and pressure specification. So if the inlet <b>dew</b> point {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the outlet <b>dew</b> point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F <b>dew</b> point with a challenge of +70 °F <b>dew</b> point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet <b>dew</b> point of only 32 °F, the outlet <b>dew</b> point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet <b>dew</b> point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet <b>dew</b> point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet <b>dew</b> point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dew</b> {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.

500|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 20, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "Here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it. It has for its basis recent cartoons, but has original treatment. The male members of the cast seemed to enjoy their roles, perhaps {{for the reason that}} it is a man's picture; the laugh seems on the ladies." [...] A more contemporary analysis of the film was covered in a paper by Eric Dewberry, who credits this film as Thanhouser's first film portraying suffragists. Dewberry writes that the film presents the idea of a woman mayor, something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous. Despite Jack's lack of power in the new era which he awakes to, he managed to win the heart of a powerful woman and easily restore the rights of men. Taken one way, the film seems to advance the idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts. <b>Dewing</b> writes, [...] "On the one hand it mocks many female suffrage [...] "fighting tactics," [...] as suffragists, in an attempt to not appear too extremist and alienable, exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires. In the film, the man assumes effeminate passions to woo the Mayor. On the other hand, those sympathetic to the cause can see this as proof that these tactics can work in politics. The film also toys with the fears men harbored concerning the loss of power over females in public spaces, a threat to masculinity and manhood." [...] The film is also believed to have been the first adaptation of Curwood's work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dew</b> {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called <b>dew.</b> The <b>dew</b> point is a saturation point. When the <b>dew</b> point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates <b>dew</b> but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The <b>dew</b> point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the <b>dew</b> point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the <b>dew</b> point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant <b>dew</b> point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the <b>dew</b> point determines the specific humidity of the air. The <b>dew</b> point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a simple method to obtain absolute <b>dew</b> determination in any environment, based on observing <b>dew</b> formed at sunrise on cars. Cars {{are used as}} <b>dew</b> condensers where <b>dew</b> yield varies on three different parts that nearly all car exhibits: roof top, windshield and window side. The {{presence or absence of}} <b>dew</b> at the sunrise at these particular positions provides an observation scale index n with 4 levels, which is used to quantify <b>dew</b> yield. We show that the index n is proportional to the condensed <b>dew</b> volume h (mm) as measured on a standard planar condenser, inclined 30 ° from horizontal, following h=Kn. The validation of this scale and the determination of K (= 0. 067 mm within 20 - 30 % uncertainty) is performed with long term experiments in different areas where <b>dew</b> is observed on several cars, either directly weighted on rooftops or calculated from meteo data. This method can thus be of great help to determine without sophisticated measurements or trained observers the <b>dew</b> potential in many places in the world, in particular in arid and semi-arid environment, where <b>dew</b> can help to answer water demand and means to evaluate the <b>dew</b> potential are often limited or lacking...|$|R

40|$|Several {{field studies}} have {{proposed}} that the volatilization of NH 3 from evaporating <b>dew</b> is responsible for an early morning pulse of ammonia frequently observed in the atmospheric boundary layer. Laboratory studies conducted on synthetic <b>dew</b> showed that the fraction of ammonium (NH 4 +) released as gas-phase ammonia (NH 3) during evaporation {{is dependent on the}} relative abundances of anions and cations in the <b>dew.</b> Hence, the fraction of NH 3 released during <b>dew</b> evaporation (Frac(NH 3)) can be predicted given <b>dew</b> composition and pH. Twelve separate ambient <b>dew</b> samples were collected at a remote high-elevation grassland site in Colorado from 28  May to 11  August  2015. Average [NH 4 +] and pH were 26  µM and 5. 2 respectively and were on the lower end of <b>dew</b> [NH 4 +] and pH observations reported in the literature. Ambient <b>dew</b> mass (in g m − 2) was monitored with a dewmeter, which continuously measured the mass of a tray containing artificial turf representative of the grass canopy to track the accumulation and evaporation of <b>dew.</b> Simultaneous measurements of ambient NH 3 indicated that a morning increase in NH 3 was coincident in time with <b>dew</b> evaporation and that either a plateau or decrease in NH 3 occurred once the <b>dew</b> had completely evaporated. This morning increase in NH 3 was never observed on mornings without surface wetness (neither <b>dew</b> nor rain, representing one-quarter of mornings during the study period). <b>Dew</b> composition was used to determine an average Frac(NH 3) of 0. 94, suggesting that nearly all NH 4 + is released back to the boundary layer as NH 3 during evaporation at this site. An average NH 3 emission of 6. 2  ng m − 2  s − 1 during <b>dew</b> evaporation was calculated using total <b>dew</b> volume (V <b>dew)</b> and evaporation time (t evap) and represents a significant morning flux in a non-fertilized grassland. Assuming a boundary layer height of 150  m, the average mole ratio of NH 4 + in <b>dew</b> to NH 3 in the boundary layer at sunrise is roughly 1. 6  ±  0. 7. Furthermore, the observed loss of NH 3 during nights with <b>dew</b> is approximately equal to the observed amount of NH 4 + sequestered in <b>dew</b> at the onset of evaporation. Hence, there is strong evidence that <b>dew</b> is both a significant night-time reservoir and strong morning source of NH 3. The possibility of rain evaporation as a source of NH 3, as well as <b>dew</b> evaporation influencing species of similar water solubility (acetic acid, formic acid, and HONO), is also discussed. If release of NH 3 from <b>dew</b> and rain evaporation is pervasive in many environments, then estimates of NH 3 dry deposition and NH x ([*]≡[*] NH 3  + NH 4 +) wet deposition may be overestimated by models that assume that all NH x deposited in rain and <b>dew</b> remains at the surface...|$|R
