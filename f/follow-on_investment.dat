40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of age on the sale prices of hotel real estate. Value erosion of {{commercial}} property due {{to the passage of}} time may be offset by renovation, although substantial <b>follow-on</b> <b>investment</b> usually occurs several years following construction. Obsolescence produces value losses during the post-construction period prior to new investment that result from technological change (Colwell & Ramsland, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 8 (1), 47 – 63, 2003). A hedonic model is specified to allow age to measure {{the effects of}} obsolescence in hotel prices. Although the long-run obsolescence rate for hotel properties of 1. 93 %/year aligns closely with the rate estimated elsewhere for retail properties, the path of obsolescence through time shows some marked departures. Contrary to the theory and the empirical results from the retail real estate market, hotel prices do not reveal much more obsolescence in the years immediately following construction than later. Also, the age and sale price relation turns positive nearing the third decade of the lives of hotels indicating a vintage effect. Thus, a V-shaped obsolescence function emerges that either may be explained by a fixed-cost renovation expenditure function or a vintage effect produced by the demand for surviving assets. A series of tests of hotel brand-specific obsolescence rates reveals considerable variation in these rates among seasoned properties, perhaps an indication of a convex renovation expenditure function and sequential <b>follow-on</b> <b>investment.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007 Property prices, Hotel real estate, Economic depreciation,...|$|E

We determine a threshold level such that for lower <b>follow-on</b> <b>investment</b> outlays development of both standards is optimal while for higher investment levels development of a single standard is optimal. This threshold is negatively related to the correlation between the value of the two standards. Finally, we show that properly incorporating uncertainty and the interdependence between the payoffs to the two standards leads to significantly different conclusions from standard NPV-analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} venture capital (VC) {{investment}} on innovation and technology commercialization {{as well as}} the influence of market capacity on venture capital firm decision-making has been extensively covered by the existing literature. However, the interdependency between investment that drives technology and investment that drives market capacity has received relatively little attention. Whereas literature suggests that VC investment in technology companies strengthens technology and/or manufacturing efficiency, asset finance investment drives capacity growth and volume in certain technology sectors. We examine interdependencies in investment in technology and capacity by analyzing the relationship between VC investment in solar technology firms and asset finance investment in solar power infrastructure capacity in the US. We find that investment in solar technology drives investment in solar capacity; however, we find no evidence that market growth caused by solar capacity investment induced <b>follow-on</b> <b>investment</b> by solar technology venture capitalists in the US.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of R&D investment projects makes this task especially challenging.

The net present value (NPV) rule and other discounted cash flow techniques (DCF) for making R&D investment decisions seem to be inappropriate to build a portfolio of R&D projects as they favor short term projects in relatively certain markets over long term and relatively uncertain projects. Since many new products are identified as failures during the R&D stages, the possibility of refraining from market introduction may add a significant value to the NPV of the R&D project.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2010. Major: Business Administration. Advisor: Harry J. Sapienza. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 166 pages, appendices A-B. Why do managers embrace some risks while they reject others {{that appear to}} be equally risky? This dissertation examines how risk dimensions influence the decision to hold, reinvest in, or terminate investment in companies within a venture capital portfolio. I draw on prototype theory to argue that reinvestment is more likely in portfolio companies that "look like" successful VC-backed firms, while investment termination is more likely for firms that "look like" losing portfolio companies. Financial risk is an equivocal signal because it can indicate a problem or recur by design in the VC-backed portfolio company. Different levels of market, technology and management risk are all central characteristics of portfolio winners or losers. I predict that increasing financial risk will increase the likelihood of both reinvestment and termination compared to holding the investment. However, market, technology and management risk will negatively influence reinvestment. Regarding investment termination, I argue that less controllable risks will be rejected, while firms with more controllable risk will be retained. Therefore, I predict that market risk and technology risk will positively influence termination, while management risk will have no significant effect. The sample is composed of 542 quarterly observations of 57 companies in an early-stage VC firm's portfolio. The independent variables are the VC's financial, market, technology and management risk assessments. Control variables address fund differences, portfolio company characteristics, cognitive biases, and economic context. The analysis uses multinomial time series logit to compare the likelihood of <b>follow-on</b> <b>investment,</b> investment termination, or profitable sale vs. holding the investment. With the exception of technology risk, the hypotheses are supported. I contribute to the management and entrepreneurship literatures by examining the under-researched area of risk-based decisions subsequent to an initial commitment. I also use a novel combination of prototype theory and behavioral decision theory to show how risk can be decomposed into multiple dimensions with differing effects on decision-making. Furthermore, my analysis goes beyond binary decisions to incorporate several discrete choices. Finally, this study breaks new ground by analyzing nonpublic, contemporaneous records of actual VC post-investment risk assessments and decisions...|$|E
40|$|In IT Portfolio Management, Real Option Analysis (ROA) and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) {{analysis}} {{are often used}} to place a quantitative value on an IT investment. ROA is theoretically superior to DCF analysis because ROA specifically attempts to account for managerial flexibility or the ability of management to adjust to a changing situation. However, while DCF analysis has been criticized as undervaluing IT projects, ROA has been criticized as overvaluing them. One possible explanation for an upward bias in ROA is that it often incorrectly assumes that managers {{will be able to}} make <b>follow-on</b> <b>investments</b> to an IT project if that project is successful, (i. e.

Drawing from complexity theory and using project data from three large private organizations in the Mid-West we found that there was a log-linear relationship between the number of projects and SDLC phase.

40|$|Technology {{innovations}} {{continue to}} be one of the greatest drivers of economic growth. Realizing the value of such innovations, however, requires substantial <b>follow-on</b> <b>investments</b> in development and commercialization. The value of these investments is difficult to capture because of uncertain demand and potential competition. This often leads to difficulties in obtaining outside financing for these investments. In this paper, we explore how licensing contracts can both dissuade other firms from developing alternative technologies and alleviate the financing problem. We develop a model in which a firm that invests in the development efforts of an innovation can license its technology to a potential competitor. A variety of licensing possibilities is considered, including fixed fees, royalty schedules, and two-part licenses consisting of an up-front payment and a capped royalty schedule. When the firm has no financial constraint, a royalty schedule that depends on realized demand dominates a fixed fee per license. When investment funds are constrained, a royalty cap license with an up-front payment can serve as a source of financing. We also study the investment problem conditional on the licensing and financing decisions. licensing, investment under uncertainty, innovations, financing, real options, game theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} private equity {{investing}} has changed significantly as two dynamics have evolved in recent years: portfolio companies {{have begun to}} experience serious financial distress, and general partners have started to diversify and desegregate their investment strategies. Both developments have led private equity shops - once exclusively interested in acquiring equity positions through leveraged buyouts - to invest in other tranches of the investment spectrum, most particularly public debt. By investing now in both private equity and public debt of the same issuer, general partners are generating {{a host of new}} conflicts of interest between themselves and their limited partners, between multiple general partners in the same consortia, and between private investors and public shareholders. In this essay, we identify and explore these various new tensions that have begun to arise in the private equity industry. We then propose and examine an array of possible ways to eliminate or alleviate those conflicts, exploring the regulatory, fiduciary, and pragmatic strengths and weaknesses of each approach. General partners can seek investor unanimity or consent for <b>follow-on</b> <b>investments,</b> but certain tax and practical barriers complicate that approach. Alternatively, they can opt for a range of architectural prophylaxes to protect against conflicts. These add costs on everyone, however, and, experience in related fields shows, they do not work. Investors, for their part, can attempt to diversify their own investment holdings to counterbalance risk, but this still leaves some vulnerable to opportunistic fund managers, and may increase costs for all investors as well. We propose a less costly and more efficient solution: advisers and investors should work together to create a vibrant secondary market for private equity interests to create a salutary exit option, which would in turn discipline the investment behavior of fund managers in this turbulent new investing environment...|$|R
