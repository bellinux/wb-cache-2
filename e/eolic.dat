Lidar is also used to characterise the incident wind resource for comparison with wind turbine power production to verify the performance of the wind turbine by measuring the wind turbine's power curve.

In Guayanilla, biographer Norbeto Lugo and Irvin Sepúlveda have made efforts to foment the study on the pieces. In 2008, interest in the pieces surrounded the 175th Anniversary of the municipality's foundation. It was due to this celebration, where interest in Guayanilla's history peaked, that arrangements were made to have the Collection in public exhibition {{for the first time}} and the first time in decades that the topic returned to the mainstream media. The exhibition took place between March 27 and 28 at the behest of Leandro Hernández, director of the Centro Cultural María Arzola (English: [...] "María Arzola Cultural Center") which also hosted the pieces. The municipal administration of Guayanilla then announced arrangements to have them permanently moved there in order to exhibit them. During the following year, interest in the Collection grew and the municipality began efforts to create the Museo de Epigrafía Lítica Padre Nazario (English: [...] "Father Nazario Museum of Lithic Epigraphy") to emphasize them. Shortly afterwards, the finding became a central argument against the creation of an <b>eolic</b> park in the region. Upon opening, the museum featured a permanent exhibition where 19 pieces of the Collection were on display, among other archeological exhibitions relevant to the municipality. The topic re-entered the mainstream media in April 2016, with coverage related to a conference covering his research that was organized by Zoé Tió.|$|E

We are proposing a online design method to establish control strategies for the the main unit of a <b>eolic</b> system that is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG).

40|$|In {{this work}} we show {{the results of}} a {{resistivity}} tomography performed over the shallow part of a large cave system in the Mt. Armetta karst, Pennavaira valley northwestern Italy.

The cave, whose shallowest part exhibits narrow passages and large chambers, was developed in the Mesozoic sedimentary cover(Caprauna Armetta tectonic unit), an allochtonous nappe characterized by four deformation phases. The main target of the experiment is a region located at about 30 m below surface precisely spotted by ve 235 m long ERT sections. Since cave develops in a windy summit area, the long-term stability of an <b>eolic</b> power plant tower, located over a karst void, is also considered.

40|$|Albanian folk music, {{this great}} {{treasure}} preserved over generations {{is an expression}} of high consciousness of everything precious inherited from the past. In determining the typology of this folklore, Albanian Ethnomusicology rightly refers to two major ethnographic divisions, which, according to the natural boundary defined by Shkumbini River, are Gheg in the northern part and Tosk, south of it. In a general approach (even within these two large ethno music areas, folklore is presented with its striking diversity), it can be said, that: northern folklore, respectively Gheg one, is distinguished for its monodic singing, based on oj- and chromatic modes with 11 sounds, influenced by oriental music, while southern folk music generally appears unified in iso polyphony, which by modal perspective is built on pentatonic (Tole, 2007, 5). The types of degree’s steps that are encountered in Albanian folklore music can be divided in two categories, defined by their own origins. In the first group, the so-called diatonic modes, include older modes, in which did not penetrate the later influences that came from the Orient (when Albanian became part of the Ottoman Empire) (Koçi, 2002, 143), a part of which with ancient origins, like three, tetra, penta and hexachord, while the rest derived from church modes, like eolik and jonic, but also anhemitonic pentatonic. To the other group belong chromatic modes, with oriental origin. Consequently, even the Albanian folk music melody is based on diatonic modes on one hand, where <b>eolic,</b> doric and jonic dominate (and the combination of two modes, <b>eolic</b> and jonic are a rather frequent phenomenon), as well as in defective modes mentioned above {{and on the other hand}} in chromatic modes (Çefa. 1997, 97) ...|$|E
