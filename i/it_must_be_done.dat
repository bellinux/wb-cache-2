As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E

Most recreational scuba diving is done with a half mask and the demand valve is held in the mouth, gripped by the teeth, and sealed by the lips. The air is breathed through the mouth, and the diver {{must be able to}} seal off the nasal passages from the pharynx so that breathing remains possible with a flooded or dislodged mask.|$|E
25|$|Baptists {{subscribe}} to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and {{the autonomy of the}} local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.|$|E

25|$|The {{small size}} of the tree and some dwarfing of foliage result from pruning the trunk, branches, and roots. Pruning is often {{the first step in}} {{transforming}} a collected plant specimen into a candidate for bonsai. The top part of the trunk may be removed to make the tree more compact. Major and minor branches that conflict with the designer's plan will be removed completely, and others may be shortened to fit within the planned design. Pruning later in the bonsai's life is generally less severe, and may be done for purposes like increasing branch ramification or encouraging growth of non-pruned branches. Although pruning is an important and common bonsai practice, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with care, as improper pruning can weaken or kill trees. Careful pruning throughout the tree's life is necessary, however, to maintain a bonsai's basic design, which can otherwise disappear behind the uncontrolled natural growth of branches and leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{feast of}} the Epiphany is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself {{revealed}} to all as father of Jesus and all mankind. It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany. This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan. For the Coptic Orthodox Church {{it is also a}} moment in which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins. Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday during the time of Easter. Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day. The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms. It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water. It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that ask for it, and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> before the beginning of Lent.|$|E

500|$|For this {{operation}} Model had {{at his disposal}} Sixth SS Panzer Army, Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army. These armies, with over 2,000 panzers and 2,000 airplanes [...] represented the last strategic reserve of the crumbling Third Reich. Despite his misgivings, Model threw himself into the task with his usual energy, cracking down on any defeatism he might find. When a staff officer complained about shortages, Model snapped: [...] "If you need anything, take it from the Americans". When Ludwig Heilmann warned Model that his command 5th Parachute Division was only a Class IV outfit, Model, who by now must have been surfeited with complaints on lack of equipment and insufficient training, merely replied that success would be won by the paratroopers' [...] "usual audacity." [...] He remained acutely aware of both the operation's significance, and its most likely outcome. When Colonel Friedrich August von der Heydte, ordered to lead a parachute drop {{as part of the}} operation, said that the jump had no more than a 10 percent chance of success, he replied: [...] "Well, then it is necessary to make the attempt, since the entire offensive has no more than a 10 percent chance of success. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> since this offensive is the last remaining chance to conclude the war favourably." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{speculated that}} Mondale lost support with voters nearly {{immediately}} during the campaign, namely during {{his acceptance speech}} at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated {{that he intended to}} increase taxes. To quote Mondale, [...] "By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did." [...] Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan.|$|E

2500|$|From the start, Coleman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the war in Iraq. In 2008, he was still a supporter of the war, and generally tended to agree with the positions of the Bush Administration on Iraq. He was in favor of the eventual removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but did not believe in any kind of timetable for the removal of troops until the situation in Iraq became more stable. A Minneapolis Post article in August 2008 summarized his position as: [...] "He believes the prospects are good for a drawdown of U.S. troops, but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> based on conditions on the ground as reported by commanders in the field, not according to an 'arbitrary' timetable set for 'political' reasons in Washington." ...|$|E
