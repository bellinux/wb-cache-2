5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without <b>flow</b> <b>separation.</b> This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such <b>flow</b> <b>separation</b> causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from <b>flow</b> <b>separation</b> and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of UHBR (Ultra High Bypass Ratio) engines mounted under backward swept wings may lead {{at low speed}} to local <b>flow</b> <b>separations</b> on the wing suction side {{in the wake of}} the nacelle. These local <b>flow</b> <b>separations</b> can trigger the total wing stall which degrades the total aircraft performance. This paper presents a numerical study of AFC (active flow control) applied at the engine-wing junction of a generic full scale wind tunnel model to suppress the local <b>flow</b> <b>separations.</b> The AFC method is based on the principle of fluidic actuation and assembles a pulsed blowing with a 180 ° phase shift between the neighboring nozzles. Its working principle is the production of vortices that enhance the mixing of the boundary layer and the free stream flow. The free stream flow {{in the wake of the}} nacelle is compromised due to the wakes of local <b>flow</b> <b>separations</b> and longitudinal vortices such as the strake vortex. The computation results show that pulsed blowing is capable of suppressing the local separations. It is shown that a certain blowing velocity exists that is required for the suppression of the nacelle-wake separation. Additionally the influence of the pulse frequency was analyzed with a parameter study. It was shown that the local <b>flow</b> <b>separations</b> were suppressed by both low and high pulse frequencies...|$|R

25|$|To train F-102A pilots, the TF-102A trainer was developed, with 111 {{eventually}} manufactured. The {{aircraft was}} designed with side-by-side seating to facilitate pilot training, a popular concept in the 1950s (also {{used with the}} American Cessna T-37, British Hawker Hunter T.7 and English Electric Lightning T.4, among others). This required a redesign of the cockpit and nose incorporating a set of vortex generators {{on the top of}} the cockpit to prevent <b>flow</b> <b>separation</b> under certain circumstances, and repositioning of the intake ducts. Despite the many changes, the aircraft was combat-capable, although this variant was predictably slower, reaching only subsonic speeds in level flight.|$|E
25|$|Turbulence {{and high}} shear {{stresses}} are also major issues with MHV, {{as they can}} fracture the valve housing or components, or induce blood damage. A large flow gradient can lead to these factors, so <b>flow</b> <b>separation</b> and stagnation should be as small as possible. High stresses are created {{at the edges of}} the annular jet in caged-ball valves, in narrow regions {{at the edges of the}} major orifice jet in tilting-disc valves, and in regions immediately distal to the valve leaflets in bileaflet valves. The implications of blood damage from these stresses are discussed in the next section.|$|E

40|$|Strong {{interactions}} {{can occur}} between the flow about an aerospace vehicle and its structural components resulting in several important aeroelastic phenomena. These aeroelastic phenomena can significantly influence {{the performance of}} the vehicle. At present, closed-form solutions are available for aeroelastic computations when flows are in either the linear subsonic or supersonic range. However, for aeroelasticity involving complex nonlinear flows with shock waves, vortices, <b>flow</b> <b>separations,</b> and aerodynamic heating, computational methods are still under development. These complex aeroelastic interactions can be dangerous and limit the performance of aircraft. Examples of these detrimental effects are aircraft with highly swept wings experiencing vortex-induced aeroelastic oscillations, transonic regime at which the flutter speed is low, aerothermoelastic loads that {{play a critical role in}} the design of high-speed vehicles, and <b>flow</b> <b>separations</b> that often lead to buffeting with undesirable structural oscillations. The simulation of these complex aeroelastic phenomena requires an integrated analysis of fluids and structures.

Another is the flow within cyclone separators; the swirling flow there occurs in an annular region between two tubes.

Under certain conditions, the flow in the reversal region becomes unstable, resulting in a period rotating force on the outer tube.|$|E
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of <b>flow</b> <b>separation,</b> the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E
