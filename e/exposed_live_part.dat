50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of the knife}} switch are the slow opening speed and {{the proximity of the}} operator to <b>exposed</b> <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> Metal-enclosed safety disconnect switches are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of pre-1950 fuseboxes are still in service. These should be treated with caution because <b>exposed</b> <b>live</b> <b>parts</b> are common on these boxes. The {{installations}} they supply will not meet modern standards for electrical safety. Another characteristic of very old installations is {{that there may be}} two fuses for each circuit; one on the live and one on the neutral. In rare instances, old ring circuits may be encountered with no fewer than 4 15 A fuses per ring, one on each of L and N, and this duplicated for each of the two feeds for the ring.|$|R
50|$|In {{electronics}} {{testing and}} servicing an isolation transformer is a 1:1 (under load) power transformer used for safety. Without it, <b>exposed</b> <b>live</b> metal in a {{device under test}} is at a hazardous voltage relative to grounded objects such as a heating radiator or oscilloscope ground lead (a particular hazard with some old vacuum-tube equipment with live chassis). With the transformer, {{as there is no}} conductive connection between transformer secondary and earth, there is no danger in touching a <b>live</b> <b>part</b> of the circuit while another part of the body is earthed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Exposed</b> <b>live</b> grounds are dangerous. They are live, and can electrocute {{end users}} if touched. Headphone sockets fitted {{by end users}} to live chassis TVs are {{especially}} dangerous, as {{not only are they}} often live, but any electrical shock will pass through the user’s head. Sets that have both a headphone socket and a live chassis use an audio isolation transformer to make the arrangement safe.|$|R

50|$|The barehanded {{approach}} has a live line worker performing {{the work in}} direct electric contact with <b>live</b> <b>parts.</b> Before contact, the worker's body is raised to the same electric potential as the <b>live</b> <b>parts,</b> and then held there by electric connection, while maintaining suitable isolation from the surroundings which are at different potentials, like the ground, other people or trees.

50|$|Glycolic acid is used {{to improve}} the skin's {{appearance}} and texture. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the stratum corneum to be exfoliated, <b>exposing</b> <b>live</b> skin cells. Highly purified grades of glycolic acid are commercially available for personal care applications.|$|R
