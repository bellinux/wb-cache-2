25|$|The {{history of}} <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{dates back to}} the {{windmill}} and the waterwheel. People have searched for ways to store the energy from heat and vibrations for many decades. One driving force behind the search for new <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> devices is the desire to power sensor networks and mobile devices without batteries. <b>Energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> is also motivated by a desire {{to address the issue of}} climate change and global warming.|$|E

25|$|Current {{interest}} in low power <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> is for independent sensor networks. In these applications an <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> scheme puts power stored into a capacitor then boosted/regulated {{to a second}} storage capacitor or battery for the use in the microprocessor. The power is usually used in a sensor application and the data stored or is transmitted possibly through a wireless method.|$|E
30|$|If power {{increases}} upon an <b>energy</b> <b>harvest,</b> all <b>energy</b> {{available at}} the beginning of the former constant power band has been consumed by this <b>energy</b> <b>harvest.</b>|$|R

30|$|For {{the wind}} power density {{variation}} {{based on the}} Weibull analysis, January to June every year may be considered as the periods with good potential for wind <b>energy</b> <b>harvest.</b> However, the months of February and periods of May and July appeared to have better potential while June had the highest potential for wind <b>energy</b> <b>harvest.</b> The range of monthly wind power density lay between 410.8 and 1424.4 W/m 2.|$|R
25|$|The {{principles}} of <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> from ambient EMR {{can be demonstrated}} with basic components.|$|E
25|$|A similar idea {{is being}} {{researched}} by DARPA in the United States {{in a project}} called <b>Energy</b> <b>Harvesting,</b> which includes an attempt to power battlefield equipment by piezoelectric generators embedded in soldiers' boots. However, these <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> sources by association affect the body. DARPA's effort to harness 1–2watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes. Other <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> ideas include harvesting the energy from human movements in train stations or other public places and converting a dance floor to generate electricity. Vibrations from industrial machinery can also be harvested by piezoelectric materials to charge batteries for backup supplies or to power low-power microprocessors and wireless radios.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the piezoelectric effect, which is another type of ferroelectric behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
30|$|The problem {{considered}} {{in this paper}} is an offline[*]problem, where data arrival and <b>energy</b> <b>harvest</b> instants and amounts {{are assumed to be}} known in advance. Although this kind of prior information of data and energy arrivals may not be possible in all practical settings, analysis of the offline optimal solution nevertheless shed light on the nature of a good power/rate policy and boundaries on the best performance. Moreover, in many scenarios, <b>energy</b> <b>harvest</b> processes are predictable (e.g., solar <b>energy</b> <b>harvest</b> rate determined by daily and seasonal irradiation patterns), and data arrivals could also be deterministic depending on session or protocol requirements (e.g., periodic transmissions made by a sensor node). The offline assumption could be a good approximation in the case of predictable processes.|$|R

25|$|Supercapacitors are {{suitable}} temporary energy storage devices for <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems. In <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems the energy is {{collected from the}} ambient or renewable sources, e.g. mechanical movement, light or electromagnetic fields, and converted to electrical energy in an energy storage device. For example, it was demonstrated that energy collected from RF (radio frequency) fields (using an RF antenna as an appropriate rectifier circuit) can be stored to a printed supercapacitor. The harvested energy was then used to power an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) circuit for over 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the effect}} is {{actually}} wanted, for example to use LEDs as light-sensitive devices (see LED as light sensor) or even for <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting,</b> then sometimes called light-emitting and -absorbing diodes (LEADs).|$|E
25|$|Alternative thermal <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> devices {{include the}} thermogenerator. Thermogenerators allow less {{efficient}} conversion (5-10%) {{but may be}} useful in situations where the end product must be electricity, and where a small conversion device is a critical factor.|$|E

Industrial production of several prototype batches of solar windows has started in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Combinations of {{different}} types of energy harvesters can further reduce dependence on batteries, particularly in environments where the available ambient energy types change periodically. This type of complementary balanced <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> has the potential to increase reliability of wireless sensor systems for structural health monitoring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> devices {{converting}} ambient {{energy into}} electrical energy have attracted {{much interest in}} both the military and commercial sectors. Some systems convert motion, {{such as that of}} ocean waves, into electricity to be used by oceanographic monitoring sensors for autonomous operation. Future applications may include high power output devices (or arrays of such devices) deployed at remote locations to serve as reliable power stations for large systems. Another application is in wearable electronics, where <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> devices can power or recharge cellphones, mobile computers, radio communication equipment, etc. All of these devices must be sufficiently robust to endure long-term exposure to hostile environments and have a broad range of dynamic sensitivity to exploit the entire spectrum of wave motions.|$|E

Since we consider the self-interference link as useful link, thus from (16), the selected relay not only <b>harvests</b> <b>energy</b> from the source but it also scavenges energy from the self-interference link. Note that, we take into consideration particular case that the average energy used for transmission by the selected relay is equal to that being harvested [15]. Further, we ignore the negligible <b>energy</b> <b>harvested</b> from the receiver noise since the <b>energy</b> <b>harvested</b> from the source is much larger {{than that of the}} receiver noise [12].|$|R

30|$|The optimal {{solutions}} maximizing bare {{land value}} indicate that conventional forest management regimes remain optimal for sparse stands. <b>Energy</b> <b>harvests</b> occurred only when profitable, led to lower financial returns. A forest bioenergy policy which included compulsory <b>energy</b> wood <b>harvesting</b> was optimal for denser stands. At a higher interest rate (4  %), increasing energy wood price postponed <b>energy</b> wood <b>harvesting.</b> In addition, our {{results show that}} early thinning somewhat reduced wood quality for stands in fertile sites. For less fertile sites, the changes were insignificant.|$|R
25|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>{{harvesting}}</b> (also {{known as}} power harvesting or energy scavenging or ambient power) {{is the process}} by which energy is derived from external sources (e.g., solar power, thermal energy, wind energy, salinity gradients, and kinetic energy, also known as ambient energy), captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and wireless sensor networks.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{an attempt}} to bring nanofluidic {{technology}} into energy conversion. In this case, the electrical charged wall behaves as the stator, while the flowing solution as the rotor. It is observed that when the pressure-driven solvent flowing through a charged nanochannel, it can generate a streaming current and a streaming potential. This phenomenon {{can be used in}} electrical <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{produces a}} helium-4 nucleus (4He) and a high-energy proton. As with the p-11B aneutronic fusion fuel cycle, {{most of the}} reaction energy is released as charged particles, reducing activation of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> (via any of several speculative technologies). In practice, D-D side reactions produce {{a significant number of}} neutrons, resulting in p-11B being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.|$|E

30|$|As {{there is}} no data arrival {{at the time when}} power increases, the only {{possibility}} that power increases upon an <b>energy</b> <b>harvest</b> is condition (a) of Lemma 3.|$|R
25|$|PZT {{thin films}} have {{attracted}} attention for {{applications such as}} force sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes actuators, tunable optics, micro pumps, ferroelectric RAM, display systems and smart roads, when energy sources are limited, <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{plays an important role}} in the environment. Smart roads have the potential to play an important role in power generation. Embedding piezoelectric material in the road can convert pressure exerted by moving vehicles into voltage and current.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{locating}} {{high traffic}} areas {{is critical for}} optimization of the <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> efficiency, {{as well as the}} orientation of the tile pavement significantly affects the total amount of the harvested energy. A density flow evaluation is recommended to qualitatively evaluate the piezoelectric power harvesting potential of the considered area {{based on the number of}} pedestrian crossings per unit time. In X. Li's study, the potential application of a commercial piezoelectric energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the piezoelectric tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with piezoelectric tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1MWh/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building. In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is adequate and powers street lights, billboards and signs.|$|E
25|$|Tree {{metabolic}} <b>energy</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{is a type}} of bio-energy harvesting. Voltree {{has developed}} a method for harvesting energy from trees. These energy harvesters are being used to power remote sensors and mesh networks as the basis for a long term deployment system to monitor forest fires and weather in the forest. Their website says that the useful life of such a device should be limited only by the lifetime of the tree to which it is attached. They recently deployed a small test network in a US National Park forest.|$|E

Numerical analysis is taken toevaluate the <b>energy</b> <b>harvested</b> keeping the vibration optimized for the maximum interaction to the energy source using linear matrix inequalities for control driven. The dimensionless power output, actuation power and net output power is determined. As a result, {{it is possible to}} verify that the total <b>energy</b> <b>harvested</b> via exogenous vibration using the proposed controller is increased up to 65 times when in comparison to the open loop system...|$|R
