This article addresses the issue of medium term durability. A <b>five-year</b> follow-up was <b>undertaken</b> of a sample of 90 subjects who participated in a {{randomized controlled}} trial of CBT and befriending (BF). Patients received routine care throughout the trial and the follow-up period. Intention to treat multivariate analysis was performed by an independent statistician following multiple imputation of missing data. Fifty-nine out of ninety patients were followed up at 5 years (CBT = 31, BF = 28). In comparison to BF and usual treatment, CBT showed evidence of a significantly greater and more durable effect on overall symptom severity (NNT = 10. 36, CI ? 10. 21, 10. 51) and level of negative symptoms (NNT = 5. 22, CI ? 5. 06 ? 5. 37). No difference was found between CBT and BF on either overall symptoms of schizophrenia or depression. The initial cost of an adjunctive course of CBT for individuals with medication refractory schizophrenia may be justified in light of symptomatic benefits that persist over the medium term...|$|R

This <b>five-year</b> study was <b>undertaken</b> to determine the predictive efficacy of a kindergarten screening battery. The independent variables of this study were intelligence, visual-motor integration, short-term visual memory, short-term auditory memory, auditory discrimination, reading achievement, arithmetic achievement, word recognition and word reproduction. In order to investigate longitudinal validity, the kindergarten screening battery results were compared with a measure of school success (reading comprehension, Stanford Achievement Test) for grades one through five. The subjects were 245 students who attended kindergarten during the 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982 school years and were present for all the subtests of the kindergarten screening battery. In subsequent years (1979 through 1983), students were administered the reading comprehension subtest (SAT) in the spring of each year. These children attended two elementary schools in a suburban community close to Chicago. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the proportion of variance of the dependent variable (reading comprehension) that could be most efficiently accounted for by a linear combination of the independent variables (kindergarten screening battery and gender). Also a stepwise procedure was used to assess the contribution of each variable. The results indicated that, with the exception of gender, the nine subtests of the kindergarten screening battery were significantly correlated with the dependent variable, reading comprehension, in grades one, two, and three. The abbreviated batteries explained 26 percent to 46 percent of the variance of the dependent variable, and the total battery explained 34 percent to 51 percent of the variance of the dependent variable. The total battery explained 51 percent of the fifth grade reading comprehension variance. Implications of these results were examined in terms of predictive information on kindergarten children {{that could be used in}} the identification of children with reading problems. Suggestions for future research include several methodological considerations and additional research questions...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{wildlife}} problems associated with transport infrastructure development in Norway involve the negative effects on reindeer populations. Documented effects include barrier effects resulting in fragmented populations and indirect impacts on reindeer grazing caused by disturbance from road traffic and human activities in general. Wild reindeer are sensitive to disturbance and {{are known to have}} high alertness ageinstagainsttend to be extremely shy of human activities. The disturbance caused by road traffic and human activities can reduce the reindeer h habitat use at relatively ’s use of areas for large distances (several kilometreskilometers) on either side of roads. The result of this avoidance is a reduction in the available grazing resources, which during the winter consist mainly of lichens, in wide zones parallel to roads, and an equivalent increase in grazing pressure in a zone at some distance from roads in undisturbed areas. Because lichens needs 20 – 30 years to recover after periods of intensive grazing, the wild reindeer are regarded as especially vulnerable to barriers that reduce their possibilities to reach new grazing grounds. At the Hardangervidda, the biggest mountain plateau in Southern Norway, the functional use of the wild reindeer area has probably changed from being a large-scale rotation {{in the use of the}} food resources and calving areas, to a more restricted use of a smaller and central area. become an overexploitation of a too small area. The northern parts of the Hardangervidda isparts of the Hardangervidda are, for example, functionally parted from the rest by Highway (Hw) 7 and the railroad. This situation is not unique to the northern parts of Hardangervidda, but appears to be a general problem for most of the edges, and many of the surrounding of the plateauareas that also happens to be most affected by humans and less are no longer used by the reindeer. The Norwegian directorate for nature management has suggested closing down a stretch of about 40 km of Hw 7 crossing the Hardangervidda, during the winter months, hoping to. The aim is to resume reindeer habitat use in this partsthese parts of the areathe original use of the whole mountain plateau. Even if the road has very low traffic in the winter months (ADT 300 - 400), the suggestion has caused a lot of protests and discussions locally. In 2002 scientists from the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research (NINA) were engaged by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) in a <b>five-year</b> study to <b>undertake</b> research on patterns of reindeer habitat use and utilization of the lichen grazing resources and on the movements of wild reindeer in the aareas believed to be influenced by the road close to the road. The main purpose of the project is to find out to which degree the road and/or the traffic generated by the road constitute a barrier for the wild reindeer, and if it has a repelling effect on the animals. The NPRA will draw up its recommendation to the Parliament on the future management of the road based on the results of the project. The project has equipped a total of more than 20 animals with GPS transmitters, providing continuous detailed and accurate data on their habitat use and movementsposition. The GPS units are where programmed to register localize each animal every the localisation of the animal each third hour. The data are stored in the computer in the collar, which includes a possibility for remote data transfer, and the computer is programmed to deliver the data for the last two weeks every second week. The collar also sends out a VHF signal, so the animal can be tracked, and the data downloaded to a portable computer. Since the expressed effects in reindeer behaviourbehavior and habitat use are Because the fragmentation is the result of the cumulative effects of different disturbance sources, the project also aims to disentangle looks into the relative contribution level of disturbance to disturbance from other sources than road traffic, e. g.,xamples as such are pPower lines, the settlement of cottages and alpine resorts, and recreational use by skiers and snow scooters. all contribute to the disturbance of the wild reindeer. Maps of the distribution of different reindeer the food resources (e. g., lichens) have been produced both by using field surveys and by the use of satellite imagesphotos. When the preliminary GPS data are compared with the distribution of lichen resources, in the area, it is very appears that clear that the animals do not use the areas richest in lichens: oin the outskirtsfringe of the plateau and in a zone 5 – 7 km from the road. This zone of avoidance also strengthens the barrier effect of the road such that the migration routes to and from the North are more or less cut off. This is both a problem of reduced genetic flow, and the availability of winter grazing resources. The field work closes in 2005, and the results will be presented in 2006. The data will hopefully also also give us valuable information about the relative disturbance from other all the different disturbance factors, so that action can be taken based on the right factors. Future research should focus more on the relative and cumulative effects of different disturbance factors, and whether placing selected stretches of the road in tunnels can eliminate or reduce the negative effects on reindeerthe disturbance from the road.
