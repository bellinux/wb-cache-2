5000|$|In April 1942, the USAAF's Air Materiel Command part of ATSC (Air Technical Service Command) {{began the}} {{development}} of the Azon family (VB-1 and VB-2) guided bombs. Following on the VB-1 Azon bomb (azimuth-only), the Razons used two tandem annular wing assemblies, the aft assembly used for control. [...] "The Razon guidance kit had two octagonal shrouds in a tandem arrangement. The most problematic part in Razon development was to build a suitably modified bombsight, which would allow the bombardier to correctly judge the bomb's deviation in range so that the range control could be used effectively." [...] The <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> link used up to 47 preset channels. Around 3,000 Razons were built during 1945. Azon and Razon testing continued through mid-1946 in the Mojave Desert of California.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} {{is designed to}} the guidance of rocket-propelled missile with multiple object constraints. It allows the rocket-propelled missile to reach its target with a close to zero falling angle at a least time-of-flight (TOF). Instead of deriving the optimum guidance law {{by a series of}} linear quadratic optimization methods which results in guidance laws being complex, the new guidance law adopts a mixed framework composed of a modified PN <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> and a TOF <b>guidance</b> <b>command.</b> The modified PN guidance is designed based on measured state information including missile position, flight-path angle and acceleration, which yields zero-miss-distance and zero-falling-angle. The TOF <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> is determined in quadratic multinomial with respect to TOF error that is estimated with missile velocity reduction due to aerodynamic drag. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed guidance law performs favorably in multiple object constraints...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the derivation of homing guidance laws for interceptor missiles that makes use of linear-quadratic optimal control in a different manner than the traditional approaches. Instead of looking only for the minimization of the miss distance and the integral square of the <b>guidance</b> <b>command,</b> the new criterion penalizes also the "variability" of the <b>guidance</b> <b>command.</b> The solution has the familiar structure of traditional linear-quadratic guidance laws, of a zero-effort-miss term multiplied by a, possibly time-varying, gain. Still it differs in one essential feature: The navigation gain does not only depend on the time to go, but also on the total time of flight. The new guidance law also has an additional design parameter that can be profitably used to avoid acceleration saturation. © 2014 by the authors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new optimal {{guidance}} law that directly uses (instead of compensating for) gravity for accelerating missiles. The desired collision triangle that considers both gravity and the vehicle’s axial acceleration is analytically derived based on geometric conditions.

The significant contribution of the proposed guidance law lies in that it ensures zero final <b>guidance</b> <b>command</b> and enables energy saving with the aid of using gravity turn.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{an approach}} to provide precise, coordinated maneuver control during excursions from a hypersonic cruise flight path while observing the necessary flight condition constraints. The approach achieves specified <b>guidance</b> <b>commands</b> by resolving altitude and cross-range errors into a load factor and bank angle command through a coordinate transformation which acts as an interface between outer loop guidance controls and inner loop flight controls. This interface, {{referred to as a}} 'resolver', applies constraints on angle-of-attack and dynamic pressure perturbations while prioritizing altitude regulation over crossrange. An unpiloted test simulation, in which the resolver was used to drive inner-loop flight controls, produced time histories of responses to <b>guidance</b> <b>commands</b> at Mach numbers of 6, 10, 15, and 20.
