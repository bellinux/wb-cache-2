40|$|Introduction]: <b>The</b> {{emergence}} <b>of</b> {{sport psychology}} has influenced how athletes train and compete. Increasingly, coaches and athletes are incorporating mental {{as well as}} physical skills into their training programs and competition routines. Imagery is one such mental skill. To develop an imagery program tailored to the athlete three pieces of information are vital: <b>the</b> <b>imagery</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> athlete; <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>imagery</b> on performance; and the motive for using imagery. This paper explores measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagery</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> athlete. Specifically, the aim was to create new and valid measures <b>of</b> kinaesthetic <b>imagery</b> and examine the relationship these measures share with existing measures <b>of</b> <b>imagery...</b>|$|R

Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E

Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of The Witness. Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. The Witness incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with Blow on Braids art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of The Witness. Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives much credit to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been able to focus more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} at the Archbishop's Palace, Bordeaux, in the English principality of Aquitaine, on 6 January 1367. According to {{contemporary}} sources, three kings"the King of Castille, the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal"were present at his birth. This anecdote, {{and the fact that}} his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany, was later used in the religious <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wilton Diptych, where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child. His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir. The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The Commons in parliament genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, would usurp the throne. For this reason, the prince was quickly invested with the princedom of Wales and his father's other titles.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} print {{advertisements and}} branding materials to analyse {{the use and}} usefulness <b>of</b> <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial Other in historical and contemporary advertising and branding campaigns. At its core, the research seeks to delineate both the continuities and changes in what is termed the &lsquo;colonial racial script&rsquo; within advertising representations. <b>The</b> origins <b>of</b> that script are {{traced back to the}} 18 th century and key moments in its genealogical production are identified. The thesis poses the question as to whether <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> &lsquo;racial Other&rsquo; deployed in print advertising and branding campaigns has changed within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> contemporary globalisation and, if so, in what ways? Using a combination of critical media analysis that draws strongly upon semiotic interpretation and Foucauldian-inspired genealogical approach, the research interrogates a wide range of advertising data to examine the uses and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial Other. It offers a detailed analytical snapshot of an important dimension of everyday and popular culture in order to assess whether &ndash; as some have claimed &ndash; that the world has moved on to a &lsquo;colour-blind&rsquo; era where <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> &lsquo;race&rsquo; ceases its relevance or, conversely, whether racial politics continue to be a pervasive dimension of current advertising media representations. The research discovers that <b>the</b> strategic use <b>of</b> <b>imageries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial Other in a range of public interest and commercial campaigns confirm <b>the</b> currency <b>of</b> race as a commodity-sign in <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> globalisation and <b>the</b> value that the racial Other possesses continues to hold and in some instances grow. The thesis evidences this through its identification of a number of thematically organised types <b>of</b> reworking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing colonial notions and visions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial Other within global media culture. While, at a cursory level, <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial Other in the materials examined, which date from the 1980 s onward, does to some extent differ from earlier ads it does so more in terms of variation than outright change. The analysis reveals more similarities than differences in terms of colonial and existing racial representations. Significant residual traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial racial script are in evidence &ndash; <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> stereotypes continues and mutates through recycling and remodeling. At the same time, racial stereotypes being coded in contemporary advertising language are found to be more ﬂuid and vulnerable to manipulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that trauma memories are disjointed from other autobiographical material in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Assault survivors with (n = 25) and without PTSD (n = 49) completed an autobiographical memory retrieval task during script-driven <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> (a) <b>the</b> assault and (b) an unrelated negative event. When listening to a taped <b>imagery</b> script <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst moment <b>of</b> their assault, survivors with PTSD took longer to retrieve unrelated non-traumatic autobiographical information than those without PTSD, but not when listening to a taped script <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst moment <b>of</b> another negative life event. The groups also {{did not differ in}} general retrieval latencies, neither at baseline nor after the imagery tasks. The findings are in line with suggestions that traumatic memories are less integrated with other autobiographical information in trauma survivors with PTSD than in those without PTSD...|$|R
5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is a grain of truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The <b>imagery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E
