25|$|<b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{throw it}} away? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays {{often have a}} certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E

500|$|The Warriors saw Lin as a {{potential}} backup for Curry. Lacob said the team received more than one trade offer for Lin {{while he was in}} the D-League, but he was happy with Lin's progress as an undrafted free agent. [...] "He's a minimum, inexpensive asset. You need to look at him as a developing asset. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a superstar? No." [...] He finished his rookie NBA season averaging 2.6points on 38.9percent shooting in 29games.|$|E
6000|$|It was interesting--most interesting--and then Soames was so clever {{that they}} <b>were</b> sure <b>he</b> would do {{something}} with those pictures if anybody could; but what was his plan {{now that he had}} won his case; <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave London at once, and live in the country, or what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? ...|$|R
60|$|The old man grinned. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> deny his relationship--it was her look-out, not his. But neither <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let her rush him.|$|R
6000|$|His eyes sparkled; {{his color}} rose. He sprang to his feet, and {{unlocked}} the door. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? To {{start for the}} Continent, or to turn {{me out of the}} house? ...|$|R
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} volume of Walter Clark's Histories of the Several Regiments from North Carolina in the Great War, the author {{explains}} that the nickname came about when North Carolina troops held their ground during a battle in Virginia during the American Civil War while other supporting troops retreated. After the battle, supporting troops asked the victorious North Carolinians: [...] "Any more tar down in the Old North State, boys?" [...] and they replied: [...] "No, not a bit; old Jeff's bought it all up." [...] The supporting troops continued: [...] "Is that so? What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with it?" [...] The North Carolinian troops' response: [...] "He {{is going to put}} it on you'ns' heels to make you stick better in the next fight." ...|$|E
60|$|BLAYNE. <b>He</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He's</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{married in}} a few weeks. Markyn told me at the Judge's this evening. It's pukka.|$|R
6000|$|Was he {{referring}} <b>to</b> Eustace? And <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do what <b>he</b> {{would have}} done in my husband's place?--was <b>he</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell me the truth? ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh! <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{run away}} on family likenesses? Phoebe would {{not hear the}} 'and John;' and observed, 'Mr. Charlecote was his godfather, <b>was</b> <b>he</b> not?' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1985, Lim {{tried his}} hand at {{directing}} with David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, retitled Paradise Heights, for the Drama Festival. The Straits Times Rebecca Chua found that Lim's debut as director [...] "displayed some uncertainty". In the same year, Lim resigned from The Straits Times to set up TheatreWorks in February. TheatreWorks, the first adult professional theatre company in Singapore, was formed to [...] "promote theatre that is relevant to Singaporeans" [...] and create work for English-language actors. Lim served as the company's press and media relations consultant, in addition to acting in several of their plays. Lim also acted in the English-language versions of Kuo Pao Kun's influential plays The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole (1985) and No Parking on Odd Days (1986). Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. Nothing like this, which was 30 to 35 minutes long. And [...] spent {{at least a couple}} of weeks just talking to me. I was worried. Because I thought, when <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get down to it?" [...] In preparation, Kuo and Lim visited a coffin-maker and discussed the nature of funerals while Lim memorised the script.|$|E
6000|$|Sneer. What the plague, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pray? Puff. Yes; hush!--in great emergencies, there Is {{nothing like}} a prayer. [...] "Leic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! How <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> earn it--writing poetry? They don't {{pay much}} {{for that kind of}} writing, to my way of thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s Applejack Joe,” {{said the}} policeman, as he eyed the prisoner. “We warned {{him out of}} town this morning. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, steal a ride?” ...|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{he pushed}} her along before him, down stairs and through the passage, where a small oil-lamp was still flickering. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to her? She thought every moment <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dash her before him on the ground. But she gave no scream--she only trembled.|$|R
6000|$|Amyas rehearsed {{his story}} again, with pretty {{nearly the same}} exclamations, to which he gave pretty nearly the same answers; and then--"What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to you, then, sirrah?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's some job for {{a fellow}} just out of college to undertake," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do for a living?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> Marian?" [...] Laura whispered. [...] "Every fresh {{thing he}} does seems to terrify {{me about the}} future. Have you any suspicions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he? There {{are more}} words than one to that question. And pray <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> provide {{properly}} for his poor {{daughter in the}} West Indies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, and <b>is</b> <b>'e</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give us prayers afore breakfast {{like that}} fat-necked, white-faced old rascal what {{came down with}} us last summer and stole my boots?" [...] demanded the mate.|$|R
6000|$|He {{thought at}} first that he might perhaps {{overtake}} the Vervains before they sailed for America, but he remembered that they had left Venice six weeks before. It seemed impossible that he could wait, but when he landed in New York, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tormented in his impatience by a strange reluctance and hesitation. A fantastic light fell upon his plans; a sense of its wildness enfeebled his purpose. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? Had <b>he</b> come four thousand miles to tell Florida that Don Ippolito was dead? Or <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say, [...] "I have heard that you love me, but I don't believe it: is it true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{looked out}} across the sea, and he {{repeated}} her question <b>to</b> himself. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do in this great, strange land, whose ways were not his ways, and whose sympathies lay so far apart from his? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do about}} the tax on mixed biscuits?" [...] shouted Klaus von der Flue, who was a chimney-sweep {{of the town and}} loved mixed biscuits.|$|E
6000|$|Theodora caressingly {{drew her}} arm into hers, much pleased with her, and {{accepting}} her as entirely Martindale, {{and not at}} all Moss. 'What! <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be married in it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go get on dry clothes myself," [...] said Betty. [...] "I am nearly frozen. It {{is growing}} colder. I saw Jack come in. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Fort Pitt?" ...|$|E
60|$|He had a vague {{sense that}} he wasn't doing as he had proposed, but the chief thing was his sense of that {{uncontrolled}} fire within. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? There <b>was</b> the fire brigade station next door but one.|$|R
60|$|And now {{to grapple}} with it! Now to get it clear! What work <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? That settled, he would deal with his distractions readily enough. Until that <b>was</b> settled <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lax and exposed to every passing breeze of invitation.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} {{children}} had been sent down into the field he experienced the usual difficulty in commencing a talk with Tod. How far was his big brother within reach of mere unphilosophic statements; how far <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attend to facts? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you send}} him for me? I was just hanging round {{for him to}} go." [...] March sank into the chair at her side. [...] "Well, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s neither ’ere nor there," [...] ses the skip-per. [...] "The {{watchman}} {{has lost}} twenty-five quid belonging to one o’ my men. The question is, wot <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a coach for? There is no examination, is there? And {{if there}} was, I should {{think he could}} pass it. He {{has been in the}} sixth for the last year." ...|$|E
40|$|In his Budget {{speech on}} 26 November 1996, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a Santa Claus, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Scrooge. In this paper {{we examine the}} extent to which these claims are true by looking at the {{distributional}} impact of some of the personal tax changes, combined with some changes to social security benefits to be implemented from April 1997. ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{put himself}} into {{the power of his}} inferiors, and he knew it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> subjugate himself. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be ordered about by petty canaille of non-{{commissioned}} officers--and even commissioned officers. <b>He</b> who <b>was</b> born and bred free. Should he do it? ...|$|R
6000|$|He then {{resumed his}} {{exercise}} {{as if nothing}} had happened. The guilty boy was agitated and confused, and was utterly at a loss to know what to do. What could the teacher mean? Had he discovered the trick?--and if so what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? ...|$|R
