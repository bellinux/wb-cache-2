5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself <b>in</b> <b>dense</b> cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich <b>in</b> <b>dense</b> bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} the void {{environment}} affects the chemical evolution of {{galaxies in the}} universe by comparing the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of dwarf galaxies in voids with dwarf galaxies <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> regions. Using spectroscopic observations from SDSS DR 7, we estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of 993 void dwarf galaxies and 759 dwarf galaxies <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> regions. We use the Direct Te method for calculating the gas-phase chemical abundances in the dwarf galaxies because it is best suited for low metallicity, low mass (dwarf) galaxies. A substitute for the [OII] 3727 doublet is developed, permitting oxygen abundance estimates of SDSS dwarf galaxies at all redshifts with the Direct Te method. We find that void dwarf galaxies have slightly higher oxygen abundances than dwarf galaxies <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> environments. The opposite trend is seen in both the nitrogen abundance and N/O ratio: void dwarf galaxies have slightly lower nitrogen abundances and lower N/O ratios than dwarf galaxies <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> regions. Our mass-N/O relationship shows that the secondary production of nitrogen commences at a lower stellar mass in void dwarf galaxies than in dwarf galaxies <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> environments. The lower N/O ratios and smaller stellar mass for secondary nitrogen production seen in void dwarf galaxies may indicate both delayed star formation and a dependence of cosmic downsizing on the large-scale environment. The shift toward higher oxygen abundances in void dwarf galaxies might be evidence of larger ratios of dark matter halo mass to stellar mass in voids than <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> regions.

5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year.

The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} descriptive {{evidence about}} the distribution of wages and skills <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> and less <b>dense</b> employment areas <b>in</b> France.

There is also strong over-representation of workers with particularly high and low skills <b>in</b> <b>denser</b> areas. These features are consistent with patterns of migration including negative selection of migrants to less dense areas and positive selection towards denser areas. Nonetheless migration, even in the long run, accounts for little of the skill differences between denser and less dense areas. Finally, we find marked differences across age groups and some suggestions {{that much of the}} skill differences across areas can be explained by differences between occupational groups rather than within...|$|R
