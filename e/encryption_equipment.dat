5000|$|During World War II, Bayly was {{recruited}} by William Stephenson's British Security Coordination(BSC) {{to help with}} Stephenson's transatlantic communications from New York to Britain. He soon set up the telecommunications centre, code named Hydra, at Canada's secret intelligence installation, Camp X, near Whitby, Ontario. Bayly (often called Pat) was assistant director, with a British army rank of lieutenant colonel. Hydra sent and received Allied radio signals from around the world. <b>Encryption</b> using existing <b>equipment</b> was very slow, so Bayly invented a much faster solution for the purpose, an offline, one-time tape cipher machine labelled the Rockex or [...] "Telekrypton". A later version of the machine was used by British consulates and embassies until 1973.|$|R

50|$|The {{one-time}} tape systems {{used by the}} U.S. employed electromechanical mixers {{to combine}} bits from the message and the one-time tape. These mixers radiated considerable electromagnetic energy that could {{be picked up by}} an adversary at some distance from the <b>encryption</b> <b>equipment.</b> This effect, first noticed by Bell Labs during World War II, could allow interception and recovery of the plaintext of messages being transmitted, a vulnerability code-named Tempest.|$|E

The time chosen for this change was midnight, tactically the worst possible time because {{the greatest number of}} enemy contacts occurred from 2200 to 0200. Moreover, where several units shared the same keying device, having to move at night to change key settings was inconvenient and dangerous and added to the reasons for not using the equipment.

50|$|The KG-84A and KG-84C are {{encryption}} devices {{developed by the}} U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to ensure secure transmission of digital data. The KG-84C is a Dedicated Loop Encryption Device (DLED), and both devices are General-Purpose Telegraph <b>Encryption</b> <b>Equipment</b> (GPTEE). The KG-84A is primarily used for point-to-point encrypted communications via landline, microwave, and satellite systems. The KG-84C is {{an outgrowth of the}} U.S. Navy high frequency (HF) communications program and supports these needs. The KG-84A and KG-84C are devices that operate in simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex modes. The KG-84C contains all of the KG-84 and KG-84A modes, plus a variable update counter, improved HF performance, synchronous out-of-sync detection, asynchronous cipher text, plain text, bypass, and European TELEX protocol. The KG-84 (A/C) is certified to handle data at all levels of security. The KG-84 (A/C) is a Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI) and is unclassified when unkeyed. Keyed KG-84 equipment assumes the classification level equal to that of the keying material used.|$|E

On 3 March 1941, Mills-Roberts, in the No. 4 Commando Unit, launched a raid on the German-occupied Lofoten Islands. In the successful raid, the commandos destroyed {{a significant number of}} fish-oil factories, petrol dumps and 11 ships. They also seized <b>encryption</b> <b>equipment</b> and codebooks. In addition to the destruction of materials, the commandos captured 216 German troops, and 315 Norwegians chose to accompany the commandos back to Britain. In August 1942, Derek was involved in the disastrous Dieppe Raid. The raid, a small scale invasion mounted by Canadian infantry and British commandos against Adolf Hitler's Atlantic Wall, was a complete failure and the units involved suffered very heavily. Lovat and Mills-Roberts's involvement in the raid was to secure the opposing flanks of the landing area and to destroy coastal batteries. By October 1942, he was a lieutenant (temporary captain) (acting major).|$|E

There are several useful techniques that are available for encryping videos. However, one of the unique speciality for human eye is spotting the irregularity in videos due to weak video decoding or weak choice of video encryption hardware. Because of this situation, {{it is very important}} to select the right hardware or else our video transmissions may not be secured or our decoded video may be un-watchable. Every technique has advantages and disadvantages over other technical methods.   Line-cut and rotate video encryption method is maybe the best way of acquiring safe, secured and good quality encypted videos. In this method, every line in the video frame cuts and rotates from different points and these cut points are created from a random matrix. The advantage of this method is to supply a coherent video signal, gives an excellent amount of darkness, as well as good decode quality and stableness. On the other hand it’s disadvantages is to have complex timing control and needs specialized <b>encryption</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaIn many instances, {{the process}} of {{telemetering}} of scientific information {{must be accompanied by}} a voice conversation which either reveals the sequence of measurements or provides information as {{to the nature of the}} data gathered and/or transmitted. If such voice information can compromise the integrity of the telemetry data to an unauthorized interceptor, voice privacy equipment must be used along with the equipment used for transmission of the telemetry data. The recent developments in LSI technology provide a new capability to the design of voice <b>encryption</b> <b>equipment.</b> This is particularly true for the case where sophisticated analog encryption schemes must be employed to permit the encrypted voice information to be transmitted over the existing telephone and radio channels which are typically limited to a 3 KHz upper-frequency cutoff. This paper examines the recent developments in analog voice privacy equipment design, as indicated by the disclosures made in open literature by various manufacturers and evaluators of such equipment. Advances in the technology as well as in analytical definitions of analog voice privacy are discussed. The role of such valuable LSI chips as a microprocessor and the DES algorithm are examined. Also, in addition to considering the classic frequency/time domain permutation algorithms, developments in analog “pseudonoise” scrambling are examined in view of the data made recently available in open literature...|$|E
