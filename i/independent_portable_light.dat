5000|$|Aboard naval ships, battle {{lanterns}} {{may be used}} as emergency <b>portable</b> <b>lighting.</b> Installed {{in major}} compartments of the ship, a battle lantern can be detached from its mounting and used as <b>portable</b> <b>lighting</b> in the event primary lighting is out of service. Battle lanterns may use either incandescent or LED lamps, and may have either disposable primary or rechargeable batteries.|$|R
25|$|At the time, Owen Field did {{not have}} {{permanent}} artificial lighting sufficient for television broadcasts at night. This meant that untelevised home games had to start {{in the morning or}} early afternoon so as to be completed by dark, because the cost of leasing a set of <b>portable</b> <b>lights</b> was too high for a game that would not earn enough revenue to pay for those lights. For all televised games, <b>portable</b> <b>lights</b> on trucks were rented – but the leasing costs cut into the university's revenue, and often the four or five <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> trucks stayed on campus for weeks in anticipation of the next televised game. True night games were difficult to play in Norman because of the amount of <b>portable</b> <b>lighting</b> needed to illuminate the field adequately for spectators to see the players, much less the light required for television. Prior to 1982, the university knew which games would be televised and could plan months ahead for leasing the necessary lighting.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design and {{implementation}} of the <b>Portable</b> DC <b>Light</b> Bulb system for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s DC House Project. The DC <b>Portable</b> <b>Light</b> Bulb highlights the NiMH battery charging circuit, buck converter, and boost converter. The system is intended as a flashlight adaptor placed in between the dimmable DC light bulb and its screw base. The adaptor adds a portability feature to the DC light bulb to provide lighting wherever the user pleases. The <b>Portable</b> DC <b>Light</b> Bulb system is designed to operate with an input range of 24 V- 60 V and regulate an output voltage of 34 V for the DC light bulb. Computer simulations, calculations, and hardware results verifies the proposed <b>Portable</b> DC <b>Light</b> Bulb system’s design, function, and purpose...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of parasitic worm (helminth) infections requires specialized laboratory settings, but most affected individuals reside in locations {{without access to}} such facilities. We tested two portable microscopic devices for the {{diagnosis of}} helminth infections in a cross-sectional survey in rural Côte d'Ivoire. We examined 164 stool samples under a light microscope and then re-examined with a commercial <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> microscope and an experimental mobile phone microscope for the diagnosis of Schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths. Additionally, 180 filtered urine samples were examined by standard microscopy and compared with the <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> microscope for detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs. Conventional microscopy was considered the diagnostic reference standard. For S. mansoni, S. haematobium and Trichuris trichiura, the <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> microscope showed sensitivities of 84 · 8 %, 78 · 6 % and 81 · 5 %, respectively, and specificities of 85 · 7 %, 91 · 0 % and 93 · 0 %, respectively. For S. mansoni and T. trichiura, we found sensitivities for the mobile phone microscope of 68 · 2 % and 30 · 8 %, respectively, and specificities of 64 · 3 % and 71 · 0 %, respectively. We conclude that the <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> microscope has sufficient diagnostic yield for Schistosoma and T. trichiura infections, while the mobile phone microscope has only modest sensitivity in its current experimental set-up. Development of portable diagnostic technologies {{that can be used}} at point-of-sample collection will enhance diagnostic coverage in clinical and epidemiological setting...|$|R

50|$|The Sporting News {{disputes}} this claim, citing earlier professional examples {{going back}} to an 1896 game in which Honus Wagner played. It is, however, true that in 1930 Negro league teams, including the Independence Producers, were carrying <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> setups with them and playing night games on a regular basis.|$|R
50|$|HID lamps {{are used}} in {{high-performance}} bicycle headlamps, as well as flashlights and other <b>portable</b> <b>lights,</b> because they produce {{a great amount of}} light per unit of power. As the HID lights use less than half the power of an equivalent tungsten-halogen light, a significantly smaller and lighter-weight power supply can be used.|$|R
5000|$|The contest vs. the Hurricanes {{marked the}} first {{national}} television broadcast from Bryant-Denny Stadium. <b>Portable</b> <b>light</b> standards had to be brought in by ABC, since the Tuscaloosa stadium lacked permanent fixtures at the time.

50|$|Although {{the weapon}} did see some action in World War I, the BAR {{did not become}} {{standard}} issue in the U.S. Army until 1938, when it was issued to squads as a <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> machine gun. The BAR saw extensive service in both World War II and the Korean War and saw limited service in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Army began phasing out the BAR in the late 1950s, when {{it was intended to}} be replaced by a SAW variant of the M14, and was without a <b>portable</b> <b>light</b> machine gun until the introduction of the M60 machine gun in 1957. The M60, however, was really a GPMG, a general-purpose machine gun, and was used as a SAW only because the U.S. Army had no other tool for the job until the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the mid-1980s.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Kennedy, {{along with}} her partner, Violich, created a {{materials}} research division, known as MATx, in their firm. Kennedy {{is the director of}} design and applied research at MATx. The goal of MATx is to [...] "forge a new relationship with materials, on that will draw on mass customization." [...] MATx also explores ways that renewable resources can be used, and also how to incorporate bio-materials into architectural design. MATx's first project was used in Africa and was called [...] "Portable Light." [...] <b>Portable</b> <b>Light,</b> developed in 2005, is a lightweight, portable textile which can harvest electricity and each kit costs less than $16.
