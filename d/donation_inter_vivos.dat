60|$|Both in England {{and on the}} Continent a {{graduated}} property-tax (l’impôt progressif) {{has been}} advocated, on the avowed ground that the state should use the instrument of taxation {{as a means of}} mitigating the inequalities of wealth. I am as desirous as any one that means should be taken to diminish those inequalities, but not so as to relieve the prodigal {{at the expense of the}} prudent. To tax the larger incomes at a higher percentage than the smaller is to lay a tax on industry and economy; to impose a penalty on people for having worked harder and saved more than their neighbors. It is not the fortunes which are earned, but those which are unearned, that it is for the public good to place under limitation. With respect to the large fortunes acquired by gift or inheritance, the power of bequeathing is one of those privileges of property which are fit subjects for regulation on grounds of general expediency; and I have already suggested,(337) as the most eligible mode of restraining the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of those who have not earned them by exertion, a limitation of the amount which any one person should be permitted to acquire by gift, bequest, or inheritance. I conceive that inheritances and legacies, exceeding a certain amount, are highly proper subjects for taxation; and that the revenue from them should be as great as it can be made without giving rise to evasions, by <b>donation</b> <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> or concealment of property, such as it would be impossible adequately to check. The principle of graduation (as it is called), that is, of levying a larger percentage on a larger sum, though its application to general taxation would be in my opinion objectionable, seems to me both just and expedient as applied to legacy and inheritance duties.|$|E

50|$|A Donation, when {{referred}} to in canon law in the Roman Catholic Church, {{is defined as the}} gratuitous transfer to another of some right or thing. When it consists in placing {{in the hands of the}} donee some movable object it is known as a gift of hand (donum manuale, an offering or oblatio, an alms). Properly speaking, however, it is a voluntary contract, verbal or written, by which the donor expressly agrees to give, without consideration, something to the donee, and the latter in an equally express manner accepts the gift. In Roman law and in some modern codes this contract carries with it only the obligation of transferring the ownership of the thing in question; actual ownership is obtained only by the real traditio or handing over of the thing itself, or by the observation of certain juridically prescribed formalities. Such codes distinguish between conventional (or imperfect) and perfect donation, i.e. the actual transfer of the thing or right. In some countries the contract itself transfers ownership. A donation is called remunerative when inspired by a sentiment of gratitude for services rendered by the donee. Donations are also described as <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> if made while the donor yet lives, and causa mortis, when made in view or contemplation of death; the latter are valid only after the death of the donor and until then are at all times revocable. They much resemble testaments and codicils. They are, however, on the same footing as <b>donations</b> <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> once the donor has renounced his right to revoke. In the pursuit of its end the church needs material aid; it has the right therefore to acquire such aid by donation no less than by other means. In its quality of a perfect and independent society the Roman Catholic Church may also decide under what forms and on what conditions it will accept donations made to works of religion (donationes ad pias causas; English: donations toward pious causes); it pertains to the State to legislate for all other donations.|$|R

Posebna pozornost usmjerena je na nasljednopravna načela, i to ona koja su u svakodnevnoj primjeni izazivala najviše osporavanja. Riječ je o načelu obvezatnosti neposrednog sveopćeg sljedništva (univerzalne sukcesije) i načelu ravnopravnosti pravnih subjekata neovisno o spolu. Prihvaćanje odnosno izbjegavanje prihvaćanja tih načela prati se kroz spise hrvatsko-slavonskih ostavinskih sudova. Introduction of the General Civil Code {{marked a}} turning-point in the {{socio-economic}} and legal {{development of the}} Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. The initial reluctance to accept the GCC, {{due in part to}} the unconstitutional manner of its enactment, was soon overcome and its impact on Croatia’s legal life has been generally assessed as positive. Nevertheless, the GCC’s inheritance law regulations were subject to constant criticism, particularly its principles which contradicted the until-then established procedures surrounding inheritance. These were the principle of universal succession and the principle of equality of legal subjects, regardless of gender. These two principles formed a consolidated order in inheritance law for all persons and for all things. This meant that, in comparison to the previous feudal law, it did not distinguish between inheritance of movable or immovable property, nor did it matter whether the decedent left behind acquired or hereditary assets. Also, it did not matter whether the decedent was a woman or a man, nor did the gender of the heirs matter. The reluctance to accept these principles may be even more narrowly seen as unwillingness to accept women’s rights to inherit immovable property. The probate documents of the Croatian-Slavonian courts show the ways in which decedents avoided the women’s inheritance rights by resorting to various <b>donations</b> <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> and mortis causa, pointing to the conclusion that despite all of the expressed criticism, one may speak of the real-life adjustment to the system established by GCC...|$|R

However, these two models are unable to explain the strong tendency for estates to be divided equally across children, while <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers are made unequally. This paper presents a new framework for analyzing transfers from parents to children that is more consistent with observed behavior than are the altruistic and exchange models alone. In particular the model developed here allows for differing behavior with respect to <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers and bequests due to uncertainty about the recipient's permanent income. The empirical work uses data from the Health and Retirement Survey and the Asset and Health Dynamics Survey. The patterns observed in these data are consistent with earlier findings that <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers go disproportionately to less well-off children, while bequests are divided equally across children. Further, the results support the prediction of the model in that differences in <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers arise from differences in current income, while bequests are unequal when the children's permanent incomes are different. ...|$|R

40|$|Taxpayers are {{considerably}} interested in tax planning for intergenerational transfers (<b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gifts and bequests) that minimize {{the payment of}} taxes.

This paper aims to demonstrate that if the wealth management/investment behavior of the parent is taken into consideration, tax avoidance will persist even when gifts and bequests are jointly taxed.
