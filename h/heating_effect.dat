Though black carbon, most of which is soot, is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft).

5|$|The {{dynamical}} <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> of {{binary star}} systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E

A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E

A computationally less expensive 120 ° wall segment approach was utilized for the simulations in this study. <b>Heat</b> <b>effects</b> of the reactions were introduced by heat generation/consumption {{terms in the}} catalyst particles considering suitable reaction kinetics proposed in the literature. Due to strong diffusion limitations {{the activity of the}} catalyst particles is confined to a thin layer at the particle surface. Therefore, the energetic effects of the reactions were restricted to the outer 5 % of the particle dimension by a user-defined code. The selection of the correct active region was verified for both the particle external and internal–hole surfaces. Simulation results of the reaction <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to cold flow cases where there were no <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> but only tube wall heat transfer. Due to the endothermic nature of the reactions, relatively lower temperature fields were observed when the <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> were introduced, where the positions of the solid particles play an important role. The implications of introducing the detailed reaction <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> were emphasized in the development of suitable packed tube models...|$|R

Results show that the influence of wall heat loss on gas explosion strength is significant. In addition, the influences of wall <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> on explosion wave and flame propagation velocity in the gas explosion process are experimentally investigated in the adiabatic condition and heat conduction. It is found that the wall <b>heat</b> <b>effect</b> can affect gas explosion strength, flame propagation velocity, peak overpressure and the peak flame propagation velocity, and their influence degree becomes more significant with the increase of the adiabatic degree.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, through {{investigating}} {{a series of}} liquid, glassy, and crystalline samples with ultrafast multiple-mode 2 D IR and IR transient absorption methods, we demonstrated that the signal anisotropy of vibrational relaxation-induced <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> is determined by both relative molecular orientations and molecular rotations. If the relative molecular orientations are randomized or molecular rotations are fast compared to heat transfer, the signal anisotropy of <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> is zero. If the relative molecular orientations are anisotropic and the molecular rotations are slow, the signal anisotropy of <b>heat</b> <b>effects</b> can be nonzero, which {{is determined by the}} relative orientations of the energy source mode and the heat sensor mode within the same molecule and in different molecules. We also demonstrated that the correlation between the anisotropy value of heat signal and the relative molecular orientations can be quantitatively calculated. 1...|$|R
25|$|However, Joule's {{interest}} {{diverted from}} the narrow financial question {{to that of}} how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from {{another part of the}} equipment. This was a direct challenge to the caloric theory which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot's caloric theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> of a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, {{he noticed that}} microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E

When cirrus clouds are [...] thick, they reflect only around 9% of the incoming sunlight, but they prevent almost 50% of the outgoing infrared radiation from escaping, thus raising {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere beneath the clouds by an average of 10°C (18°F)—a process known as the greenhouse effect. Averaged worldwide, cloud formation results in a temperature loss of 5°C (9°F) at the earth's surface, mainly the result of stratocumulus clouds.|$|E

500|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. [...] The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. [...] In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. [...] Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. [...] It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent material for this purpose. [...] However, the absorbed microwaves have a <b>heating</b> <b>effect</b> and this can be severe enough to damage the absorbent material. [...] Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth.
