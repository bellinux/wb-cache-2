25|$|During Sucre's three-year rule, the {{government}} tried to solve its grave financial problems, which were aggravated {{by the lack of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>credit.</b> Sucre reformed the existing tax structure in an effort to finance public expenditures and tried to revive silver mining by attracting foreign capital and technology. In one of the most radical attacks on the church anywhere in Latin America, he confiscated church wealth in Bolivia and closed down many monasteries. The Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia never recovered the powerful role that it had held. Import duties and taxes on the internal movement of goods were also important sources of state revenue. In addition, Sucre reestablished tribute payments in an attempt to solve the country's financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} {{has been involved in}} a sustained war against objectionable <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> transactions. This war has caused the U. S. <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> regime to be riddled with complexity that spawns incoherent outcomes. The complexity contained in section 901 was created due to a legitimate concern: the threats posed by objectionable transactions that artificially generate excess <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credits</b> represent real policy problems. Since at least 1975, Congress and the Treasury Department have been convinced that the cross-crediting of excess <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credits</b> arising from “objectionable transactions” required a response in addition to simply relying on section 904. Thus, it is understandable that Congress and the Treasury Department would seek to redefine the <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> eligibility standards in response to transactions that generate <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credits</b> in objectionable ways. However, the historical record indicates that Congress and the Treasury Department ran roughshod over section 901 and used a scorched earth approach in their war against objectionable <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> transactions. The result is that the U. S. <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> regime is a “byzantine structure of staggering complexity. ” In the rush to enact reforms, ill-conceived provisions were enacted that should not have been enacted. Objectionable <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> transactions needed principled responses, and principled responses were enacted {{in the midst of a}} scattergun attack on these objectionable transactions. However, the United States must have a principled <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> regime that balances the need to prevent international double income taxation with the need to prevent abusive transactions. This Article addresses the disallowance provisions that have been added to section 901 as part of the government’s war against objectionable <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credit</b> transactions and assesses which of those provisions serve a continuing policy objective and which do not. This Article argues that U. S. tax law would be greatly improved if section 901 embodied a principled approach and if redundant provisions that create incoherent outcomes were removed...|$|R
25|$|As {{relations}} with the U.S. deteriorated, Perón made efforts to mitigate the misunderstandings, which was made easier after President Harry Truman replaced the hostile Braden with Ambassador George Messersmith. He negotiated the release of Argentine assets in the U.S. in exchange for preferential treatment for U.S. goods, followed by Argentine ratification of the Act of Chapultepec, a centerpiece of Truman's Latin America policy. He even proposed the enlistment of Argentine troops into the Korean War in 1950 under UN auspices (a move retracted {{in the face of}} public opposition). Perón was opposed to borrowing from <b>foreign</b> <b>credit</b> markets, preferring to float bonds domestically. He refused to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (precursor to the World Trade Organization) or the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
60|$|The note {{circulation}} of Germany is about ten times[146] {{what it was}} before the war. The value of the mark in terms of gold is about one-eighth of its former value. As world-prices in terms of gold are more than double what they were, it follows that mark-prices inside Germany ought to be from sixteen to twenty times their pre-war level {{if they are to be}} in adjustment and proper conformity with prices outside Germany.[147] But this is not the case. In spite of a very great rise in German prices, they probably do not yet average much more than five times their former level, so far as staple commodities are concerned; and it is impossible that they should rise further except with a simultaneous and not less violent adjustment of the level of money wages. The existing maladjustment hinders in two ways (apart from other obstacles) that revival of the import trade which is the essential preliminary of the economic reconstruction of the country. In the first place, imported commodities are beyond the purchasing power of the great mass of the population,[148] and the flood of imports which might have been expected to succeed the raising of the blockade was not in fact commercially possible.[149] In the second place, it is a hazardous enterprise for a merchant or a manufacturer to purchase with a <b>foreign</b> <b>credit</b> material for which, when he has imported it or manufactured it, he will receive mark currency of a quite uncertain and possibly unrealizable value. This latter obstacle to the revival of trade is one which easily escapes notice and deserves a little attention. It is impossible at the present time to say what the mark will be worth in terms of foreign currency three or six months or a year hence, and the exchange market can quote no reliable figure. It may be the case, therefore, that a German merchant, careful of his future credit and reputation, who is actually offered a short period credit in terms of sterling or dollars, may be reluctant and doubtful whether to accept it. He will owe sterling or dollars, but he will sell his product for marks, and his power, when the time comes, to turn these marks into the currency in which he has to repay his debt is entirely problematic. Business loses its genuine character and becomes no better than a speculation in the exchanges, the fluctuations in which entirely obliterate the normal profits of commerce.|$|E

We examine how two methods of limiting <b>foreign</b> tax <b>credits,</b> separate limitations based on type or source of income or an overall limitation aggregating across all foreign income, affect the optimal allocation of capital. We show that when investment opportunities exist in both low-tax and high-tax countries, a separate limitation method will always result in an inefficient allocation of capital. In some circumstances, an overall limitation can result in the optimal allocation of capital. In other cases, both limitation methods will result in an inefficient allocation of capital. In these cases either limitation method can be relatively more efficient. Simulations show that the potential differences in economic welfare under the alternative limitation methods can be significant. We consider the limitation methods in multiple settings, including the presence of pre-existing foreign income and allocation rules, such as interest allocation.
