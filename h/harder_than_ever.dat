25|$|Jim Clark won the 1963 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps in {{extremely}} wet, foggy and rainy conditions. After starting eighth {{on the grid}} Clark passed all of the cars in front of him, including early leader Graham Hill. About 17 laps into the race, with the rain coming down <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever,</b> Clark had not only lapped the entire field except for Bruce McLaren, but he was almost five minutes ahead of McLaren and his Cooper. This {{would be the first}} of seven victories for Clark and Team Lotus that year.|$|E
25|$|Hazlitt {{followed}} this by {{many years as}} a literary, art, and theatre critic, at which he enjoyed some success. He was subsequently beset by numerous personal problems, including a failed marriage, illness, insolvency, a disastrous love entanglement {{that led to a}} mental breakdown, and scurrilous attacks by political conservatives, many of them fueled by his indiscreet publication of Liber Amoris, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his love affair. English society was becoming increasingly prudish, the ensuing scandal effectively destroyed his reputation, and he found it <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> to earn a living. He married a second time. Consequently, more than ever in need of money, he was forced to churn out article after article for the periodical press.|$|E

500|$|The {{ground is}} located {{just over a}} mile from York railway station, which is {{approximately}} a 20-minute walk. The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station, and has direct services from Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and the South West. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult. The author Simon Inglis pointed out {{the irony of the}} club leaving Fulfordgate because of its location, when [...] "it is <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> for fans to drive in to Bootham Crescent". Parking on matchdays at nearby York Hospital is available. A park and ride facility operates in the city, and a number of lines drop off {{within walking distance of the}} ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Time {{acknowledged the}} critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while [...] "not all readers will agree that Dr. No... is magnificent writing,... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable {{book that is}} readable'." [...] In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning of Fleming's work, saying [...] "it's <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as [...] "true to form" [...] and [...] "a tirade" [...] as Boucher concluded his review by saying: [...] "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} {{the final}} of the Northern Ireland Trophy, which he lost 6–9 to Ding Junhui, he {{defeated}} semi–final opponent Dominic Dale 6–0, in only 53 minutes—a record for a best-of-11-frames match. O'Sullivan then reached the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix, but lost 1–5 against eventual champion Neil Robertson. In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into the sixth frame of the best-of-17 match. He had gone 0–4 down after a strong start from Hendry, before finally taking a frame back. At the beginning of the sixth frame, O'Sullivan opened with a break of 24, before leaving himself a difficult shot from black to red. After missing the red, he calmly shook the hand of both Hendry (saying to him that he had [...] "had enough of it, mate") and the match referee, Jan Verhaas, {{and walked out of the}} arena, stunning everyone present. The incident caused minor disruption to the other quarter-final match, between Graeme Dott and Steve Davis, being played simultaneously in the same arena. Dott later said that he initially thought that O'Sullivan and Hendry were having a fight when he heard an audience member shout [...] "Get a grip, Ronnie." [...] It was later officially confirmed that O'Sullivan had forfeited the match, which was awarded 9–1 to Hendry. O’Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising and saying that he would be [...] "back on his feet fighting stronger and <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> very soon." [...] On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined him a total of £20,800 over this incident, and docked 900 ranking points from him.|$|E

500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

On the podium he [...] "seemed to be dancing everything from a tarantella to a sabre dance". He suffered from a limp {{as a result of a}} childhood polio infection.|$|E

Skube commented that during the off-season, he had trained <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> before, and hoped to make the major league roster. However, he started the season at the Double-A level, with the El Paso Diablos. With El Paso, he batted [...]312 with 63 hits, 17 doubles, two triples, and six home runs in 56 games played. In late-June, Skube was promoted to the Triple-A Vancouver Canadians, where in 61 games he batted [...]267 with 56 hits, 13 doubles, four triples, and nine home runs. Between the two teams, Skube played first base and the outfield. The final season of Skube's pro-baseball playing career came in 1985.

2500|$|Flavors of Entanglement {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five. He said [...] "filled with songs of heartbreak, anger, and regret, {{along with a}} healthy dose of self affirmation -- or at least it seems that way, as Alanis' words are <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> to parse, a mangled web of garbled syntax, overheated metaphors, and mystifying verbal contortions all requiring too much effort to decode. In that sense, it's a lot like Jagged Little Pill, but musically this is far closer to the muddled mystic worldbeat of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, {{thanks in large part to}} her collaboration with Guy Sigsworth, best known for his productions with Björk and Madonna." [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+. She said [...] "Somehow, a devastating personal experience has galvanized her songwriting in a way that domestic bliss, as showcased on 2004's disappointing So-Called Chaos, could not." ...|$|E
2500|$|To make up {{for this}} disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever.</b> To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp {{administrator}} said in a meeting: [...] "There are cases when a prisoner is given only {{four or five hours}} out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity." [...] In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: [...] "By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead." [...] The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.|$|E
