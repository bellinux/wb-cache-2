5|$|However, a Portia takes a {{relatively}} {{long time to}} see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs and mantises, which a Portia often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E
50|$|Odd-clawed spiders {{have eight}} eyes {{arranged}} in {{two rows of}} four. The front row curves slightly backward, while the back row curves slightly forward. The anterior and posterior lateral (left and right) <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> clustered closely together, while the median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> spaced further from each other. In females, the anterior and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pairs, with a diameter of 0.35 mm. The anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest with a diameter of 0.23 mm. The posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> slightly smaller than the lateral eyes, at a diameter of 0.32 mm. In males, the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest pair, with a diameter of 0.29 mm. Their posterior median eyes and posterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> about the same size, with a diameter of 0.25 mm. As with the female, the anterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the smallest pair, with a diameter of only 0.15 mm. All of the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> white in color, except for the anterior median <b>eyes</b> which <b>are</b> black.|$|R
5000|$|Megabat <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> quite large, whereas microbat <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{comparatively}} smaller.|$|R
50|$|The non-{{dominant}} <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{covered and}} the dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> opened and kept open by a speculum, the corneal flap is lifted and the laser correction is done - an ultra thin flap {{can be created}} for treatment of very high prescriptions. The flap is replaced and the speculum is removed. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> treated next. The software data for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laser and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> usually under 30 seconds. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye.|$|R
5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and <b>eyes,</b> <b>is</b> exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E
5|$|The front (rostral) part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the {{zygomatic}} plates at the sides are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The head bears {{two pairs}} of antennae, {{the first of which}} is often biramous (branching into two parts) and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often {{flattened}} into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The mouthparts consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of mouthparts) and maxillae. Usually a pair of stalked compound <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> present, although in some taxa the eyes are unstalked, reduced or lost.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one eye affects {{the diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
50|$|Aprusia veddah is {{only known}} from the female of the species. The females are 18.5mm long. The {{cephalothorax}} is pale orange and broadly oval in shape. The anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the largest and circular, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> oval, as are the posterior lateral eyes; the posterior <b>eye</b> row <b>is</b> procurved from the front; the anterior lateral <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than their radius, the anterior lateral eye and the posterior lateral <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> separated by less than the anterior lateral eye's radius, the posterior median <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> touching, the posterior lateral eye and posterior median <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> touching. The sternum is longer than wide. They have three spines on the prolateral side of the first femur.|$|R
50|$|His right <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{blue and}} his left <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> green, a {{congenital}} condition known as heterochromia.|$|R
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{the front}} part (rostrum) is large, {{but not as}} long as in A.budini. The skull is more robust than in the very similar Akodon boliviensis, but less so than in A.simulator. The hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> {{narrower}} than in A.caenosus and not as squared as in A.polopi. Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative to the situation in A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the <b>eyes,</b> <b>is</b> to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye can see all of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, or up to 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the mandible (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{has only}} one female character, Miranda. Other women, such as Caliban's mother Sycorax, Miranda's mother and Alonso's {{daughter}} Claribel, are only mentioned. Because of the small role women play in the story in comparison to other Shakespeare plays, The Tempest has attracted much feminist criticism. Miranda is typically viewed as being completely deprived of freedom by her father. Her only duty in his <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> to remain chaste. Ann Thompson argues that Miranda, in a manner typical of women in a colonial atmosphere, has completely internalised the patriarchal order of things, thinking of herself as subordinate to her father.|$|E
5000|$|The Tiger <b>Eyes</b> <b>are</b> the [...] "visual ensemble" [...] of the Auburn University Marching Band. The Tiger <b>Eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of three distinct linesâ€”flags, majorettes, and dancersâ€”that feature complementary choreography. The three lines work for one common visual effect as one ensemble. Tiger <b>Eyes</b> <b>are</b> selected by individual auditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of a magic <b>eye</b> can <b>be</b> achieved with modern semiconductor circuitry and optoelectronic displays. The 100-volt-plus voltages required by magic <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> not present in modern devices, so the magic <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> now obsolete.|$|R
60|$|Now, as ever, he {{felt the}} <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> on the spy-hole. There sat the woman playing music. But her inward <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> on the spy-hole of her vital affairs--her {{domestic}} arrangements, her control of her household, guests and husband included. The other <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> left for the music, don't you know.|$|R
5|$|The {{relative}} position of <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the <b>eyes,</b> <b>is</b> relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the <b>eyes,</b> <b>is</b> narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>is</b> narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
50|$|These minions {{frequently}} wear {{a special}} magical gem called a hag eye. A hag <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{made from the}} real eye of a coven's previous victim. It appears to the casual observer {{to be no more}} than a low-value gem, but if viewed through a gem of True Seeing, a disembodied <b>eye</b> can <b>be</b> seen trapped in the hag eye's interior. This hidden <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> magically connected to the coven that created the hag eye. All three members of the coven can see whatever the hag <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> pointed at. Hag <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> usually placed on a medallion or brooch worn by one of the hag's polymorphed servants. Occasionally hag <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> given as gifts to unsuspecting victims whom the hags want to monitor.|$|R
