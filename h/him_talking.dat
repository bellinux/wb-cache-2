5|$|Under hypnosis, Scully {{recalls the}} Rebels burning her fellow abductees, {{as well as}} a Colonist {{spacecraft}} killing the Rebels and abducting Cassandra. During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues to insist that the events have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that they have already decided to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|One of Orton's first {{official}} WWF appearances was March 16, 2002 at WrestleMania X8's Fan Axxess, {{where he was}} defeated by Tommy Dreamer. Orton's first televised WWF match was a victory against Hardcore Holly on SmackDown! on April 25, 2002. Soon after, Orton became a fan favorite and {{was placed in a}} series of matches with Holly. In September 2002, Orton was drafted to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show. Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury, leaving him sidelined for months. While recovering, Orton still appeared on Raw in his own Randy News Network segment, a weekly vignette featuring <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about his condition. The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered villain.|$|E

25|$|The knives were {{reportedly}} purchased {{two days before}} the attack from a military supply shop in Fukui at about 12:40p.m. Katō spent about 20 minutes in the store, purchasing a telescopic baton and a pair of leather gloves while the store closed-circuit television captured <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> to and laughing with the salesman and demonstrating stabbing motions. Katō came to Akihabara a day before the attack to sell his personal computer and some software to raise money to rent the truck.|$|E
25|$|Unresponsive to Hartman's harsh discipline, Pyle is {{eventually}} assigned to Joker's squad. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing the recruits {{have failed to}} improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment {{for the rest of}} the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation for Pyle's failures, the platoon hazes him with a blanket party, restraining him in his bunk while beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels and used like blackjacks. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> to his M14 rifle.|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{to convince him}} to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided {{he was tired of}} broken promises and vowed not to see his son again until he was clean of drugs. The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the BBC Two Arena documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained {{in an interview with the}} BBC Radio 4 show Front Row that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.|$|E

25|$|After his {{fingerprints}} {{were found}} at the crime scene, Guede was extradited from Germany; he had said on the Internet that {{he knew he was}} a suspect and wanted to clear his name. Guede opted for a fast-track trial, held in closed session with no reporters present. He told the court that he had gone to Via della Pergola7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl they saw <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> to had long blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoe-print of Guede's {{at the scene of the}} crime was proof that Guede had broken in.|$|E
500|$|Tsamere's third show, Confidences sur pas mal de trucs plus ou moins confidentiels (Secrets about quite a {{few more}} or less {{confidential}} things), also written with Rollin and Joyet, was performed on tour throughout France from November 2014, and at Le Splendid from January 2015. Tsamere has said {{it is based on}} the principal that [...] "society laughs too much", and will involve <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Mark Snow, who {{got involved with}} The X-Files through his friendship with executive producer Goodwin. Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff {{as to whether they}} wanted him. One day, however, Snow's agent called <b>him,</b> <b>talking</b> about the [...] "pilot episode" [...] and hinting that he had got the job.|$|E

500|$|The encomiums {{were not}} {{confined}} to his batting gifts; nor did the criticism extend to his character. [...] "Australia has unearthed a champion," [...] raved former Australian Test great Clem Hill, [...] "self-taught, with natural ability. But most important of all, with his heart in the right place." [...] Selector Dick Jones weighed in with the observation that it was [...] "good to watch <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> to an old player, listening attentively to everything that is said and then replying with a modest 'thank you'." ...|$|E
500|$|Fellow musicians {{have also}} {{presented}} dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a [...] "plagiarist" [...] {{and his voice}} as [...] "fake" [...] in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times, {{despite the fact that}} Mitchell had toured with Dylan in the past, and both artists have covered each others songs. Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing <b>him.</b> <b>Talking</b> to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times, by saying that it was [...] "part of the tradition".|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman [...] was put {{in charge}} of the group {{responsible}} for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.|$|E

500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on the woman {{at the center of the}} charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E
500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Rintarō Okabe, the protagonist of Steins;Gate. Okabe is an {{eccentric}} individual, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often goes by the pseudonym [...] Mayuri and Daru call him , a portmanteau of his surname and given name. He {{is the founder of}} what he calls the [...] in Akihabara, where he spends most of his time, and has dubbed himself Lab Member No. 001 (as he is the first person to join). Okabe gives off the appearance of being delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the [...] "Organization" [...] that is after <b>him,</b> <b>talking</b> to himself on his phone, and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter. Most of the time he takes on a fairly arrogant personality. He is usually seen wearing a lab coat. As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he {{is the only one who}} possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs [...] "Reading Steiner". He is 18 years old and a first-year student at Tokyo Denki University.|$|E

500|$|... "Bad" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary music critics. Some critics {{noted that the}} song helped Jackson's image become more edgy during the Bad-era. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented that the track" [...] needs no [...] "defense" [...] and he generally praised Jackson's vocal performance in the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic listed [...] "Bad", along with two other songs from the album, as being top picks from the album's eleven tracks. In separate review of the song, Erlewine commented that Jackson's vocals [...] "sounded like [...] the love child of James Brown and Mavis Staples" [...] and added that [...] "musically speaking, in this case, 'Bad' is very good". He {{also noted that the}} track's [...] "authority and boasting helped to humanize" [...] Jackson and [...] "changed his image", remarking that it was [...] "fun hearing <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> trash and being his own bigger booster". Jennifer Clay of Yahoo Music noted that while Jackson's new edgier image was a [...] "little hard to swallow", the image worked musically on the album's songs [...] "Bad", [...] "Man in the Mirror", and [...] "Dirty Diana".|$|E

2500|$|Peel's funeral, on 12 November 2004, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was {{attended}} by over a thousand people, including many of the artists he had championed. Eulogies were read by his brother, Alan Ravenscroft, and DJ Paul Gambaccini. The service ended with clips of <b>him</b> <b>talking</b> about {{his life and his}} coffin was carried out to the accompaniment of his favourite song, The Undertones' [...] "Teenage Kicks". Peel had written that, apart from his name, all he wanted on his gravestone were the words, [...] "Teenage dreams, so hard to beat", from the lyrics of [...] "Teenage Kicks".
