5|$|The Whitman {{family had}} a {{difficult}} end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia, and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of tuberculosis compounded by alcoholism on December 3. That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum. Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at The Saturday Evening Post, had written to William Tod Otto, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, on Whitman's behalf. Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200. A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a furlough because of his poor health. By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship and published Drum-Taps.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the next}} drive, the Seahawks <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to score when Hillary muffed a punt and {{defensive}} back Melvin Jenkins recovered for Seattle on the Bengals 24-yard line. Two plays later, Krieg's 14-yard completion to fullback John L. Williams (Seattle's longest gain of the half) brought up first down and goal. But on the next play, defensive tackle Tim Krumrie stripped the ball from Williams and defensive end Jim Skow recovered it to keep the score 21–0 at halftime. The Bengals had dominated the first half, massively outgaining Seattle in rushing yards (167–0), total yards (241–49), first downs (16–3), and time of possession (20:35–9:25).|$|E
25|$|His Twenty20 {{exploits}} {{were not}} as successful, yet he landed an Indian Premier League contract with the Mumbai Indians. Despite not getting a game in the 2011 IPL, when he <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance in the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 in an injury ravaged Mumbai Indians side, he quickly grabbed it with a rapacious 45 off 21 balls versus South African franchise Cape Cobras with 3 fours and 5 sixes. He was then looking for another six but was caught by Owais Shah off a Robin Peterson delivery near the boundary. The Mumbai Indians amassed 176 thanks to another 58 by Kieron Pollard. The match eventually finished a no result due to rain.|$|E

25|$|In 1972 Home Farm {{and their}} trustees, Brendan Menton Sr. and Don Seery, <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to field a senior {{team in the}} League of Ireland when they merged with Drumcondra. Drums were £6,000 in debt and {{regularly}} propping up the league table. After almost 20 years in charge, Sam Prole sold the club to the junior team down the road. As {{part of the deal}} Home Farm also gained Tolka Park as home ground. Home Farm also agreed to keep the famous Drums name alive by playing under the name Home Farm Drumcondra but, after just a year, they infuriated the Prole family by reverting to the name Home Farm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, Seattle <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> scoring {{opportunity}} when Hawkins fumbled {{the ball on}} the first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they got from this was Krieg's third interception, this one to linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, but even {{this turned out to be}} insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, this one on the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.|$|E
25|$|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig then {{ordered them}} into the heavy {{fighting}} at Liévin and Hill65 in June and July 1917. After suffering low casualty rates, the Canadians were ordered {{to one of the}} costliest battles in the war, the Third Battle of Ypres. The Canadians suffered 16,000 dead and many more wounded, while 50th Battalion lost a quarter of their fighting men. The Canadian Corps was successful, however, capturing the village of Passchendaele. After the battle at Passchendaele, the Canadians <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> break and they had Christmas dinner at Château de la Haie. During the initial stages of the German Spring offensive that was launched in early 1918, the 50th Battalion, along with the other Canadian units, was out of the line conducting training and, as a result, missed the heaviest part of the fighting.|$|E

25|$|When they {{initially}} {{captured the}} bridge, the American engineers {{were not sure}} it could support {{the weight of the}} tanks, but they only had about 120 troops on the east side and they needed to reinforce them immediately. At about midnight the engineers opened the bridge to armor. At 12:15 am on 8 March, two platoons of nine Sherman tanks from Company A, 14th Tank Battalion, gingerly crept across the bridge in close formation following white tape left by the engineers outlining the holes. When they successfully reached the east bank, they moved into blocking positions to secure the bridgehead. Immediately behind the Shermans, an M10 Tank Destroyer from the 656th Tank Destroyer Battalion fell part way into the hole in the bridge deck left by the German demolition charge. The engineers briefly considered pushing the tank destroyer into the river, but decided they might further damage the bridge. They worked all night to jack the tank up and at 5:30 am <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> tank on the east side to come back and pull the tank destroyer across the hole.|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{spent months}} searching the Florida Everglades {{and came up}} empty-handed.

In early 1924, Baker <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lead on Ashley's location. Through his informants, Baker learned that Ashley was staying with family members in a moonshiner's cabin hidden in a swamp about 2 {{miles south of the}} Ashley family home. The short bushes and palmetto scrub made it very difficult, if not impossible, to approach the cabin, making it an ideal hideout. Baker was determined to capture Ashley and, with weapons from the Florida National Guard and deputized civilians, made plans to surround the cabin and starve him out. On January 10, 1924, he sent eight of his deputies to the house early in the morning; they were in position by dawn.|$|E

2500|$|After the war {{concluded}} the Navy found itself losing thousands of experienced officers and men to civilian life {{and did not}} have enough officers to fill its authorized billets. The Navy proposed to absorb the Coast Guard and its assets to solve this problem. [...] It was noted by the Navy's Bureau of Operations that there was no source to replace officers except the Naval Academy and the Coast Guard. Since the officers of the two services had worked well together during the war, the Navy saw the opportunity to solve their manpower problems by absorbing the Coast Guard and its personnel leaving to the Treasury Department only the vessels necessary for customs duties and enforcement of navigation laws. [...] Many Coast Guard officers supported the Navy's move to integrate the two services because they faced demotion from temporary ranks awarded by the Navy during the war as the Coast Guard returned to a normal operating tempo. On 14 December 1918 Representative Guy E. Campbell of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to permanently transfer the Coast Guard from the Treasury Department to the Navy Department. During hearings before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee in January 1919 two Coast Guard and two Navy officers testified in favor of the bill. Other testified about efficiencies gained by the transfer. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels was in favor of the transfer because he realized that it was the best opportunity for the Navy to absorb the Coast Guard while it was still operating {{as a part of the}} Navy and he testified for the passage of the bill. During a second round of hearings before the committee held in February 1919, Bertholf <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to testify. Bertholf's testimony before the committee systematically rebutted every argument of those in favor of the bill and helped persuade some members to hold the bill in committee. With the bill stalled in committee, Bertholf retired from the Coast Guard on 30 June 1919. The question of whether the Navy would absorb the Coast Guard was settled when President Wilson issued Executive Order 3160 on 28 August 1919, thereby transferring the Coast Guard back to the Treasury Department.|$|E
