5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{supposed}} that, despite {{his opposition to}} Enlightenment principles, Blake arrived at a linear aesthetic that {{was in many ways}} more similar to the Neoclassical engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics, with whom he is often classified. However, Blake's relationship with Flaxman seems to <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> distant after Blake's return from Felpham, and there are surviving letters between Flaxman and Hayley wherein Flaxman speaks ill of Blake's theories of art. Blake further criticized Flaxman's styles and theories of art in his responses to criticism made against his print of Chaucer's Caunterbury Pilgrims in 1810.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, an {{entrance}} is a procession {{during which the}} clergy enter into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors. The origin of these entrances {{goes back to the}} early church, when the liturgical books and sacred vessels were kept in special storage rooms for safe keeping and the procession was necessary to bring these objects into the church when needed. Over the centuries, these processions <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> elaborate, and nowadays are accompanied by incense, candles and liturgical fans. In the liturgical theology of the Orthodox Church, the angels are believed to enter with the clergy into the sanctuary, as evidenced by the prayers which accompany the various entrances.|$|E
25|$|Uranus has a {{relatively}} bland appearance, lacking broad colorful bands and large clouds prevalent on Jupiter and Saturn. No discrete features {{were observed in}} Uranus's atmosphere before 1986. The most conspicuous features on Uranus observed by Voyager 2 were the dark low latitude region between −40° and −20° and bright southern polar cap. The northern boundary of the cap was located at about −45° of latitude. The brightest zonal band was located {{near the edge of}} the cap at −50° to −45° and was then called a polar collar. The southern polar cap, which existed at the time of the solstice in 1986, faded away in 1990s. After the equinox in 2007, the southern polar collar started to fade away as well, while the northern polar collar located at 45° to 50° latitude (first appeared in 2007) <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous since then.|$|E

500|$|Francis {{expresses a}} resentment {{of all forms}} of authority, {{particularly}} during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: [...] "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman." [...] Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an [...] "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" [...] because commercial films had to [...] "answer to mass desires". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.|$|E

2500|$|MorphoBank is a web {{application}} for collaborative evolutionary research, specifically phylogenetic systematics or cladistics, on the phenotype. Historically, scientists {{conducting research on}} phylogenetic systematics have worked individually or in small groups employing traditional single-user software applications such as MacClade, Mesquite [...] and Nexus Data Editor. As the hypotheses under study <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> complex, large research teams have assembled to tackle the problem of discovering the Tree of Life for the estimated 4-100 million living species and the many thousands more extinct species known from fossils. Because the phenotype is fundamentally visual, and as phenotype-based phylogenetic studies have continued to increase in size it becomes important that observations be backed up by labeled images. Traditional desktop software applications currently in wide use do not provide robust support for team-based research or for image manipulation and storage. MorphoBank is a particularly important tool for the growing scientific field of phenomics.|$|E
2500|$|In North American {{universities}} and colleges, the tenure track {{has long been}} a defining feature of professorial employment, although it is less than universal. In North American universities, positions that carry tenure, or the opportunity to attain tenure, <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>more</b> slowly than non-tenure-track positions, leading to a large [...] "academic underclass". For example, most US universities currently supplement the work of tenured professors with the services of non-tenured adjunct professors, academics who teach classes for lower wages and fewer employment benefits under relatively short-term contracts. For those that are tenure track, it generally takes about seven years to earn tenure while working as an assistant professor. Tenure is determined by a combination of research, teaching, and service, with each factor weighted according to the values of a particular university, college or department. There is some evidence that professors that share more (e.g. via open access publications, open data, or open source hardware development) gain an advantage in obtaining tenure because they are cited more and can thus develop a higher h-index. This competition for limited resources could lead to ethically questionable behavior.|$|E
