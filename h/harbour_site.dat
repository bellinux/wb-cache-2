5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch <b>Harbour</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to English oak and silver birch amongst many other trees, and is of particular interest, {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance Survey map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{proposal}} to reintroduce trams (again, as in 1996, this would actually be a light rail system) to Glasgow. This came in light of similar proposals, completed in 2014, to reintroduce trams to Edinburgh. The City of Glasgow Council and SPT have commissioned a £500,000 study into the viability of such a system, which would initially operate from the city centre to the new Glasgow <b>Harbour</b> <b>site</b> then across the River Clyde to the Southern General Hospital and through Govan and along the south bank of the Clyde before crossing the river again back into the city centre. There are proposals to run trams further than this route out to the Braehead shopping centre and possibly Glasgow Airport; to Clydebank; and across {{the rest of the}} city.|$|E

40|$|In greater Lyttelton Harbour, {{significant}} differences {{occurred in the}} concentration of the nutrients between {{at least two of}} the seven sites in each year-long sampling period. For ammonia nitrogen, total organic nitrogen and total nitrogen there was no obvious pattern to the difference in concentration between sites while for nitrate-nitrite nitrogen, dissolved reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus there was a pattern to the difference in concentration between sites over all sampling periods. These patterns consisted of: • Generally higher concentrations of nitrate-nitrite nitrogen at the port entrance than at other sites • Generally higher concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus at inner <b>harbour</b> <b>sites</b> (Charteris Bay, Governors Bay and Corsair Bay) and the port entrance than at outer <b>harbour</b> <b>sites</b> (<b>Harbour</b> entrance, Purau and Ripapa). Within the port area there were generally higher concentrations of nitrate-nitrite nitrogen, total nitrogen, dissolved reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus at the Fox II mooring, between wharves 5 and 6 and between the fishing boats and the yachts than at the other sites.

40|$|Abstract. The layouts for {{the three}} {{proposed}} sites for the Saaremaa Island deep harbour were designed at Corson Consulting. The layouts were designed {{on the basis of}} geological, hydrometeorological, and wave and current conditions. Emphasis was given to the impact of the future harbour on nature. The layouts were used as the basis for wave and velocity field calculations using program MIKE 21. Wave and velocity characteristics were determined for wind directions that are significant for the <b>harbour</b> <b>sites.</b> SandCalc 2. 0 was applied for calculation of wave generated shear stresses {{on the bottom of the}} seabed around the <b>harbour</b> <b>sites</b> taking into account the local bed characteristics. The calculated shear stresses were used for the analysis of the sediment processes. The results indicate that Suuriku-Kuriku site is the most favourable <b>site</b> for the <b>harbour.</b> The proposed layout protects satisfactorily the harbour basin from most wind directions. The movement of the alluvial material into the harbour basin does not generate problems due to the characteristics of the seabed. Calculation shows that at Suuriku-Kuriku less dredging work is needed than at the other sites...|$|R

40|$|The liquid {{soil water}} {{contents}} in the seasonally thawed layer (active layer) were characterized from seven soil climate monitoring sites - four coastal sites from south to north (Minna Bluff, Scott Base, Marble Point and Granite <b>Harbour),</b> and inland <b>sites</b> from low to high altitude (Wright Valley, Victoria Valley and Mount Fleming). Mean water contents ranged from 0. 013 m³ m⁻³ {{near the surface}} at Victoria Valley to 0. 013 m³ m⁻³ near the ice-cemented layer at Granite <b>Harbour.</b> The coastal <b>sites</b> have greater soil water contents than the McMurdo Dry Valley and Mount Fleming sites, and moisture contents increase with depth in the active layer. The Wright Valley site receives very little infiltration from snowmelt, with none in most years. All other sites, except Mount Fleming, received between one and four wetting events per summer, and infiltrated water moved to greater depths (≈ 10 – 25 cm). The Scott Base and Granite <b>Harbour</b> <b>sites</b> are on sloping ground and receive a subsurface flow of water along the ice-cemented permafrost.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a first archaeological {{introduction to the}} study of Byzantine ports, harbours and other coastal installations in the region of Thessaly. Thessaly not only constitutes an ideal region to gain equal information for the Early- to the Late Byzantine periods, but also to compare independent regional and imperial central building activities. However, in particular Thessaly’s maritime connectivity has never been studied in detail before. As such, a first step into a terra incognita, the thesis is divided into two main sections: In order to conceptualize the study of <b>harbour</b> <b>sites,</b> the thesis first sets up a framework for the definition, understanding and interpretation of the physical features of harbours and their function and purpose. Taking into account influencing environmental conditions, such as natural, economic, social and political components, this helps to determine an accurate hierarchical model and to illustrate the interrelationship between different types and forms of <b>harbour</b> <b>sites.</b> Subsequently, comprehensive archaeological investigations around the island of Skiathos and other <b>harbour</b> <b>sites</b> in Thessaly, executed in 2012 and 2013, are set against this theoretical groundwork. In contrast to the common approach of regional studies, where a first general overview is followed by individual detailed case-studies, the opposite methodology is undertaken in order to achieve a systematic study of the Thessalian harbours and the complexity of their network system. Consequently, the collection of data starts from the analysis of a distinct area of a region and continues with the broader regional picture of primary ports, secondary harbours and staple markets. Functioning as an important junction of the Aegean shipping lanes and being involved in regional as well as supra-regional trade and port networks, focus is therefore primarily dedicated to the island of Skiathos. A joint survey project in cooperation with the Greek Ephorate for Underwater Antiquities (EEA), the 13 th Greek Ephorate for Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and the 7 th Greek Ephorate for Byzantine Antiquities was initiated by the author in 2012. A number of <b>sites,</b> including <b>harbour</b> installations and other coastal infrastructures, have been detected, documented and subsequently verified by geophysical prospections, using a Sub-bottom profiler and Side-Scan Sonar, in 2013. These have allowed to draw a clear historical picture of architectural developments, port networks and changes in the socio-economic connectivity of the area. Followed by a close investigation of further <b>harbour</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the entire region of Thessaly during two field seasons between 2012 and 2013, the detailed picture gained from the Skiathos survey project is brought to a wider context. This comparison finally allows an overall picture of the history and architectural developments of harbour structures and associated coastal sites, as well as general conclusions concerning the hierarchy and port network in the region during the Early to Late Byzantine periods. This has allowed a comprehensive understanding of the growth, use and decline of various ports, harbours and staple markets within Thessaly and has important repercussions for our understanding of wider social and economic changes that were occurring during these periods, such as the rise of the church as a powerful economic institution or the increasing activities of private entrepreneurs. In this way the submerged maritime heritage of Thessaly has provided a rich new resource with which to understand the cultural dynamics of the region as it emerged from its peripheral location to comprising major ports within the Roman maritime network and to stand out of the heart of the commercial route ways to and from Constantinople, as well as being part of the emergent networks of the western maritime states {{at the end of the}} period, such as Venice.
