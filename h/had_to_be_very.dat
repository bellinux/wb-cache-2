5|$|The {{problem with}} using heavy water {{was that it}} was scarce, and {{scientists}} could not readily acquire the quantities required by a reactor. At Columbia University in the United States, Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd attempted to use graphite as a moderator instead. This turned out to be possible, but the graphite <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> pure, as impurities, particularly boron, tended to absorb neutrons. On 2 December 1942, Fermi's team initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1. For the Manhattan Project, this was a crucial step towards the manufacture of plutonium in a reactor for use in an atomic bomb, but much larger reactors were required for mass production.|$|E

5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

25|$|A final consideration, {{especially}} for the Great Plains Project, {{was the use of}} methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel tankage, and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul liquified natural gas, using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) was an obvious choice. Methane burns much cleaner than jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place.|$|E
25|$|Prior to firing, the Nd:glass {{amplifiers}} {{are first}} pumped {{with a series}} of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them. Some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass, leading to a population inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission. This process is quite inefficient, and only about 1 to 1.5% of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser energy. In order to produce the sort of laser power required for Nova, the lamps <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> large, fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay. The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass, requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again. This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s U.S. nuclear {{submarines}} armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made {{this a good}} area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, {{the same year that}} the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. This guarantee was kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help {{in the development of the}} Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.|$|E

25|$|One notable {{aspect of}} the {{construction}} at El Tajin {{is the use of}} poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, pumice stones and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried. The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement. The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor. The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint. (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to enter on hot days.|$|E
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|E

500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up".

500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres.

Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng {{wanted the}} film to look [...] "grittier and less clean and glossy" [...] than other superhero films, and decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in {{post-production}} to keep texture in the images. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, opposed to Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. Exterior scenes in the film have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with [...] "unpredictable" [...] weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks, and [...] "just had to keep shooting, rain or shine, because once our permit expired on the bridge, we {{were never going to}} get it back." [...] Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep the look consistent. Production designer Sean Haworth also worked closely with Miller, who had specific ideas for the sets. The production <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> specific about which elements of each set were built physically to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI, and a gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with a lot of digital elements. That final sequence was filmed in a naval yard, and was dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.|$|E
