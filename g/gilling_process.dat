50|$|In general, combing is done {{to filter}} or sieve out any short length fibers (for example, fibers shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, {{followed}} by the <b>gilling</b> <b>process,</b> which removes hooks and involves three separate machines. Combing is then followed by two gillings to remove irregularity in the sliver and randomize fiber ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a sliver can be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibers with a suitable average length of 150 mm.|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} {{strategies are}} widespread in caudate amphibians.

The prevalence of fire salamanders in Southern Larzac was very low (pond occupancy: 0. 36 %). The observed abundance of fire salamander larvae and paedomorphic newts was also low in the studied pond. On one hand, the rarity of this coexistence pattern may suggest that habitat characteristics may not be optimal or that competition or predation processes might be operating.

The free amine groups present on the surface of chitosan aid in the chemisorption of the metal ions and subsequently result in their removal from wastewater (Kaveeshwar et al. 2018).

30|$|In today’s world, {{alarming}} {{water pollution}} {{has become a}} major threat to the environment and has {{led to the development of}} new technologies to minimize the potential contaminants from the water bodies. Effluents from the mining industries, power generating industries, electronic industries and tanneries contain large amounts of heavy metals that pose a great risk to the surviving population in and around the water bodies (Liu et al. 2012) and cause bioaccumulation in beings that ingest these waters directly or indirectly (Yousafzai et al. 2017). Heavy metals such as uranium, mercury, chromium, arsenic, lanthanum, lead, cadmium and zinc are few of the commonly found metals that contaminate the water bodies (Boddu et al. 2003; Tchounwou et al. 2012). Chromium (Cr, Z[*]=[*] 24, A[*]=[*] 51.9961  u[*]±[*] 0.0006  u) is said to be relatively stable among the heavy metal ions of the periodic table and exists in several ionic forms. It is toxic and it is considered to be one of the major carcinogens as well as a mutagenic compound (Geng et al. 2009; Dayan and Paine 2001; Aitio et al. 1988). Thus, removal of this hazardous heavy metal {{has become a major}} goal and research interest among several researchers and led to the development of diverse methods. Although several methods have been devised, bio-sorption using bio-based particles/nanoparticles has been considered highly efficient (Lasheen et al. 2013; Sheet et al. 2014; Abdel-Raouf and Abdul-Raheim 2017; Mane et al. 2011; Ahluwalia and Goyal 2007) due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles compared to the bulk materials (Rajput et al. 2016). Using SPIONs is the better option, since superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) obey to external magnetic field; thus, it is easier to remove after the adsorption <b>process</b> (<b>Gill</b> et al. 2017) and also it is low toxic and non-reactive to human and majorly it has very strong adsorption capacity (Lasheen et al. 2013). Further, crystallinity, dispersion, size and shape also play an important role in the removal of heavy metals efficiently. One of the major challenges of aggregation faced by SPIONs can be overcome by surface modification or by following up certain parameters (coating a sorbent material) that result in the formation of monodispersed SPIONs (Justin et al. 2018; Mahmoudi et al. 2011).|$|R

Measurements of gill and labial palp areas were conducted in March, June and October 2011. Annual mean concentrations of estimated chlorophyll a were significantly different between the two sites and were 1. 38 mg/m 3 and 1. 60 mg/m 3 at the control and upwelling site respectively. The annual suspended particulate matter (SPM) was 2. 5 g/m 3 (control) and 3. 3 g/m 3 (upwelling), and was not significantly different between sites. Gill and labial palp areas (mm 2) were closely and positively related to shell length (mm) and dry flesh weight (g), but there were no clear difference in these areas between the sites. There was a significant difference in gill-to-palp (GA: PA) ratio between the two sites in October, where GA: PA increased with shell length at the upwelling site, and decreased at the control site. Changes in GA: PA ratio was probably related to labial palp area variations which may have been influenced by the significant difference in chlorophyll a concentration during the year. Further it was found that measures of gill areas was significantly higher for frozen opposed to live tissue, and mussels sampled in March and June (frozen) could not be compared to mussels sampled in October (live). The measuring of gill area was more accurate compared to labial palp area, but both areas were measured with a standard deviation less than 10 % the reference value. A regression of gill area (GA) against dry flesh weight (W) in the form GA=a Wb provided smaller b-value at the control site compared to other studies, while the a-value was more similar. The results indicate differences in GA: PA ratio within the same fjord at small differences in chlorophyll a, while differences in gill and labial palp area probably need larger differences in seston concentration to see significant difference similar to what have been found in other studies...|$|R

A clinical study involving stable cirrhotic patients with and without overt hepatic encephalopathy was designed. A control group of healthy volunteers was used. Plasma from those patients was analysed using 1 H - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used the Carr Purcell Meiboom <b>Gill</b> sequence to <b>process</b> the sample spectra at ambient probe temperature. We used a gated secondary irradiation field for water signal suppression. Samples were calibrated and referenced using the sodium trimethyl silyl propionate peak at 0. 00 ppm. For each sample 128 transients (FID's) were acquired into 32 K complex data points over a spectral width of 6 KHz. 30 degree pulses were applied with an acquisition time of 4. 0 s {{in order to}} achieve better resolution, followed by a recovery delay of 12 s, to allow for complete relaxation and recovery of the magnetisation. A metabolic profile was created for stable cirrhotic patients without signs of overt hepatic encephalopathy and encephalopathic patients as well as healthy controls. Stepwise discriminant analysis was then used and discriminant factors were created to differentiate between the three groups. Eighteen stabled cirrhotic patients, eighteen patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy and seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly impaired ketone body metabolism, urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis. This was demonstrated by higher concentrations of acetoacetate (0. 23 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 05 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01), and b-hydroxybutarate (0. 58 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 08 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01), lower concentrations of glutamine (0. 44 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 63 ± 0. 03, P < 0. 05), histidine (0. 16 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 36 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 01) and arginine (0. 08 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 14 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 03) and higher concentrations of glutamate (1. 36 ± 0. 25 vs 0. 58 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 01), lactate (1. 53 ± 0. 11 vs 0. 42 ± 0. 05, P < 0. 01), pyruvate (0. 11 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 03 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01) threonine (0. 39 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 08 ± 0. 01, P < 0. 01) and aspartate (0. 37 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 03 ± 0. 01). A five metabolite signature by stepwise discriminant analysis could separate between controls and cirrhotic patients with an accuracy of 98 %. In patients with encephalopathy we observed further derangement of ketone body metabolism, impaired production of glycerol and myoinositol, reversal of Fischer's ratio and impaired glutamine production as demonstrated by lower b-hydroxybutyrate (0. 58 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 16 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 0002), higher acetoacetate (0. 23 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 41 ± 0. 16, P < 0. 05), leucine (0. 33 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 49 ± 0. 05, P < 0. 005) and isoleucine (0. 12 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 27 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 0004) and lower glutamine (0. 44 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 36 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 013), glycerol (0. 53 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 19 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 000) and myoinositol (0. 36 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 010) concentrations.
