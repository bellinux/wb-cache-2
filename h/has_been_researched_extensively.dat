40|$|Locus {{of control}} (LOC) is a {{fundamental}} construct of individual psychology and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>researched</b> <b>extensively.</b> However, the clinical application of the LOC construct to couple’s therapy {{has not yet been}} examined. A review of the literature fails to provide clinicians with adequate direction regarding how to engage with LOC in couple’s therapy. The authors present an informal and collaborative way in which LOC might be assessed in couple’s therapy: an LOC-focused genogram. Possible uses and benefits of the LOC-focused genogram along with a case example are provided. Keywords locus of control, couple therapy, genogram, ethical considerations The term locus of control (LOC) is a construct foundational to Julian Rotter’s social learning theory, proposed in 1954. Locus is from the Latin meaning location; LOC thus refers to a person’s orientation toward the question ‘‘Who or what controls life’s events?’ ’ It is difficult to imagine a more foundational question to the task of living and problem solving. And yet, although the LOC construct itself <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>researched</b> <b>extensively</b> (Rotter, 1990), its clinical implications have not, especially in terms of systemic therapy.
