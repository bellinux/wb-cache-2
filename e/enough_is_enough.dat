"Lady Love {{is more of}} a mid-tempo R album than {{a hip-hop}} hybrid" [...] that is [...] "directed toward the pop market" [...] and thus is [...] "heavier on gleaming synthesizers and in-your-face production."

While on the [...] "densely layered" [...] "Good To Me" [...] which has been described as [...] "serious and sexy at the same time" [...] and likened to some of the material on Usher's Confessions album, LeToya names and describes the qualities she wants in her ideal man, emphasising that he must be [...] "good to [...] ".
