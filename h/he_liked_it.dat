25|$|According to guitarist Paul Leary, he {{acquired}} the eventual cover image by chance while purchasing marijuana from an acquaintance in San Antonio, Texas. The image's photographer {{was at the}} acquaintance's residence for the same reason, and happened to have his portfolio with him. After a session of beer drinking and impromptu guitar playing, Leary accidentally caused some of the photographer's photos to fall on the floor. One of these pictures was a group shot depicting the young girl seen on Cream Corns cover, but surrounded by six older models. Leary commented that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> the photographer gave him the photo and its reproduction rights, and the girl's picture was cropped, blown up, and used on the EP's U.S. cover.|$|E

25|$|Brighton's {{transformation}} from fishing village to high-class, fashionable spa town and resort {{happened in the}} second half of the 18th century and was prompted by several factors. Sea-bathing and drinking seawater became an upper-class fad, encouraged by the publication in 1750 of local doctor Richard Russell's book on the subject. The good climate—sunny, mild and breezy—also became widely known when Brighton's first guidebook was published by Anthony Relhan in 1761. Road improvements encouraged visitors from London and elsewhere: the road from London to Brighton, notorious for its poor (sometimes impassable) condition, was turnpiked throughout its length in 1770. The arrival of royalty and the effects of their patronage then gave the town such prestige that it became Britain's largest and most important seaside resort. The Duke of Cumberland lived in the town from 1779; the Prince of Wales first visited him in 1783 (although he may also have come in search of Brighton's reputed health benefits); and <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> so much that he came back every year and eventually took up residence at the Royal Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Geoff Johns {{announced}} that Lex Luthor and Captain Cold would be joining the Justice League. In {{the wake of}} the Crime Syndicate's invasion, public opinion of Lex Luthor was incredibly favorable, and he decided that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> Another reason was he believed the entity that destroyed the Earth from the alternate universe which the Crime Syndicate came from was the larger threat and might eventually become a threat to their universe and wanted the Justice League to be prepared for that possibility beforehand. In an effort to continue being regarded as a hero, he tried to convince the Justice League to recruit him, but was initially unsuccessful. The Justice League eventually talked about how Luthor was going to keep on his crusade with or without the help of the Justice League. They let Luthor join the Justice League knowing he could find out information that could put all of them in danger, but Batman figured at least they could keep a close watch on Luthor and LexCorp, and much to the chagrin of Superman, Luthor secured a place in the Justice League, even building a new Watchtower for them and recruiting Shazam onto the team.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining his Teacher's Certificate {{from the}} Prince of Wales’ College at Achimota in 1930, Nkrumah {{was given a}} {{teaching}} post at the Roman Catholic primary school in Elmina in 1931, and after a year there, was made headmaster of the school at Axim. In Axim, he started {{to get involved in}} politics and founded the Nzima Literary Society. In 1933, he was appointed a teacher at the Catholic seminary at Amissa. Although the life there was strict, <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> and considered becoming a Jesuit. Nkrumah had heard journalist and future Nigerian president Nnamdi Azikiwe speak while a student at Achimota; the two men met and Azikiwe's influence increased Nkrumah's interest in black nationalism. The young teacher decided to further his education. Azikiwe had attended Lincoln College, a historically black college in Chester County, Pennsylvania, west of Philadelphia, and he advised Nkrumah to enroll there. Nkrumah, who had failed the entrance examination for London University, gained funds for the trip and his education from relatives. He traveled by way of Britain, where he learned, to his outrage, of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, one of the few independent African nations. He arrived in the United States, in October 1935.|$|E

500|$|The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Los Angeles-based Smog Design, following a concept sent by Roth. Smog co-owner John Heiden picked the image, featuring a New York Central Railroad J-3A Dreyfuss Hudson [...] steam locomotive, photographed by Robert Yarnall Richie, from the Southern Methodist University's photo library, stating he chose it because [...] "Richie's angle on the photo makes it look like the locomotive is in motion and coming off the page". Aside from the reversed angle of the train, the artwork is shares similarities to the 1975 Commodores album Movin' On. The booklet includes Roth's hand-written lyrics for the songs. Regarding the title, Eddie stated that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> because [...] "there's always their reality of what other people think, and there's just the different kind of truth, which is the real truth." ...|$|E

Club graded it an A-, saying it was a [...] "funny outing" [...] that allowed Smith to show comic depth as the Doctor, as well as praising the guest stars. Though he referred to the alien up the stairs as a [...] "pretty standard-issue", <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> for being a metaphor of [...] "the trap of complacency and the ways staying in a rut can lead to safety, stagnancy, and ignorance of the peril encroaching just outside one's four walls".|$|E

500|$|Koshiro's track, [...] "Wrath of the Reset Bomb", {{used the}} motif {{associated}} with Viridi, {{which would be}} reused in multiple tracks.

A track that went through multiple redrafts was [...] "Aurum Island", the theme associated with the titular alien invaders: while every attempt made to create a theme ended up as a [...] "techno-pop song", the tune underwent multiple adjustments so it would not clash {{with the rest of the}} soundtrack while retaining its form.

Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it.

500|$|In a 2012 {{meeting with}} Bhansali, Kumar {{told him about}} the film; he {{explained}} that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to hear the story and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> and immediately agreed to produce the film. However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience. This concern evaporated after the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Kom won a bronze medal. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements. After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Bhansali revealed that the story of the film was so inspiring, it touched his heart and described the film as [...] "a rare experiment".

500|$|Spector {{described}} {{the team as}} interested in multiple genres of gaming, consisting of both maximalists who wanted to [...] "do everything" [...] and minimalists who wanted to do few things well. Close friends who understood the team's intents were invited to test the game and give feedback. The wide range of input led to debates {{in the office and}} changes in the game. In his postmortem, Spector concluded that the team was [...] "unrealistic, blinded by promises of complete creative freedom" [...] and by [...] "assurances" [...] of budget, marketing, and no time restraints, which he called [...] "seductive traps". By mid-1998, the game's title had become Deus Ex, from the Latin literary device deus ex machina ("god from the machine") whereby an impossible plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention. Spector acknowledged its grammatical faults as a title and added that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> because of the in-game struggle for power, the reference to the medium's own plot difficulties, the reference to the game inside a computer machine, and the [...] "self-referential" [...] acceptance of trying one's best to resolve affairs.

500|$|The PC and Xbox One {{releases}} of Fragments of Him received [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, {{according to the}} review aggregator site Metacritic. On Steam, the game varies between 80% and 90% positive reviews. Reviewers said {{that because of the}} graphics, as well as the slow pace of the game, it was obviously created for casual gamers. Bob Richardson of the website RPGFan said that it might not be for everyone, and would appeal to those who like relaxing video games. He said that the design of the graphics might be too minimalistic for today, although <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> and thought that it worked well with the game. He said that it was worth trying out and that the time the creators had put into making the game was obvious. Jose Rodriguez of the website IGN praised the [...] "deep and realistic" [...] story and said that the game gave priority to the narrative, and that it will appeal to casual gamers because of its realism and leisurely gameplay. Rodriguez criticised the duration of the game saying, that it is quite short for its price. Andrea Maderna, also from IGN, said that the game was not suited for everybody, but that those who appreciate games based on interactive storytelling should try playing it.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} of Henson's characters' final {{appearances}} on SNL, he began developing two projects featuring the Muppets: a Broadway show and a weekly television series. In 1976, the series was initially rejected by the American networks who believed that Muppets would appeal to only a child audience. Then Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where The Muppet Show began taping. The Muppet Show featured Kermit as host, {{and a variety of}} other memorable characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, along with other characters such as Animal. Kermit's role on The Muppet Show was often compared by his co-workers to Henson's role in Muppet Productions: a shy, gentle boss with [...] "A whim of steel" [...] who [...] " [...] things as firmly as it is possible to run an explosion in a mattress factory." [...] Caroll Spinney, the puppet performer of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, remembered that Henson [...] "would never say he didn't like something. He would just go 'Hmm.' That was famous.

[...] " [...] Henson himself recognized Kermit as an alter-ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character, [...] "He can say things I hold back." ...|$|E
