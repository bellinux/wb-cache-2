5|$|Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat {{album that}} begins with an entirely {{instrumental}} first half, which features free form interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer Tony Allen. <b>It</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an extended mid-tempo section with Allen's polyrhythms and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers call-and-response vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album.|$|E
40|$|Background: Since no {{study has}} been done {{regarding}} use of library in medical students in North India and very few studies in whole of India that is why this study was conceived. Objective: To study the use of library by medical students in all the professional courses in Government Medical College, Chandigarh U. T. Material and Methods: 235 students were administered pre-structured and pre-tested proforma in classroom and guided filling of proforma was done by authors. Results: Maximum students (265) were in {{the age group of}} 18 - 25 years. 122 students felt that their objectives were partially fulfilled in the library, 71 felt their objectives were fully fulfilled in the library, while 20 felt none of their objectives were fulfilled in the library. 64. 5 % students were visiting library for updating their knowledge, 31. 7 % for retrieving literature, 18. 7 % for information on a specific disease, 12. 6 % for research purposes, 6. 7 % for diagnosis, 2. 6 % for publications, 2. 2 % for patient care. Among the IT services available 57 % were using computer, 54. 1 % were utilising internet, 47. 01 % were using E mail, 32. 5 % were using E books, 31. 3 %were using CD ROM, and 28. 3 % were using telephone. Out of benefits available of using IT services 75. 7 % said <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> better access to information, 51. 8 % said it provided quick information, 42. 9 % said <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> contact with distant personnel, 44. 75 % believed <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> improvement in quality of work, 22. 7 %said <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> decrease in use of postal mail, 10. 8 % said <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> decrease in use of telephone, 10. 1 % said <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> decrease in use of print version. 34. 3 %(91) students opined that there was need for an orientation programme regarding the use of IT services in the library...|$|R

5000|$|This book {{is based}} on the Hindu philosophies that One is All, and that All is One (Page one of Preface). The Science of Getting Rich is based upon what Wattles called [...] "the Certain Way of Thinking." [...] According to Mitch Horowitz, the {{editor-in-chief}} of the Jeremy Tarcher imprint of Penguin Books, which reprinted The Science of Getting Rich in 2007, Wattles' [...] "Certain Way" [...] descended from the [...] "mental healing movement" [...] that had started earlier with Phineas P. Quimby in the mid-19th century. As Horowitz explained to a reporter from the Washington Post, after experiencing relief from physical symptoms of discomfort or illness through Quimby's mental strategies, people began to wonder, [...] "If my state of mind seems to have a positive influence over how I feel physically, what other things can it do? Can <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> prosperity? Can <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> happiness in my home? Can <b>it</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> finding love and romance?"

5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, <b>it</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for {{this appears to be}} the phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E

The ceiling of this hall is formed from a single stone. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has a central image of Ganesha as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar, facing the North. The Ganesha image is depicted in a seated posture with its trunk turning to the left, four arms and three eyes. He holds a noose (pasha) and elephant goad (ankusha) in his upper hands, while his lower right rests on his knee {{and the other one}} holds a modaka (a sweet). The navel and the eyes are embedded with diamonds. A cobra hood raised over Ganesha's head, shelters the Lord. The image is actually smaller than it looks as it is smeared with a thick level of saffron-coloured Sindoor (vermillion), which peels off once every century. It last fell off in 1882, and prior to that in 1788. Ganesha is flanked by idols of his consorts Riddhi and Siddhi sometimes called Siddhi and Buddhi. These idols are made of an alloy of five metals or of brass. The deities are covered with crafted silver and gold. Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the central Ganesha image is believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring {{in the form of an}} elephant-faced stone. In front of the central image, the vahanas of Ganesha – the mouse and the peacock are placed. To the left outside the garbhagriha is an image of Nagna-Bhairava.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, <b>it</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> cold temperatures while during summer, <b>it</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
