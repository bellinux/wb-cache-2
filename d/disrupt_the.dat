5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E

5|$|From {{the middle}} of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> newly created French bureaucracy, to disrupt their {{military}} outposts and to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels {{under the command of}} Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.|$|E

5|$|The Venizelist advance was not {{an attempt}} to {{undermine}} the king's pact with Bénazet, since it had been planned long before that.

5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the start of the operations, the Soviet night bombers {{attacked}} the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> German command and control. The bombers also attacked German airfields and communication centres to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> flow of reinforcements. Operation Iskra began at 9:30 on January 12, when the two Soviet fronts began their artillery preparation, which lasted for 2 hours 20 minutes on the western side and 1 hour 45 minutes on the eastern side of the bottleneck. The Soviet attack started five minutes before the artillery preparation finished with a Katyusha barrage, to fully exploit its effects.|$|E

5|$|An NBA player {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000. The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and new players could <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> teams.|$|E
5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|At party {{meetings}} in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to disrupt Adolf Hitler's speeches, and fought with party members. It {{was decided that}} a permanent group of party members would serve to protect Nazi officials at rallies and <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> meetings of opposing parties. The basis for the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) had been formed. Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA. In 1923, Heiden joined a small personal bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler named Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{a series}} of Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands took place between November 1944 and January 1945. These raids {{targeted}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases and sought to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando raids on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
