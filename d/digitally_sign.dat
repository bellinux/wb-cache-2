40|$|Abstract — The {{action of}} <b>digitally</b> <b>signing</b> has several {{intrinsic}} weaknesses that introduce syntactic and semantic distance between a signer and a relying party. As a result, <b>digitally</b> <b>signed</b> documents cannot be trusted and thus be widely deployed in pervasive environments. We evaluate the syntactic robustness of <b>digitally</b> <b>signed</b> documents by exploiting one key quantitative measure (the structural informativeness) and by comparing several qualitative characteristics of various alternative syntaxes. We are then {{able to identify}} which is the more reliable and simpler to transform syntax that will enhance the pervasiveness of signed documents, while {{it can be used}} in resource-constraint mobile devices. At the same time, <b>digitally</b> <b>signed</b> documents must preserve their security characteristics and their formatting and layout capabilities in order to achieve an enhanced level of trust on the semantic part of communication and thus be ubiquitously integrated with human users...|$|R

50|$|A {{bitcoin is}} defined by a {{sequence}} of <b>digitally</b> <b>signed</b> transactions {{that began with the}} bitcoin's creation, as a block reward. The owner of a bitcoin transfers it by <b>digitally</b> <b>signing</b> it over to the next owner using a bitcoin transaction, much like endorsing a traditional bank check.

Unlike traditional check endorsements, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which eliminates risk of chargeback fraud.|$|R
