40|$|BACKGROUND: Using a questionnaire, the EC 4 (European Communities Confederation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) has {{collated}} {{an inventory}} of the accreditation procedures for medical laboratories in the EU. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Accreditation of medical laboratories in {{the countries of the}} EU is mostly carried out in cooperation with national accreditation bodies. These national accreditation bodies work together in a regional cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation (EA). Professionals are trained to become assessors and play a prominent role in the accreditation process. The extent of the training is diverse, but assessors are kept informed and up-to-date by annual meetings. The frequency of assessments and surveillance visits differs from country to country and ranges from 1 to 4 years. More harmonisation is needed in this respect, based on a frequency that can be pragmatically handled by laboratory professionals. In the majority of EA bodies, accreditation is carried out on a test-by-test basis. Many professionals would prefer accreditation of the entire service provided within the actual field of testing (i. e., haematology, immunology, etc.), with accreditation granted if the majority of tests offered within a service field fulfil the requirements of the ISO 15189 standard. The scope of accreditation is a major point of discussions between the EC 4 Working Group on Accreditation and representatives of accreditation bodies in the <b>EA</b> Medical <b>Laboratory</b> Committee...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research has been conducted}} into the use of stable isotopes to assist in determining the origin of various materials. The research conducted in the forensic field shows the potential of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to provide a level of discrimination not achievable utilizing traditional forensic techniques. Despite the research there have been few, if any, publications addressing the validation and measurement uncertainty of the technique for forensic applications. This study, the first in a planned series, presents validation data for the measurement of bulk nitrogen isotope ratios in ammonium nitrate (AN) using the DELTAplusXP (Thermo Finnigan) IRMS instrument equipped with a ConFlo III interface and FlashEA™ 1112 elemental analyzer (<b>EA).</b> Appropriate <b>laboratory</b> standards, analytical methods and correction calculations were developed and evaluated. A validation protocol was developed in line with the guidelines provided by the National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA). Performance characteristics including: accuracy, precision/repeatability, reproducibility/ruggedness, robustness, linear range, and measurement uncertainty were evaluated for the measurement of nitrogen isotope ratios in AN. AN (99. 5 %) and ammonium thiocyanate (99. 99 +%) were determined to be the most suitable laboratory standards and were calibrated against international standards (certified reference materials). All performance characteristics were within an acceptable range when potential uncertainties, including the manufacturer's uncertainty of the technique and standards, were taken into account. The experiments described in this article {{could be used as a}} model for validation of other instruments for similar purposes. Later studies in this series will address the more general issue of demonstrating that the IRMS technique is scientifically sound and fit-for-purpose in the forensic explosives analysis field. © 2010, Wiley-Blackwell.

This molecular feature is more frequent in young patients, with no/light smoking habit and with adenocarcinoma pathological subtype. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting ALK, ROS 1, RON, and MET. The preclinical efficacy results led to a fast-track clinical development. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was achieved after the Phase I clinical trial in 2011 in ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC progressing after a first-line treatment. In 2013, the randomized Phase III trial PROFILE- 1007 confirmed the efficacy of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy, in second-line setting or more. In 2014, the PROFILE- 1014 trial showed the superiority of crizotinib in the first-line setting compared to the pemetrexed platinum doublet chemotherapy. The response rate was 74 %, and the progression-free survival was 10. 9  months with crizotinib. Based on these results, crizotinib received approval from the FDA and European Medicines Agency for first-line treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The various molecular mechanisms {{at the time of}} the progression (ALK mutations or amplification, ALK-independent mechanisms) encourage performing re-biopsy at the time of progression under crizotinib. The best treatment strategy at the progression (crizotinib continuation beyond progression, switch to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or cytotoxic chemotherapy) depends on the phenotype of the progression, the molecular status, and the physical condition of the patient.

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} to our study. First, we developed severe pneumonia in previously healthy and young animals. Thus, {{in comparison with the}} clinical scenario, we may have underestimated the pulmonary and hemodynamic response to pneumonia; additionally, we may have also undervalued the clinical benefit of PMX-HP in septic patients with comorbidities. Second, upon autopsy, we did not perform histology studies; thus, we may have missed significant additional benefits associated with clearance of pulmonary endotoxin. Third, as shown in Additional file 2, we found a mildly variable association between EA and P. aeruginosa or E. coli blood endotoxin concentration. Importantly, following formation of endotoxin–antibody complexes the assay utilizes polymorphonuclear leukocytes’ chemiluminescence to compute the <b>EA</b> [23]. Previous <b>laboratory</b> studies corroborated the applicability of the EA assay for the measurement of endotoxin in canine blood samples [36]. Yet, in pig’s blood, the oxidant release by neutrophils and the resulting light emission could vary in comparison with humans. Thus, the absolute values of endotoxin concentration and EA of our study are useful, but must be interpreted with caution. Additionally, it should be emphasized that some investigators recently questioned the reliability of EA assay in humans versus older methods, such as the limulus amebocyte lysate assay [37]. Fourth, during acute stresses, release of quiescent endotoxin into the bloodstream by endogenous Gram-negative flora of the gastrointestinal tract is substantial in humans [38 – 41]. This may not be relevant in pigs with pneumonia and could have further underestimated the effects of PMX-HP. Fifth, in the present study, and in previous similar studies in septic pigs [42], the infection was untreated. This was aimed at studying the effects of PMX-HP in a scenario of sustained infection and consistent high level of endotoxemia. Yet, in clinical settings, antibiotic-induced release of endotoxin from pathogens could be significant [43, 44], particularly during the first hours of antimicrobial treatment. Consistently, in previous positive clinical study [8], patients were treated with antibiotics—following abdominal surgery—and PMX-HP helped clearing the residual endotoxin. Thus, we cannot fully reject the synergistic effects of PMX-HP in treated patients, which should be further evaluated in future investigations. Finally, our study lacks of a control group without pulmonary bacterial challenge. This additional group could have further increased the scientific value of the study and comparisons among groups.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlasma {{characterization}} {{and biological}} testsIn the world, 1. 4 million persons suffer from infectious complications acquired in hospital 1. Sterilization of medical devices {{are crucial to}} world public safety. Conventional sterilization methods (moist heat, ionizing irradiation and chemical treatment) are not compatible with the most recently developed materials because of the poor resistance of some sensitive materials to sterilizing agents. New sterilization techniques using glow discharge 2, 3 plasma and afterglow discharge 4, 5 plasmahave been studied by several research groups. In {{the framework of the}} PLAS’STER project, a prototype based on a RF plasma confined inside sterilization pouches for the treatment of medical devices has been developed. In our process, the medical device to be sterilized is placed in a special medical sealed pouch allowing a gas flow such as Argon, Nitrogen and Oxygen. The pouch is set on the power electrode. By tuning the pressure difference between the reactor chamber and the pouch, the plasma is kept confined inside the pouches. The major advantage of dealing with packaged medical devices is to preserve their on-self sterility without any additional precautions before further use. Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) was used to study the plasma emission from VUV/UV to IR wavelengths range. Beside typical emission of the feed gas such oxygen atomic in oxygen plasma, several emissions are due to impurities and to the reaction of the plasma with the surrounding pouch. Chemical measurements have detectedsmall surface modifications on pouches wall without altering barrier properties. Plasma electron density has been measured by microwave interferometry (MWI) between 1. 108 cm- 3 and 2, 9. 109 cm- 3 depending on the gas and the RF power. By coupling MWI and OES diagnostics, the variation of the argon 750, 4 nm line intensityin function of RF power have shown the same trend as the electron density. The effectiveness of our process has been demonstrated for sterilization with bacteriological tests performed <b>EA</b> 4691 BIOS <b>Laboratory.</b> A 6 log reduction on Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained in 45 minutes in different gases.

Capillary rarefaction, an early event in COPD before vascular remodeling, is a potential mechanism of exercise-induced and resting arterial hypertension. Impaired training-induced capillarization was observed earlier in COPD patients; thus, this study compares the changes in blood pressure (BP) during exercise in COPD patients and matches control subjects (CSs) after a similar exercise training program, in relationship with muscle capillarization. Methods: Resting and maximal exercise diastolic pressure (DP) and systolic pressure (SP) were recorded during a standardized cardiopulmonary exercise test, and a quadriceps muscle biopsy was performed before and after training. Results: A total of 35 CSs and 49 COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 second= 54 %± 22 % predicted) completed a 6 -week rehabilitation program and improved their symptom-limited maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 SL: 25. 8 ± 6. 1  mL/kg per minute vs 27. 9  mL/kg per minute and 17. 0 ± 4. 7  mL/kg per minute vs 18. 3  mL/kg per minute; both P< 0. 001). The improvement in muscle capillary-to-fiber (C/F) ratio was significantly greater in CSs vs COPD patients (+ 11 %± 9 % vs + 23 %± 21 %; P< 0. 05). Although maximal exercise BP was reduced in CSs (DP: 89 ± 10  mmHg vs 85 ± 9  mmHg; P< 0. 001 /SP: 204 ± 25  mmHg vs 196 ± 27  mmHg; P< 0. 05), it did not change in COPD patients (DP: 94 ± 14  mmHg vs 97 ± 16  mmHg; P= 0. 46 /SP: 202 ± 27  mmHg vs 208 ± 24  mmHg; P= 0. 13). The change in muscle C/F ratio was negatively correlated with maximal exercise SP in CSs and COPD patients (r=- 0. 41; P= 0. 02).

There is a need to provide the minimal important difference (MID) of this test in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Methods: COPD patients undergoing the 1 -minute STS test before PR were included. The test was performed at baseline and the end of PR, as well as the 6 -minute walk test, and the quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction (QMVC). Home and community-based programs were conducted as recommended. Responsiveness to PR was determined by the difference in the 1 -minute STS test between baseline and the end of PR. The MID was evaluated using distribution and anchor-based methods. Results: Forty-eight COPD patients were included. At baseline, the significant predictors of the number of 1 -minute STS repetitions were the 6 -minute walk distance (6 MWD) (r= 0. 574; P< 10 - 3), age (r=- 0. 453; P= 0. 001), being on long-term oxygen treatment (r=- 0. 454; P= 0. 017), and the QMVC (r= 0. 424; P= 0. 031). The multivariate analysis explained 75. 8 % of the variance of 1 -minute STS repetitions. The improvement of the 1 -minute STS repetitions at the end of PR was 3. 8 ± 4. 2 (P< 10 - 3). It was mainly correlated with the change in QMVC (r= 0. 572; P= 0. 004) and 6 MWD (r= 0. 428; P= 0. 006). Using the distribution-based analysis, an MID of 1. 9 (standard error of measurement method) or 3. 1 (standard deviation method) was found. With the 6 MWD as anchor, the receiver operating characteristic curve identified the MID for the change in 1 -minute STS repetitions at 2. 5 (sensibility: 80 %, specificity: 60 %) with area under curve of 0. 716. Conclusion: The 1 -minute STS test is simple and sensitive to measure the efficiency of PR. An improvement of at least three repetitions is consistent with physical benefits after PR.

Para se avaliar a influÃncia dos sistemas de exploraÃÃo agrÃcola (SE) â orgÃnico (SO) e convencional (SC) â em cana-de-aÃÃcar, foi conduzida, na Unidade Agroindustrial da YpiÃca, localizada no municÃpio de Pindoretama-CE, uma pesquisa de campo utilizando-se as variedades (V) CB 38 - 22 (CB), RB 72454 (RB) e SP 71 - 6949 (SP). Os tratamentos constaram da combinaÃÃo de trÃs V com trÃs SE: orgÃnica acrescida do coquetel de sementes (OCS); orgÃnica acrescida do plantio de feijÃo-de-corda (cv. Epace 10) entre as linhas (OE 10) e plantio convencional (SC). O delineamento experimental foi o inteiramente casualizado com quatro repetiÃÃes. As avaliaÃÃes agronÃmica e industrial foram feitas em marÃo de 2005, na primeira soca. Foram determinados os valores da Ãrea foliar (AF), do Ãndice de Ãrea foliar (IAF) e do diÃmetro (DC), nÃmero (NC), comprimento (CC) e produtividade de colmos (RC). Para a anÃlise de Brix, POL e Pureza, foram colhidos dez colmos de cada parcela e extraÃdo o caldo para anÃlise em laboratÃrio. Os SE diferiram estatisticamente entre si para as variÃveis: AF, IAF e NC. Os maiores valores de AF e IAF foram obtidos nos SO (OCS e OE 10). JÃ o maior NC foi obtido no tratamento OCS. Com relaÃÃo Ãs V, apenas as variÃveis AF e IAF nÃo diferiram estatisticamente. NÃo se observaram diferenÃas estatÃsticas para as interaÃÃes entre V e SE nas diversas variÃveis estudadas. Os melhores rendimentos de colmos foram obtidos nas V RB (41, 1 t/ha) e SP (38, 2 t/ha), contra 29, 0 t/ha na CB. A variÃvel DC foi a que mais contribuiu para o RC das V. Constatou-se, tambÃm, uma relaÃÃo positiva entre CC e DC. Com relaÃÃo Ãs variÃveis industriais, observaram-se diferenÃas estatÃsticas para POL e Pureza entre os SE e POL entre V. JÃ o Brix nÃo sofreu quaisquer influÃncias de V e SE. Assim como para as variÃveis agronÃmicas, tambÃm nÃo se verificaram interaÃÃes estatisticamente significativas entre SE e V para as industriais. O SC apresentou o maior POL (14, 21 %) e, entre V, o maior valor de POL foi obtido na RB. Os maiores valores de Pureza, 71, 52 e 69, 14 %, foram obtidos nos sistemas SC e OCS, respectivamente.

Agronomic and industrial evaluations were made in March of 2005, in the first beat. Foliar area values (FA), foliar area index (FAI) and diameter (DC), number (NC), length (CC), and productivity of stalks (RC) were determined. For Brix, POL, and Purity analysis, ten stalks of each parcel were harvested and the broth extracted to be examined in <b>laboratory.</b> <b>EA</b> differed statistically one from another for the variables: AF, IAF and NC. The biggest FA and FAI values were gotten from OS (OSC e OE 10). The biggest NC was gotten in the treatment OSC. Relating to V, only variables FA and FAI did not differ statistically. Statistical differences were not observed for interaction between V and EA. The best stalk profits were gotten from V RB (41, t/ha) and SP (38, 2 t/ha), against 29, 0 t/ha in the CB. The variable DC was the one that most contributed to the RC of the V. It was also evidenced a positive relation between CC and DC.
