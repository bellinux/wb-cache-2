The {{remainder}} of the SSRF {{under the command of}} Captain Geoffrey Appleyard had departed earlier aboard a troop transport ship. On 20 September 1941 after six weeks under sail Maid Honor arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone. Freetown was the agreed rendezvous <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups,</b> Appleyard's party having arrived at the end of August. After Maid Honors arrival in Freetown the search for the German submarine bases started. Sailing into the many rivers and deltas in the area, they failed to locate any submarines or evidence of a submarine base.|$|E

25|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} or aortic regurgitation can {{be treated}} either medically or surgically, depending on the acuteness of presentation, the symptoms and signs associated with the disease process, {{and the degree of}} left ventricular dysfunction.

25|$|With {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the War Office planned for CRUs to accept only Far East {{prisoners of war}} (FEPOWs), based on the {{assumption}} that the CRUs would not be able to manage the combined number of POWs from Europe and the Far East and that the FEPOWs were more in need of the service. Wilson and Rendel felt that European POWs should not be denied the opportunity to attend, and went to lengths to expand the programme where possible and make space <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> Rendel and Wilson were removed from heading the programme as a result. By the end of March 1947, more than 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended a CRU.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1908 {{the plan}} to remove the {{dictator}} was approved by Afonso Costa and Francisco Correia Herédia (Viscount of Ribeira Brava) <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> of dissidents. Meanwhile, other conspirators were not only interested in removing João Franco, but also eliminating the King. This change in plans is harder to pinpoint, but a recent study points {{to the end of}} 1907. José Maria Alpoim, who associated with members of the Carbonária, was responsible for a plan to acquire arms, promulgate a revolution, and two plans to execute the Prime Minister and the monarch. Whether republican leaders were aware of these plans is unclear; the relationships that existed between the conspirators and instigators of the coupe were later suppressed. But, these competing motivations likely played a part in the disorganization {{on the eve of the}} coupe, which was planned for either January 31 or February 1.|$|E

25|$|Up to this point, the Emu {{had been}} the only serial {{publication}} produced by the RAOU for all members, and was by far the biggest financial cost to the organisation. For a majority of members the receipt of the journal was the only direct contact they had with the RAOU. Yet the content of Emu was being assailed from both the 'scientists' who wanted more rigour and less in-house material, and from the 'amateurs' who disliked the scientific language of many papers. The long-term solution would be to cater separately <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> The start of this process came with the decision by the RAOU Council in 1968 to allow for a type of membership without a subscription to Emu. The next step was when Jack Hyett resigned as editor of Emu in 1968, the ACT Branch nominated Stephen Marchant for the editorship, and he was elected unopposed. Marchant was editor for the next twelve years and he transformed Emu into the lean and rigorous journal the 'scientists' wanted.|$|E
25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

500|$|Pet Sounds and Sgt.

Between Pet Sounds and Sgt.

500|$|At {{their peak}} in the Paleozoic, the brachiopods {{were among the most}} {{abundant}} filter-feeders and reef-builders, and occupied other ecological niches, including swimming in the jet-propulsion style of scallops. However, after the Permian–Triassic extinction event, informally known as the [...] "Great Dying", brachiopods recovered only a third of their former diversity. It was often thought that brachiopods were actually declining in diversity, and that in some way bivalves out-competed them. However, [...] in 1980, Gould and Calloway produced a statistical analysis that concluded that: both brachiopods and bivalves increased {{all the way from the}} Paleozoic to modern times, but bivalves increased faster; the Permian–Triassic extinction was moderately severe for bivalves but devastating for brachiopods, so that brachiopods for the first time were less diverse than bivalves and their diversity after the Permian increased from a very low base; there is no evidence that bivalves out-competed brachiopods, and short-term increases or decreases <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> appeared synchronously. In 2007 Knoll and Bambach concluded that brachiopods were one of several groups that were most vulnerable to the Permian–Triassic extinction, as all had calcareous hard parts (made of calcium carbonate) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems.|$|E
