40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1), a pro{{inflammatory}} cytokine, is related with inflammatory diseases and it up-regulates MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion. This {{study was designed}} to investigate the signal transduction pathway of the IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion in human airway epithelial cells. In cultured human airway NCI-H 292 epithelial cells, the steady state of the mRNA level of MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion induced by IL- 1 were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme immunoassay, and immunoblot analysis. To observe the signal pathway of the IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion, we used several specific inhibitors. PD 98059 (MEK/ERK inhibitor) suppressed IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion, while SB 203580 (p 38 inhibitor) did not. Ro 31 - 8220 (PKC inhibitor) inhibited IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion. It inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but did not inhibit p 38 phosphorylation. LY 294002 (PI 3 K inhibitor) also suppressed MUC 2 expression, but did not inhibit any MAPKs phosphorylation. These results suggest that the IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion in NCI-H 292 cells are regulated through activation of the PKC-MEK/ERK pathway, and that PI 3 K is also involved in the IL- 1 -mediated MUC 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> mucin secretion...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the relationship between fibroblast telomerase <b>expression,</b> myofibroblasts, <b>and</b> telomerase-mediated regulatory signals in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Thirty-four surgical lung biopsies, which had been obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and histologically classified as usual interstitial pneumonia, were examined. Immunohistochemistry {{was used to evaluate}} fibroblast telomerase expression, myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> the tissue <b>expression</b> of inter leu kin- 4, transforming growth factor-&# 946;, and basic fibroblast growth factor. The point-counting technique was used to quantify the expression of these markers in unaffected, collapsed, mural fibrosis, and honeycombing areas. The results were correlated to patient survival. RESULTS: Fibroblast telomerase <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> basic fibroblast growth factor tissue expression were higher in collapsed areas, whereas myofibroblast <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> interleukine- 4 tissue expression were higher in areas of mural fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-&# 946; expression was higher in collapsed, mural fibrosis and honeycombing areas in comparison to unaffected areas. Positive correlations were found between basic fibroblast growth factor tissue <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> fibroblast telomerase <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> between interleukin- 4 tissue <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin expression. Negative correlations were observed between interleukin- 4 <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> basic fibroblast growth factor tissue expression in areas of mural fibrosis. Myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> interleukin- 4 tissue expression in areas of mural fibrosis were negatively associated with patient survival. CONCLUSION: Fibroblast telomerase expression is higher in areas of early remodeling in lung tissues demonstrating typical interstitial pneumonia, whereas myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin expression predominates in areas of late remodeling. These events seem to be regulated by basic fibroblast growth factor and interleukin- 4 tissue expression, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} CD 38 catalyzes {{the synthesis}} of the calcium mobilizing molecule cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD. In human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, the <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> function of CD 38 are augmented by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leading to increased intracellular calcium response to agonists. A glucocorticoid response element in the CD 38 gene has been computationally described, providing evidence for transcriptional regulation of its expression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, on CD 38 <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in HASM cells stimulated with TNF-alpha. In HASM cells, TNF-alpha augmented CD 38 <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, which were attenuated by dexamethasone. TNF-alpha increased NF-kappaB <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> its activation, and dexamethasone partially reversed these effects. TNF-alpha increased the <b>expression</b> of IkappaBalpha, <b>and</b> dexamethasone increased it further. An inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation or transfection of cells with IkappaB mutants decreased TNF-alpha-induced CD 38 expression. The results indicate that TNF-alpha-induced CD 38 expression involves NF-kappaB <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> its activation and dexamethasone inhibits CD 38 <b>expression</b> through NF-kappaB-dependent <b>and</b> -independent mechanisms. 1529...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 on cytokine <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion from placental explants. Study design Placentas were collected from healthy pregnancies at term elective caesarean delivery and trophoblast explants were prepared and treated with Ucn 2 or Ucn 3 in presence/absence of the selective CRH-R 2 antagonist, astressin 2 b. The mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of IL- 10 and TNF-α were evaluated by Real Time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Main outcome measures To evaluate the possible role of Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 in inflammatory pathways. Results Ucn 2 increased the mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of IL- 10 and TNF-α, and Ucn 3 increased the mRNA <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of IL- 10, but did not modify the secretion of TNF-α. Ucn 3 treatment reversed the LPS-induce increase of TNF-α <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> release, an effect blocked by astressin 2 b. Ucn 2 potentiated the LPS-induced increase of TNF-α <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> release, an effect reversed by astressin 2 b. Conclusions The present study showed that Ucn 2 and Ucn 3 differentially regulate the LPS-induced TNF-α <b>and</b> IL- 10 <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion in trophoblast explants acting through CRH-R 2.

40|$|Maternal {{peripheral}} {{insulin resistance}} and increased inflammation are two features of pregnancies, complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise {{a wide range}} of microbial products, as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether levels of NOD 1 and NOD 2 are increased in adipose tissue of women with GDM. The effect of NOD 1 and NOD 2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. NOD 1, but not NOD 2, expression was higher in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from women with GDM when compared with those from women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In both omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues from NGT and GDM women, the NOD 1 ligand g-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) significantly induced the <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL 6) and chemokine IL 8; COX 2 (PTGS 2) gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> subsequent prostaglandin production; the <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of the extracellular matrix remodelling enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) <b>and</b> the gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of the adhesion molecules ICAM 1 and VCAM 1. There was no effect of the NOD 2 ligand muramyl dipeptide on any of the endpoints tested. The effects of the NOD 1 ligand iE-DAP were mediated via NFκB, as the NFκB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082 significantly attenuated iE-DAP-induced <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX 2 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> subsequent prostaglandin production, MMP 9 <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion and ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 gene <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> secretion.
