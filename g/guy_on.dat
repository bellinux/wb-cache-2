Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E

25|$|In 1302 or 1303, {{following}} the sudden {{death of the}} ruler of Thessaly Constantine Doukas, the region passed into the hands of his underage son, John II. The regent of Epirus, Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, saw an opportunity to annex Thessaly into her state, and invaded its territory, seizing the town of Fanari. Guy II, whom his uncle Constantine Doukas had appointed as steward of John II until he came of age, reacted by quickly mobilizing his vassals, Boniface of Verona among them. According to the Chronicle of the Morea, Boniface joined Guy and the Marshal of the Principality of Achaea, Nicholas III of Saint Omer, with a hundred knights. The large Latin host impressed Anna, who quickly offered to abandon Fanari in return for peace. Her proposal was accepted, and the Latin army moved north into Byzantine lands around Thessalonica, until Empress Yolande of Montferrat, who held the city as her own domain, convinced them to withdraw without further incident. In 1308, Venice accused Boniface, along with Guy, Anthony le Flamenc, and Bernat Rocaforte, the leader of the Catalan Company, of plotting to seize the Venetian colony of the city of Negroponte, but {{the sudden death of}} <b>Guy</b> <b>on</b> 5 October, without leaving an heir, changed the situation.

500|$|Crosby's {{return in}} advance of the playoffs {{resulted}} in many experts predicting that the Penguins would win their second Stanley Cup in four years, and though the Penguins were accordingly picked to oust the Philadelphia Flyers in their first round series, it was acknowledged {{that it would be a}} tough series for both teams. The Flyers shocked the Penguins by winning the first three consecutive games, the third of which saw the teams combine for 158 penalty minutes. After the 8–4 loss in game 3, Crosby was widely criticized for his conduct during the game, and for his testy post-game interview. When asked about an incident where Flyer forward Jakub Voráček had dropped his glove and Crosby swatted it away with his stick before Voráček could pick it up, Crosby replied, saying [...] "I don't like any <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> their team there, so his glove was near me, went to pick it up, and I pushed it, so yeah, that's...

[...] The Penguins went on to win the next two games, but ultimately lost the series in game 6. Crosby would finish with 3 goals and 5 assists in the 6 games. On June 28, 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that Crosby had agreed to a 12-year, $104.4M contract extension that will keep Crosby in Pittsburgh through the 2024–25 NHL season, unless he is traded during this period.|$|E
