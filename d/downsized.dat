40|$|Organizational <b>downsizing,</b> {{defined as}} a {{reduction}} in workforce, is a common strategy implemented by firms {{for the purpose of}} improving an organization 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency, work processes, or cost structure. However, previous research has shown that <b>downsizing</b> seldom generates positive results at a macro or micro level. It has been demonstrated that <b>downsizing</b> has a negative impact on financial performance, such as Return on Assets, Return on Investments, and profits in the long-term. <b>Downsizing</b> also has a negative impact on the remaining workers left employed, referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 survivors 2 ̆ 2. Survivors typically respond to <b>downsizing</b> by exhibiting negative attitudes and behaviors such as: decreasing employee morale, commitment, motivation, loyalty, work effort, and trust. Trust, in particular, {{has been shown to be}} critical component in survivors 2 ̆ 7 responses to <b>downsizing</b> and is decreased through perceived violations of psychological contracts of employment and perceptions of organizational injustice. However, there is little understanding about how <b>downsizing</b> impacts survivors 2 ̆ 7 collective trust in the long-term. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine how <b>downsizing</b> affects collective trust over time using a Latent Growth Curve Analysis (LCA). LCA allowed us to determine the trajectory of collective trust when <b>downsizing</b> occurs which we found to be nonlinear with diminishing returns. We found collective trust initially decreases in time period two but shows a slight rebound in the subsequent time. This suggests that the levels of collective trust decrease as a result of <b>downsizing.</b> We also found that organizational variables such as the severity of <b>downsizing,</b> voluntary turnover, and CEO pay moderate the relationship between <b>downsizing</b> and collective trust by magnifying the negative relationship between <b>downsizing</b> and collective trust. We also found that CEO tenure moderates the relationship between <b>downsizing</b> and collective trust by suppressing the negative relationship between <b>downsizing</b> and collective trust.

This research project treats <b>downsizing</b> {{as a form of}} strategic change and focuses on how integrated human resource practices and role of change agent can contribute to the success of <b>downsizing</b> strategy. By success, it is meant here the level of return earned by investing in <b>downsizing</b> strategy. This study considers the economic perspective of <b>downsizing</b> and study <b>downsizing</b> as investment strategy. The idea on which this research is based is that organisations <b>downsize</b> to manage their investments in assets.

40|$|While {{there is}} an {{extensive}} body of work on how organizational routines emerge and evolve over time, there is a scarcity of research on what happens when routines are disrupted or disbanded through the elimination of key individuals involved in them. This study {{is the first to}} theorize and empirically examine the relationship between the magnitude of workforce <b>downsizing</b> and firm performance applying an organizational routine perspective. Consistent with prior research on organizational routines, we posit that small-scale <b>downsizing</b> leads to efficiency improvements without disrupting the existing routines. While larger routine disruptions occur in both medium- and large-scale <b>downsizing,</b> we further argue and find that large-scale <b>downsizing</b> tends to be more beneficial than medium-scale <b>downsizing.</b> Building on prior research on routines, we reason that in medium-scale <b>downsizing</b> employees try to salvage the impaired, partially functioning routines, while large-scale <b>downsizing</b> requires a more fundamental rethinking and re-creation of routines leading to more positive outcomes. Our study contributes to <b>downsizing</b> research through the application of the organizational routine perspective to explain the financial outcomes of <b>downsizing.</b> In doing so, we depart from the widely held assumption in the <b>downsizing</b> literature that the relationship between the magnitude of <b>downsizing</b> and firm performance is linear.

40|$|Even {{after three}} decades, organisations {{worldwide}} have continued {{the practice of}} <b>downsizing.</b> Interestingly, {{the reasons for the}} differences in leaders 2 ̆ 7 approaches to <b>downsizing</b> still remain unclear. This study therefore, was primarily driven by the central research question: Why would leaders differ in their approaches to <b>downsizing?</b> Within the <b>downsizing</b> literature, the role of some internal factors (e. g. mutual trust, team composition and structure, managerial ideologies) has been analysed and that of others (e. g. dynamic managerial capabilities) has been alluded to, without being followed up by actual research. However, the systematic links between <b>downsizing</b> strategies, and leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture have not been empirically established to date, and this study applies the initiative to such efforts. In order to answer the central research question, the present study was conducted under two premises, viz. ideal and practical. Under ideal conditions, the intent was to identify the ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategy types and subsequently the leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture dimensions, so as to determine which leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture dimensions are favourable for which ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategy type. However, under practical conditions, the intent was to identify the practical <b>downsizing</b> strategy types and only organisational culture dimensions, so as to determine which cultural dimension is favourable for which practical <b>downsizing</b> strategy type. The research data was gathered from 255 mid-level leaders in ten publicly-funded Australian universities through a postal survey, and then analysed using exploratory factor analysis, cluster analyses and one-way ANOVAs. Ideally and practically, three types of <b>downsizing</b> strategies were identified.;Based on these, four clusters were derived and analysed methodically across personality, leadership styles, personal values, and organisational culture. Empirical evidence suggests that leaders who ideally prefer forced <b>downsizing</b> have a higher tendency to make their attitudes clear to the team members - a characteristic of high task-oriented style; leaders who prefer voluntary <b>downsizing</b> have a lower tendency to make their attitudes clear to the team members - a characteristic of low task-oriented style; leaders who prefer student load <b>downsizing</b> have a lower tendency to act with consulting their team - a characteristic of low people-oriented style; leaders who prefer a very limited <b>downsizing</b> have a higher tendency to act with consulting their team - a characteristic of high people oriented style. However, personality, personal values, and organisational culture dimensions are not differentiated by the leaders who prefer different ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategies and also those who prefer a very limited <b>downsizing.</b> Furthermore, leaders who use a forced <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is less likely characterised by a personal freedom; leaders who use voluntary <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is less likely characterised by sociable and trusting; leaders who use a very limited <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is more likely characterised by a personal freedom, sociable and trusting. Interestingly, organisational culture dimensions are not differentiated by the leaders who use student load <b>downsizing.</b> This research makes following three key contributions to the theory and practice of <b>downsizing.</b> First, it has advanced empirical typologies of ideal and practical downsizing; second, it has developed empirical model of differences in approaches to ideal downsizing; third, it has developed empirical model of differences in approaches to practical downsizing.;The present research has addressed a gap in the <b>downsizing</b> literature concerning characteristics of leadership styles and organisational culture as explanatory factors for the differences in approaches to <b>downsizing.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes.

A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply <b>downsized</b> domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

This paper uses a new dataset of Chinese industrial enterprises to examine what leads to <b>downsizing,</b> and tries to understand the effects of labour <b>downsizing</b> on firms' technical efficiency, financial performance and employee wages.

For both SOEs and private firms, <b>downsizing</b> is more likely when the prices of their products drop, but private firms respond more dramatically. Moreover, <b>downsizing</b> has serious short-term costs in terms of total factor productivity (TFP). For mild <b>downsizing,</b> private firms suffer more deterioration in productivity. The distribution of surplus after <b>downsizing</b> is more favourable to labour in SOEs. For severe <b>downsizing,</b> both SOEs and private firms exhibit lower TFP growth with similar magnitudes.
