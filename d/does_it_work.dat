These missing details leave questions about the molecular actions inside the cell. What role does EF play in hindering the immune system? <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> with LF for its effect? How do the enzymes refold after translocation? Is there a chaperonin? Two proteins: KIF1C and the proteasome have shown a contribution to the effect of lethal toxin, but how do they contribute? Does LF target certain MAPKKs with a greater specificity? Does LF target other molecules too? ...|$|E
