50|$|The heliocentric <b>ecliptic</b> <b>system</b> {{describes}} the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and {{centers on the}} barycenter {{of the solar system}} (i.e. very close {{to the center of the}} Sun). The system is primarily used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, as well as defining their orbital elements.|$|E
50|$|From these bases, {{directions}} toward {{objects in}} the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to terrestrial longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system</b> specifies positions relative to the Earth's orbit, using celestial longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and <b>ecliptic</b> <b>systems,</b> some other celestial coordinate systems, such as the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.|$|R

The time period covered by each set of projections is 12 days and 6 hours, corresponding approximately to the period of IMP-J. The three coordinate systems used are the Geocentric Solar <b>Ecliptic</b> <b>system</b> (GSE), the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric system (GSM), and the Solar Magnetic system (SM). For {{each of the three}} projections, time ticks and codes are given on the satellite trajectories. The codes are interpreted in the table at the base of each plot.

The lunar principal axes of inertia are suggested as most appropriate for reference in lunar mapping and selenographic coordinate catalogues. The connection between the instantaneous axis of lunar rotation (involved in laser ranging, radar studies, astronomical observations {{from the surface of}} the moon and VLBI observations of ALSEPs), the <b>ecliptic</b> <b>system</b> of coordinates (which in reductions of observations was considered as fixed in space), the 'Cassini' mean selenographic coordinates (to which physical libration measures were referred), the lunar principal axes of inertia, and the invariable plane of the solar system is discussed...|$|E

50|$|The twelve astrological signs form a {{celestial}} coordinate system, or more specifically an <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system,</b> which takes the ecliptic as {{the origin of}} latitude and the Sun's position at vernal equinox as the origin of longitude.|$|R
5000|$|A {{position}} in the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system</b> is thus typically specified true equinox and ecliptic of date, mean equinox and ecliptic of J2000.0, or similar. Note {{that there is no}} [...] "mean ecliptic", as the ecliptic is not subject to small periodic oscillations.|$|R
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system.</b> The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{precession}} of the Earth's axis, {{the position}} of the vernal point on the celestial sphere changes over time, and the equatorial and the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>systems</b> change accordingly. Thus when specifying celestial coordinates for an object, one has to specify at what time the vernal point and the celestial equator are taken. That reference time is called the equinox of date.|$|R
50|$|Since antiquity the arcminute and {{arcsecond}} {{have been}} used in astronomy. In the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system,</b> latitude (β) and longitude (λ); in the horizon system, altitude (Alt) and azimuth (Az); and in the equatorial coordinate system, declination (δ), are all measured in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is Right ascension (RA) in equatorial coordinates, which is measured in time units of hours, minutes, and seconds.|$|R

A method using the distinctive features on the Moon is proposed for determing this true northern point...|$|R
5000|$|Because the {{division}} {{was made into}} equal arcs, 30° each, they constituted an ideal system of reference for making predictions about a planet's longitude. However, Babylonian techniques of observational measurements were in a rudimentary stage of evolution and they measured {{the position of a}} planet in reference to a set of [...] "normal stars" [...] close to the ecliptic (±9° of latitude) as observational reference points to help positioning a planet within this <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|The midheaven (MC) is a {{point of}} {{definition}} in the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system.</b> It aims to find the part of the ecliptic that corresponds to the highest point in a celestial object's apparent daily traverse of the visible sky, midway between its ascension on the eastern horizon and descension on the western horizon. The midheaven does not represent the point immediately overhead (our local zenith) or even the point of the ecliptic closest to it, but {{the point at which the}} local meridian intersects with the ecliptic.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ecliptic</b> {{coordinate}} <b>system</b> is {{a celestial}} coordinate system commonly used for representing the positions and orbits of Solar System objects. Because most planets (except Mercury), and many small Solar System bodies have orbits with small inclinations to the ecliptic, {{using it as}} thefundamental plane is convenient. The system's origin can be either {{the center of the}} Sun or the center of the Earth, its primary direction is towards the vernal (northbound) equinox, and it has a right-handed convention. It may be implemented in spherical coordinates or rectangular coordinates.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system.</b> The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).The ecliptic is not normally noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, carrying the observer through the cycles of sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion against the background of fixed stars.|$|R
50|$|The twelve sector {{division}} of the ecliptic constitutes astrology's primary frame of reference when considering the positions of celestial bodies, from a geocentric point of view, {{so that we may}} find, for instance, the Sun in 23° Aries (23° longitude), the Moon in 7° Scorpio (217° longitude), or Jupiter in 29° Pisces (359° longitude). Beyond the celestial bodies, other astrological points that are dependent on geographical location and time (namely, the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Vertex and the houses' cusps) are also referenced within this <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar <b>System's</b> <b>ecliptic</b> comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|R
50|$|Al-Kashi {{produced}} a Zij entitled the Khaqani Zij, {{which was based}} on Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's earlier Zij-i Ilkhani. In his Khaqani Zij, al-Kashi thanks the Timurid sultan and mathematician-astronomer Ulugh Beg, who invited al-Kashi to work at his observatory (see Islamic astronomy) and his university (see Madrasah) which taught theology. Al-Kashi produced sine tables to four sexagesimal digits (equivalent to eight decimal places) of accuracy for each degree and includes differences for each minute. He also produced tables dealing with transformations between coordinate systems on the celestial sphere, such as the transformation from the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system</b> to the equatorial coordinate system.|$|R

It is demonstrated how some interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations observed by both Explorers are consistent with local properties theoretically predicted for plane large-amplitude Alfven waves by Barnes and Hollweg (1974). The different types of angular motion of the magnetic field component normal to the direction of minimum variance may be indicative of the detailed conditions of the solar coronal plasma in the regions generating the Alfven waves, or some aspect of local generation...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the zodiac}} remains {{the basis of}} the <b>ecliptic</b> {{coordinate}} <b>system</b> in use in astronomy besides the equatorial one, the term and the names of the twelve signs are today mostly associated with horoscopic astrology. The term [...] "zodiac" [...] may also refer to the region of the celestial sphere encompassing the paths of the planets corresponding to the band of about eight arc degrees above and below the ecliptic. The zodiac of a given planet is the band that contains the path of that particular body; e.g., the [...] "zodiac of the Moon" [...] is the band of five degrees above and below the ecliptic. By extension, the [...] "zodiac of the comets" [...] may refer to the band encompassing most short-period comets.|$|R

It has the general shape of an elongated triaxial ellipsoid with ratios between the lengths of the axes equal to 15:9:5. Major surface features are {{on a scale of}} 10 km and the surface color does not vary significantly across the surface. In the <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system,</b> the pole of rotation is estimated to be oriented to the coordinates (λ0, β0) = (121° ± 10°, +37° ± 10°).|$|R

For the individual events, the high anisotropies of about 4 % are examined {{in terms of the}} convective, diffusive and density gradient components of the differential streaming as well as the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind. In each case, vector gradients are derived that lead to the observed anisotropies, and the magnitude of these gradients is typically 10 - 20 times that of the quiet time interplanetary gradient...|$|R

The mean ion bulk velocity is nearly anti-sunward (- 438, 34, 51 km/s) in GSE with a mean magnitude of about 442.2 km/s, and (433, 0, - 90 km/s) in the mean field-aligned (MFA) coordinate system with the z axis pointing {{in the direction of}} the mean {{magnetic field}} and the x–z plane spanning the mean magnetic field and the mean ion bulk velocity. The mean ion number density is 7.4 cm^- 3. The standard deviation of the magnetic field vector fluctuations is (2.2, 2.2, 3.3 nT) and that of the ion bulk velocity fluctuations is (15, 17, 16 km/s) in the GSE coordinate system. The observation is made in a slow solar wind.|$|R
40|$|The secular {{change in}} the mean motion of the moon, n, caused by the tidal {{dissipation}} in the ocean and solid earth is due primarily {{to the effect of}} the diurnal and semidiurnal tides. The long-period ocean tides produce an increase in n, but the effects are only 1 percent of the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean tides. In this investigation, expressions for these effects are obtained by developing the tidal potential in the <b>ecliptic</b> reference <b>system.</b> The computation of the amplitude of equilibrium tide and the phase corrections is also discussed. The averaged tidal deceleration of the moon's mean motion, n, from the most recent satellite ocean tide solutions is - 25. 25 +/- 0. 4 arcseconds/sq century. The value for n inferred from the satellite-determined ocean-tide solution is in good agreement with the value obtained from the analysis of 20 years of lunar laser-ranging observations...|$|R

Due to Precession of the Equinoxes the Fixed Stars appear to drift or move through space {{at the rate of}} 1 degree of Arc per 72 years. In order to fix the measurement to a specific date and degree of arc the values published through that scholarly work are utilized for the year 2000. All celestial bodies, including stars and constellations, are measured according to various fixed frameworks, in this instance a geocentric tropical zodiac. Cf. Heliocentric model as a fixed framework and sidereal and tropical astrology to identify the measuring system used here.

50|$|The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect, or YORP {{effect for}} short, changes the {{rotation}} state (spin period and obliquity) {{of a small}} body (e.g. asteroid) in heliocentric orbit due to the scattering of solar radiation off {{the surface of the}} body and emission of the body's own thermal radiation. The YORP effect is responsible for the creation of binary and tumbling asteroids as well as changing asteroid spin obliquities towards 0°, 90°, or 180° relative to the Solar <b>System</b> <b>ecliptic</b> and so modifying their heliocentric radial drift rates due to the Yarkovsky effect.|$|R

It is possible that the bow shock is smooth only in the northern hemisphere, since the southern surface is characterized by local magnetic anomalies. Its real shape can only be revealed in a 3 D representation in the planetary centered solar <b>ecliptic</b> coordinate <b>system</b> and questions the theoretically expected variation of the bow shock...|$|R
