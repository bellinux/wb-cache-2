5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he is better suited as a platoon player. <b>He</b> <b>hits</b> for power, but strikes out frequently. He is a good athlete, with good speed, but does not steal many bases. Defensively, he is adequate, and possesses a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford. His father, John Mayberry, Sr., played {{in the major leagues}} for over a decade and was a two-time All Star.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and sick children. More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run <b>he</b> <b>hits.</b> Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom Waddle, a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E
5000|$|He {{played for}} the Providence Grays from 1909 to 1911. In 1909, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]223 in 84 games. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]236 in 95 games in 1910 and in 1911 <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]226 in 27 games.|$|R

In the 2008 Olympics {{qualifier}} (held in 2006), <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]471 with 11 runs, although his team {{did not make}} the cut in the end. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]261 in the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games.

5|$|Chris befriends Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and {{she asks}} him to father her child, to which Chris replies {{that he needs}} time to decide. Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to go a picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
5|$|Later, Danny {{begins to}} date Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), the fun-loving niece of Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira). Gabrielle and Carlos overhear Angie and Nick {{fighting}} about their secret, which prompts {{them to send}} Ana to a modeling academy in New York for her safety. Danny follows Ana without his parents' knowledge. Angie and Gabrielle travel to New York to bring Danny home and Angie confesses her past to Gabrielle in confidence. Patrick tracks Angie back to Fairview, where <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> Nick with his car. While Nick is in the hospital, Patrick moves into the Bolen home and takes Angie and Danny hostage and forces Angie to build him a second bomb. He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a detonator from down the street. However, the bomb {{in the house was}} a decoy; Angie had planted the actual bomb in the detonator. Patrick dies in the explosion and Angie and Nick, still on the run from the FBI, relocate to Atlanta, Georgia while Danny moves to New York to be closer to his grandmother and Ana.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993 with Oklahoma, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]323 with 23 stolen bases. In 1994 with them, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]339 with 27 stolen bases.|$|R

25|$|The film The Party, {{starring}} Peter Sellers, {{includes a}} reproduction of the statue in the house's extended water feature. The statue's peeing can be changed at an extended intercom panel, and Sellers, as Hrundi V. Bakshi, soaks a guest when <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> the wrong button.|$|E
25|$|In Douglass Wallop's 1954 novel The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant (which {{inspired}} the Broadway musical Damn Yankees), Joe Hardy makes his debut for the Washington Senators team during a doubleheader at Tiger Stadium, hitting a game-winning {{home run in}} each game. During batting practice <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> one ball over the right field roof.|$|E
25|$|Vera {{falls in}} love with Nick Brent but when she meets his son Tony (Patrick Ward), she discovers he led the bikie gang that raped her. Tony {{recognises}} Vera and tries to kill her by running her over at Dorrie and Herb's party (a fancy dress celebration). <b>He</b> <b>hits</b> Simon instead, and when he makes another run at Vera, he ploughs into a brick wall and the car explodes.|$|E
5000|$|He {{played one}} more season of United States {{professional}} baseball, with the Saints of the Northern League in 1997. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]288 in 21 games. Overall, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]255 with one home run and 28 RBI in 108 big league games. In the minors, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]294 in nine seasons.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]225 in , {{this time}} as the White Sox {{starting}} catcher. In 75 games, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> three home runs with 23 RBI.|$|R

He retired from professional baseball after 1942, at age 43.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} display is the behavior of breaking branches, which {{all members of the}} group carry out. Even infants break small branches (or twigs), letting them fall to the soil, but the most spectacular is the alpha male who chooses large, dry branches which <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> with his hands and feet in spectacular jumps, so that they fall. Usually such branches make a tremendous sound as they fall through the other branches, {{and the members of the}} group become very excited and chatter loudly. This behavior is quite commonly discharged towards an observer when the animals have lost their fear.|$|E
25|$|Pennies, healing potions, antidotes and, often, quest {{items and}} weapon {{upgrades}} {{can be found}} in chests throughout the game. Often, chests will simply open when Bilbo touches them, but sometimes, the chests are locked, and Bilbo must pick the lock. This involves a timed minigame in which the player must align a pointer or select a specific target. Some chests will have only one minigame to complete, but chests containing more important items will have more, up to a maximum of eight. If Bilbo misses the pointer/target, the timer will jump forward; if <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> a red pointer or target, the minigame will end immediately. Penalties for failing to open a chest include losing health points or being poisoned. If the player has a skeleton key, they can bypass the minigames and open the chest immediately.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>hits</b> many sixes {{long and}} high, favouring {{straight}} down the ground or over midwicket. His trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and {{he is one of}} the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 7,000 ODI runs at an average under 25. Afridi is the only player in the world who has scored 1,000 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 format of the game. Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, he prefers to open the batting; however, elsewhere he prefers to bat at number six.|$|E
5000|$|He {{assumed a}} utility role upon joining the Marines {{and was used}} infrequently. In his first year with the club, he was hitless in two at-bats. In 2000, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]200 with a home run in 10 at-bats and in 2001, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]263 in 19 at-bats. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]176 with three home runs and eight RBI in 68 at-bats in 2002 and in 2003, his final season, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]279 with two home runs and nine RBI in 61 at-bats.|$|R
5000|$|Purchased by the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks on December 1, 2000, Valdés {{would play}} in Japan {{for the next}} four seasons.

In 2003, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]311 with 26 home runs and 104 RBI, and in 2004 <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]279 with 18 home runs and 74 RBI.|$|R
5000|$|Graham {{returned}} to the New York State League, appearing with the Scranton Miners {{for the rest of}} the season and in 1906. For the 1905 minor league season, playing for two teams, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]288 in 64 games. The following season, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> a career-best [...]329, split between two teams: Scranton, where <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]336 in 124 games; and the Memphis Egyptians of the Class A Southern Association, where <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]262 in a dozen games. He {{returned to}} Scranton for the 1907 and 1908 seasons, where <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]285 and [...]263 in 131 and 130 games, respectively. Graham ranked second in batting average for the New York State League, losing the 1906 batting title by four points.|$|R
25|$|Ian puts Bobby in {{a private}} school, hoping that it will help with his anger problems. However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his {{restaurant}} to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest. Ian eventually decides not to sell, meaning Bobby must leave the school, {{even though he is}} happy there and doing well. Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy, within earshot of everyone in the pub. After Bobby is questioned about the assault, he confesses to the police that he killed Lucy. They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon.|$|E
25|$|They {{discover}} it {{on a nearby}} moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> her with bolts of energy from his hands and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his old self, apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the Defiant are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole is gone and all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says {{that he was able}} to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long enough to say goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth. He departs with his son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), leaving Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in charge of DS9.|$|E
25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move in and out of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{his major}} league career was only that {{one cup of}} coffee, his {{professional}} career lasted for many more years. In 1915, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]268 in 138 games for the Birmingham Barons. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> [...]264 in 96 games for them in 1916, and in 1917 <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> [...]255 in 155 games for them.
