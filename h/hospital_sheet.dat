40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of laundry {{procedures}} on fabric-associated bacteria, a standard method of enumeration is needed. We evaluated six methods for enumeration of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus seeded (10 (2) and 10 (5) CFU/ 100 cm 2 of fabric area) onto sterilized <b>hospital</b> <b>sheets</b> and terry. Two methods involved maceration of seeded swatches in broth followed by passage of the broth through a 0. 45 -micron-pore-size, 47 -mm-diameter filter membrane. Three methods involved agitation of seeded swatches in broth with a paint shaker and membrane filtration of the broth to recover eluted bacterial cells, and the final method involved direct enumeration of cells on fabrics by overlaying seeded swatches with agar containing triphenyltetrazolium chloride as an indicator. The most convenient recovery method employed a 90 -s agitation followed by serial dilution of broths and membrane filtration. This method provided 44 / 57 % (low seed/high seed) recovery of E. coli from sheets and 133 / 31 % from terry and 34 / 74 % recovery of S. aureus from sheets and 58 / 57 % from terry. Although maceration provided similar recovery of E. coli and S. aureus, it is a less-practical method. The direct enumeration method was ineffective for enumerating gram-positive bacteria. We conclude that either the agitation or maceration method used enumerated the seeded bacteria to within 1 log 10 of their expected number {{and can be used}} to assess the bactericidal effectiveness of various steps in the laundering process...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{documented}} {{an association}} between thrombosis and ABO blood groups.

We sought to investigate, in a large sample of hospital admissions, the possible association between blood groups and VTE. The study was based on the discharge <b>hospital</b> <b>sheets</b> (DSOs) of patients admitted to the Hospital of Ferrara, region Emilia-Romagna (RER), Italy, 2000 and 2011. We selected all patients with first or second discharge ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis code of: acute pulmonary heart disease (APHD); pulmonary embolism (PE); phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (PVT); other venous embolism and thrombosis (OVET). Total population was divided into subgroups by gender, age, and presence of risk factors: arterial hypertension, diabetes, overweight-obesity, dyslipidemia, homocystinemia, coagulation defects, gout, and cancer. Moreover, we considered all patients in whom a blood group determination was recorded. There were 345, 607 admissions, regarding 164, 438 different patients. Of these, 65, 402 had their blood group determination. Among these patients, 1, 270 had a PE, 828 had a PVT, and 923 had an OVET. In the multivariate analysis, patients with non O blood group, and with A-allele, had a significantly higher risk for VTE (p= 0. 001) whereas the presence of group O appeared to be protective (p= 0. 001). This study shows an increased VTE risk in subjects with non O-groups genotypes, ranging from 20 % to 35 %. In the real world of everyday medical practice, the decision of whether to test for thrombophilia patients with VTE is controversial, due to organizational and economic constraints. Given the social utility of having one’s own blood group determination, and considering the prevalence of non-O blood groups, this could provide general practioners a valid, and relatively inexpensive, first-line tool to evaluate thrombophilic risk...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the cost of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Teaching University Hospital of Thessaly (TUHT) in 2006 and to demonstrate discrepancies between actual hospitalisation cost and social funds' reimbursement. Methods: Cost analysis was performed using a macro-costing approach, which focused on the estimation of nominal and actual cost per ICU patient. Data were derived from the annual records of resources consumed in each hospital unit and from <b>hospital</b> balance <b>sheets.</b> Sensitivity analysis was also performed by inflating nominal costs to present values. Results: There were 312 patients admitted to the ICU. Mean actual cost per ICU patient was estimated at € 16, 516, whereas actual reimbursement from social funds was only € 1, 671. This means that reimbursement accounted for just 10 of the actual hospitalisation cost. Once nominal costs were inflated to present values, the reimbursement accounted for 25 of the actual hospitalisation cost. The major cost drivers of ICU hospitalisation were personnel costs followed by infrastructure, hotel services and pharmaceutical expenditure. These results may be limited {{by a lack of}} consideration for clinical outcomes along {{with a high level of}} aggregation in cost data. Conclusion: Reimbursement should be re-adjusted in order to balance public hospital deficits and make public-private mix viable.

40|$|Background: {{dealing with}} the {{increased}} costs related to the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} chronic-degenerative diseases requires a better knowledge of patients’ true care pathways. The study objective was to explore, using multi-state modeling, how analyses of drug prescriptions and data obtained from <b>hospital</b> discharge <b>sheets</b> can be used in combination to build a model of patients’ health care pathways in a non experimental setting. The model was applied to chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease (coPd). MeThods: Based on the goLd guidelines, access to hospitalization for coPd and prescription pharmaceuticals were awarded to seven transient, theoretically progressive states. The intensity of transitions was estimated with the non-parametric method proposed by aalen and Johansen for multi-state Markov models, non-homogeneous in time. resuLTs: The coPd patients included in the study totaled 111190. Patients admitted with a diagnosis of coPd without exacerbation had a growing probability over time of needing prescriptions for inhaled corticosteroids (Ics) or the set combination of long-acting beta-agonists (LaBa) and Ics; they also had a rising probability of an exacerbation. The use of Ics alone or in combination with LaBa delays hospital admission for acute respiratory failure by about 6 months, as compared to short-acting beta-agonists or anticholinergics. concLusIon: The probabilities of a transition and their distribution in relation to time, sex, age and clinical status can be a helpful tool to guide those operating in the health care sector who are called upon to carry out decisions from the standpoints of both efficacious clinical management and an efficient use of resources...|$|R

Primary data were collected from four diverse Australian breast cancer treatment centres over a 12 -month period. The design was a multicentre demonstration project. Information about the provision of care and patient needs was collected through prospective logs. Structured interviews were conducted with women who received the SBN intervention (N = 167) and with a control group of women treated prior to the intervention period (N = 133). Health professionals (N = 47) were interviewed about their experience of the SBN. Almost all women had contact with an SBN at five scheduled consultations and 67 % of women in the intervention group requested at least one additional consultation with the SBN. Women in the intervention group were more likely to receive <b>hospital</b> fact <b>sheets</b> and to be told about and participate in clinical trials. Ninety-eight per cent of women reported that the availability of an SBN would affect their choice of hospital, with 48 % indicating that they would recommend only a hospital with a SBN available.

40|$|A slip-and-fall {{assessment}} score sheet {{is filled}} {{out by a}} nurse for all inpatients to recognize which of them {{are more likely to}} fall, and assist them. Although the sheet is used daily in a mixed medical ward (Departments of Internal Medicine, Otorhinolaryngology, and General Medicine) in Nara Medical University <b>Hospital,</b> the <b>sheet</b> was originally established based on slip-and-fall cases that had arisen in a department of neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery. So we wondered, whether the sheet would also work effectively in a mixed medical ward that manages a greater variety of medical treatments and disease situations. Therefore, in this study, we gathered the slip-and-fall incident reports (77 persons) and clarified the characteristics and actual condition of the inpatients who had fallen. And we compared the scores obtained by the inpatients who had fallen (78 persons) and the inpatients who had not fallen (178 persons) for each item, and found the items that showed {{a significant difference in the}} averaged scores between these groups of inpatients. Following the results, we calculated odds ratios by multiple logistic regression using only the items with the significant differences, and improved the scoring system to suit the mixed medical ward. The actual condition survey established the fact that the inpatients have often fallen in their own room during the night. Inpatients with a previous history of falling, aged inpatients, and inpatients with physical pain were especially likely to fall, because the scores obtained by the inpatients who had fallen were significantly higher than those of the inpatients who had not fallen in the items that related to falling history, age, and pain. The proposed scoring system could make the difference in the scores obtained by inpatients who have fallen and those who have not broader, making it possible to detect the inpatients who might fall with higher accuracy in a mixed medical ward...|$|R

Development of a surveillance system to track CO poisoning is a recommended public health activity. Initial steps to develop such a system are discussed. Methods: Michigan <b>hospitals</b> provided face <b>sheets</b> and discharge summaries of hospitalized and emergency department visits for CO poisonings. Reports were divided into three categories; intentional poisoning, non-work-related poisoning, and work related poisoning. The characteristics of the three groups, including demographics, sources of exposure, carboxyhemoglobin levels, and time of year were described. Results: There were 847 cases of CO poisoning reported. Another 312 cases were estimated to have been diagnosed and to have required treatment in the emergency department but were not reported.

40|$|In 2015, 96. 7 {{million tonnes}} {{of textile fibres}} were {{produced}} world-wide. Our high consumption of textiles leads to an increased amount of textile waste. In Sweden, the majority of used clothing and textiles are incinerated {{due to the lack}} of recycling techniques. A large amount of post-consumer textile waste is made from blended materials. One of the most common blends, used in as near as all workwear and service textiles, is cotton/polyester. To enable chemical recycling of such textiles, cotton and polyester must first be separated. The aim of this thesis was to separate the materials by depolymerizing the polyester using alkaline hydrolysis. The focus of the work was on how such a process should be performed without a catalyst, in order to result in both a high yield and a high purity of the cotton residue. In order to recycle the residue as a raw material for manufacturing of man-made cellulosic fibres, the cellulose chains in the cotton must also be maintained as unaffected as possible. The polyester in new sheets was completely depolymerized after 390 min at a temperature of 90 ºC using a 10 % sodium hydroxide concentration and a 1 % material-to-liquor concentration. The separation using these conditions gave high yields (above 96 %) of the cotton residue regardless of the material fineness used in the process. Furthermore, the separation performed on old sheets show that a pure cotton residue could be produced using higher material concentrations. It was shown that the cotton residue from old sheets, laundered around 50 times, had an intrinsic viscosity comparable to dissolving pulps used for viscose fibre spinning. This study concludes that alkaline hydrolysis without the use of a catalyst could be used to separate cotton and polyester in blended textiles. Furthermore, the findings show that cotton percentage in old sheets only decreased slightly after 50 launderings. Characterization of the materials using ATR FTIR spectroscopy indicate that an integrated textile recycling of <b>hospital</b> bed <b>sheets</b> could be performed since the sheets only contain cotton and polyester in all parts of the sheets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the relative frequency of deaths from coronary artery disease and from congestive cardiac failure associated with or secondary to chronic lung disease in 367 men with pneumoconiosis. All these men had been receiving a pension for pneumoconiosis and had died in the area served by the Birmingham Pneumoconiosis Medical Panel during 1967 and 1968. Of the total, 76 died from coronary artery disease and 107 from congestive cardiac failure. Thirty-one men had simple pneumoconiosis alone, and of these 87 % died from coronary artery disease and 13 % from congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-one men had progressive massive fibrosis, and of these 10 % died from coronary artery disease and 90 % from congestive cardiac failure. Ninety-one men had simple pneumoconiosis with bronchitis and emphysema and in this group death occurred in approximately equal numbers from both causes. It is suggested that the reason for these differences is the variation in the degree of hypoxia present in the different conditions. MATERIAL The series consists of 367 men who received a pension for pneumoooniosis and who died in the area served by the Birmingham Pneumoconiosis Medical Panel during 1967 and 1968.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} long-term results {{associated with}} an coordinated plan of care for acutely burned hands in children. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Optimal hand function is a crucial component of a high-quality survival after burn injury. This can be achieved only with a coordinated approach to the injuries. Long-term outcomes associated with such a plan of care have not been previously reported. METHODS: Over a 10 -year period, 495 children with 698 acutely burned hands were managed at a regional pediatric burn facility; 219 children with 395 injured hands were followed in the authors' outpatient clinic for at least 1 year and an average of > 5 years. The authors' approach to the acutely burned hand emphasizes ranging and splinting throughout the <b>hospital</b> stay, prompt <b>sheet</b> autograft wound closure as soon as practical, and the selective use of axial pin fixation and flaps.

It is a retrospective epidemiological study that includes all patients presenting with ocular injuries to the Mansoura Ophthalmic Center (Mansoura College) throughout the period from January 2012 to June 2015. Within this study, we examined retrospectively 1134 patients presenting with eye injuries. Patient’s collected data included age, sex, address, occupation, duration of presentation, reason for trauma, site to trauma, and kind of injuries. The reason for injuries was differentiated into blunt or sharp. Based on the site of eye injuries, the data were classified into three groups: work-related injuries, home-related injuries, and street-related injuries. The examination sheet for the hurt eye was acquired, and information was recorded based on the standardized classification of ocular trauma. Results The study incorporated 1134 patients presenting with eye injuries within a period of 3. 5 years (from January 2012 to June 2015). Most instances (80. 4 %) of ocular trauma occurred in male patients, who had an average chronological age of 25 years (varying from 1 to 80 years). Factory employees represent 36. 2 % of the total injury cases. Farmers represented 2. 5 % of hurt individuals. Students represented 18. 5 % of hurt individuals. Motorists constituted 1. 4 %. Housewives constituted 7. 2 % of injury cases. Individuals without any jobs constituted 34. 2 % of cases. Within this study, there was no delay in presentation to the hospital in 788 (69. 5 %) cases. However, 268 (23. 6 %) patients demonstrated delay greater than 24 [*]h to 1 week, and 78 (6. 9 %) patients demonstrated delay in excess of 7 days. Workplace injuries constituted 36. 7 % of cases, road-related injuries 31. 9 % of cases, and home injuries 31. 4 % of cases. Blunt objects represented 36. 3 % of eye injury cases. Sharp objects represented 63. 7 % of eye injury cases. There have been 852 (75. 1 %) closed-globe injuries and 282 (24. 9 %) open-globe injuries. Conclusion In Egypt, ocular trauma is an issue, as it is a significant reason for blindness. This research was targeted at determining factors that are characteristics of ocular trauma, so that they can aid in reducing its prevalence in Egypt...|$|R
40|$|Background: Trauma {{including}} {{accidents are}} today’s world concern forming a major non-communicable epidemic accounting for mortality and morbidity. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine and account the types of fractures and dislocations presented to Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences (BRIMS), Bidar, Karnataka, India. Methods and Material: This study is of retrospective in nature with a review of <b>hospital</b> inpatient case <b>sheets</b> of orthopaedic department in our hospital presented between July 2011 to Dec 2011. The data gathered was analysed by percentages. Results: Out of 132 cases analysed males (82. 56 %), outnumbered female (17. 42 %); 67. 42 % of cases were between 18 - 45 years age group; femur (22. 17 %) was the most commonly involved bone followed by tibia (13. 21 %), foot (10. 85 %); tibia & fibular (8. 96 %) involvement. Less common were spine (0. 47 %), vertebra (0. 94 %) and scapula (0. 94 %). Fracture-dislocation was more common in lower limb (59. 91 % – ankle joint was most common- 50 %) compared to upper limb (30. 66 %- shoulder joint: 12. 5 %). Conclusions: Among of 132 cases admitted 212 fractures & dislocation was noted. Male (82. 56 %) was more common than females (17. 42 %). Age group most commonly involved was between 18 - 45 years (67. 42 %). Fracture was more common in femur (22. 17 %) & dislocation was common in hip (42. 86 %) because of high velocity injury. Approach towards the prevention of accidents by effective safety education, good roads and early intervention which is the need of the hour. Effective drugs should be made available in the casuality so that crush injuries are managed without complications like septicemia and tetanus...|$|R
40|$|The Sonochemistry Centre at Coventry University {{is one of}} a {{group of}} organisations working on a project to develop a new {{technology}} for producing antimicrobial textiles. This technology involves the use of an ultrasonic process (sonochemical) to generate and impregnate fabrics with antibacterial metal oxide nanoparticles. The expectation is that these textiles can be produced at an affordable price for routine use in hospitals as uniforms, curtains, <b>hospital</b> bed <b>sheets</b> and linen. The aim of this PhD project was to assess the antibacterial activity of fabrics impregnated with ZnO and CuO NPs against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The testing was principally carried out according to the absorption method from ISO 20743 : 2007. Research was also extended to compare different methods of assessing antibacterial activity of textile fabrics. These included disc diffusion tests and shake flask tests in saline or nutrient broth. Overall the results from absorption tests demonstrated that both the ZnO and CuO impregnated fabrics showed very good levels of antibacterial activity (A> 2) against the test bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). During the optimisation of lab scale process to the pilot scale, two different types of CuO fabrics were produced to test and compare the antibacterial activity. One type of fabrics were impregnated with pre-made CuO nanoparticles by a ‘throwing the stones’ technology termed TTS and the other with sonochemically formed nanoparticles (in-situ), same as the lab process. The results indicated that the fabrics impregnated with sonochemically formed NPs displayed better antibacterial activity than the pre-made NPs. Leaching of the antibacterial agents in to saline was investigated using a shake flask method. CuO and ZnO coated fabrics prepared at laboratory scale were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. It was found that leachates prepared by shaking the fabrics in saline for 3 hours showed no antibacterial activity for CuO fabrics. However, leachates from ZnO fabrics showed an excellent activity after 24 ± 3 hours against all three bacterial species. Flow cytometry (FC) was investigated as an alternative to standard agar plate count (PC) methods for the determination of viable cell numbers. There was a general agreement between the results from agar plate counts and flow cytometry except that post incubation counts were greater with FC. The higher numbers of viable cells detected with FC may have been due to the presence of viable but not culturable cells (VBNC). Viable cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy in post incubation samples in which no viable cells were detected on nutrient agar plates. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted on ZnO and CuO fabrics from the pilot scale (both in-situ and TTS) against human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) using a MTT assay to determine cell viability. The results showed that ZnO and CuO are not toxic to HDF cells. However, cytotoxicity was seen in HepG 2 cells with cell viability decreasing by > 14 % for all the fabrics after 24 hours...|$|R
