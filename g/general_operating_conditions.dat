The TSB noted that most railway special instructions specify the minimum number of hand brakes needed in <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> but not always for specific conditions. It is often left up to the operating employee to determine the number of hand brakes to apply. The employee must take into consideration the slope or grade of the track and the approximate tonnage of the equipment to be secured at a specific location. The TSB also noted that the effectiveness of the hand brake system varied from car to car depending on the design, condition and maintenance, and also from one operator to another due to differences in physical capability and personal technique. The TSB also stated that it is inadequate for railway operators to depend on the push-pull test to verify whether the hand brakes can hold the cars.|$|E

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{aspect of}} surface and subsurface fatigue cracks propagation in hardened components subjected to rolling contact fatigue is highlighted, the former being greatly {{affected by the}} working conditions (in particular the presence of tangential stresses and lubricant), the latter depending mainly on the inclusions content and on the hardness profile. In order to determine which one {{of these kinds of}} damage is favoured, initial data consisting in contact load, rolling and sliding speed, rheological properties of the lubricant, material hardness and inclusions content are necessary. The concurrent role of asperities and Hertzian stress field in determining surface crack propagation is explained with the approach of the “quiescent zone”, calculating the stress intensity factors range in a contact cycle and considering the pumping effect of the fluid possibly present on the contact surface. Inherent defects (especially oxides) are thought to be responsible for subsurface cracks origin and the Murakami formula for short cracks is extrapolated to describe their growth threshold, which also depends on the hardness and therefore on the depth in surface hardened components. A crack propagation index is then defined as a ratio of applied to threshold stress intensity factor, both for surface and subsurface cracks. Evaluating this index for a <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> it is possible to determine which damage mechanism is favoured, taking into account the decisive effect of the hardness profile...|$|R

40|$|While EER (Exhaust Energy Recovery) {{has been}} widely pursued for {{improving}} the total efficiency and reducing CO emissions of internal combustion engines, the improvement on engine efficiency has been investigated with experimental work and numerical simulation based on a steam Rankine cycle EER system. The test was conducted on a light-duty gasoline engine connected with a multi-coil helical heat exchanger. Combining those experimental and modelling results, it demonstrates that the flow rate of working fluid plays a very important and complex role for controlling the steam outlet pressure and overheat degree. For achieving required overheat and steam pressure, the flow rate must be carefully regulated if the engine working condition changes. The flow rate has also significant influence on the heat exchanger efficiency. To achieving better heat transfer efficiency, the flow rate should be maintained as high as possible. From the simulation, it is found the EER system based on the light-duty test engine could increase the engine fuel conversion efficiency up to 14 %, though under <b>general</b> vehicle <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> it was just between 3 % and 8 %.

40|$|Profit and {{protection}} are two fundamental reasons {{to clean up}} waste gas streams. According {{to the nature of}} the contaminants and/or the complex mixture of pollutants in the gaseous phase, their concentrations and the flow to be cleaned, removing non-particulate pollutants from a gas stream is achieved by different processes classified into three categories: (i) thermal and/or catalytic oxidation, biological transformation; (ii) transfer into a liquid phase (absorption) or onto a solid phase (adsorption); and (iii) phase change (condensation). Bioprocesses, a relatively recent technology, appear to be a competitive way to treat the waste gas stream before its discharge to the atmosphere. The optimal range of pollutant concentration goes from a very diluted pollutant present in the gas stream (from some μg to mg m− 3) to above 1 g m− 3.

50|$|The {{classical}} {{definition of}} naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.Susceptibility consists {{of all the}} factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in <b>general</b> are the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> the threat, and {{the features of the}} ship itself. The <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavilyaffected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the problem of {{optimizing}} the aggregate throughput of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) employing the basic access mechanism at the data link layer of IEEE 802. 11 protocols. In order to broaden the applicability of the proposed analysis, we consider <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> accounting for both non-saturated and saturated traffic in the presence of transmission channel errors, as exemplified by the packet error rate P_e. The main clue of this work stems from the relation that links the aggregate throughput of the network to the packet rate λ of the contending stations. In particular, we show that the aggregate throughput S(λ) presents two clearly distinct operating regions that depend on the actual value of the packet rate λ with respect to a critical value λ_c, theoretically derived in this work. The behavior of S(λ) paves the way to a cross-layer optimization algorithm, which proved to be effective for maximizing the aggregate throughput in a variety of network operating conditions. A nice consequence of the proposed optimization framework relies {{on the fact that the}} aggregate throughput can be predicted quite accurately with a simple, yet effective, closed-form expression, which is also derived in the article. Finally, theoretical and simulation results are presented throughout the work in order to unveil, as well as verify, the key ideas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine {{possible}} waste heat recovery methods in data centers. Predictions indicate {{that in the next}} decade data center racks may dissipate 70 kW of heat, up from the current levels of 10 - 15 kW. Due to this increase, solutions must be found to increase the efficiency of data center cooling. This thesis will examine possible waste heat recovery technologies which will improve energy efficiency. Possible approaches include phase change materials, thermoelectrics, thermomagnetics, vapor compression cycles, absorbtion and adsorbtion systems. After a thorough evaluation of the possible waste heat engines, the use of an ejector heat pump was evaluated in detail. The principle behind an ejector heat pump is very similar to a vapor compression cycle. However, the compressor is replaced with a pump, boiler and an ejector. These three components require less moving parts and are more cost effective then a comparable compressor, despite a lower efficiency. This system will be examined under <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in a data center. The heat load is around 15 - 20 kW and air temperatures near 85 °C. A parametric study is conducted to determine the viability and cost effectiveness of this system in the data center. Included will be various environmentally friendly working fluids that satisfy the low temperature ranges found in a data center. It is determined that Ammonia presents the best option as a working fluid for this application. Using this system a Coefficient Of Performance of 1. 538 at 50 °C can be realized.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1977 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaOperational and {{deployment}} {{considerations are}} described {{to enhance the}} performance of jam resistant communications. The potential different ground propagation characteristics of spread spectrum and CW type waveforms are used {{to the advantage of}} the communication system. Emphasis is placed on the use of tactical relay to continuously optimize against the jammer. Tactics such as spoofing are described as a technique in confusing the intelligent jammer. The objective {{of this paper is to}} illustrate how anti-jam communications with nominal AJ performance improvement can effectively be employed in a ground environment. These include the brute force and the so-called intelligent or sophisticated jammer. For many years the utilization of anti-jam communications has been stifled in anticipation or the optimum solution against the optimum jammer. When evaluating a "one on one" scenario where the jammer is dedicated to jamming a specific link there is an unending subset of tradeoffs of optimum techniques to consider. However, when the jammer is trying to disrupt communications along a broad geographical axes. the techniques of jamming and communicating should be based on more <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ground communications environment in the presence of ground-based jamming presents the greatest opportunity for improving performance as a function of propagation anomalies and the use of relay. Airborne terminals within line of sight of the jammer have the most severe jamming environment. Ground based terminals generally will have an advantage of terrain against the ground based jammer. Those links that exhibit poor communications margin should always have the option of an alternate route in a jamming environment. The alternative to an alternate route is to provide excessive performance margins for worst case analysis. Unfortunately there is a significant cost factor associated with this latter approach. An important element of the scenario is the concept of position location. The use of position location and reporting equipment enables the apriori determination of appropriate links by different classes of users. As an example an aircraft can maneuver close to a ground terminal for communications to utilize the advantage of range ratio. This can be done in the worst case of a close Air Support Mission where the FO must provide voice or digital data to direct a strike at several mobile targets. At high altitudes the AC may be jammed but at low altitude the link may be viable. At low altitudes the aircraft A-G link will be constrained to a small geographic area and must therefore know which area to cover. The use of GPS can also be enhanced at low altitudes against the ground based jammer if acquisition of the GPS signal can be speeded up. The use of a digital matched filter (DMF) for CA code acquisition can provide this capability...|$|E

While new record efficiencies are frequently reported, the commercial application of this solar cell technology remains hindered by issues related to thermal and operational stability. Different mechanisms that are still debated modify cell properties with time, temperature, illumination and <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> 4 In order to correlate applied voltage (V) and resulting current (I) to changes in active layer chemistry and structure on the nanometre scale, we performed both ex situ and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, involving (scanning) TEM (STEM) imaging, selected-area electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) milling, with exposure to air during transfer to the TEM minimised to < 5 minutes to reduce any degradation of MAPbI 3. First, the effects of exposure to air and electron beam irradiation were assessed in relation to FIB final thinning parameters. Once adequate sample preparation and observation conditions were identified, changes in morphology during cell characterisation were assessed ex situ by comparing lamellae extracted from as-manufactured and tested cells and then in situ by contacting FIB-prepared samples to a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) chip mounted in a TEM specimen holder 5 (Fig. 1 a). Cell manufacturing parameters led to iodine diffusion into the hole collector, with the width of this diffused layer remaining constant during I-V characterisation. Similarly to ex situ experiments, the MAPbI 3 /Spiro interface was observed to delaminate during in situ electrical measurements, resulting {{in the presence of a}} ~ 5 nm Pb-rich layer on the hole-transparent-layer side (Figs. 1 b-c). In addition, PbI 2 nanoparticles were observed to nucleate within the MAPbI 3 layer at the hole-collector interface and at the positions of structural defects (Figs. 1 b-d). Overall, the active MAPbI 3 layer was observed to be sensitive to sample preparation, exposure to air, observation conditions and I-V stimulus, resulting in the need for great care to deconvolute each effect. Different mechanisms that may all contribute to the decrease in efficiency of the cell were identified both ex situ and in situ, including ionic migration, PbI 2 formation and local delamination of interfaces...|$|E
40|$|Biogas, {{composed}} principally of methane, {{has limited}} use in energy generation {{due to the}} presence of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). Biogas cannot be burned directly in an engine as H 2 S present causes corrosion in the reaction chamber. There currently exist various technologies for the removal of H 2 S from a gas stream, but most are chemically based, expensive, and are limited in use. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine a biogas purification technique suitable for a small scale farm application; including using a technology inexpensive, efficient, robust and easy to operate. As such, biofiltration was investigated for H 2 S removal from biogas. Factors considered in the design of the biofiltration system included the source and conditioning of inoculum, type of packing material, and <b>general</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> including inlet gas flow rate and H 2 S loading rate to the biofilter. Activated sludge conditioned in A. ferrooxidans media was an effective inoculum source. This was tested for growth support compatibility with gravel packing material, to be used in the biofilter. The inoculated packing material was loaded into the biofilter initially during start-up and acclimatization. In this study, synthetic biogas (49. 9 %volCH 4, 49. 9 %volCO 2, 2000 ppmv H 2 S) mixed with air (totalling 4 %vol O 2) was added at 5 - 10 L/hr to a biofilter of 0. 4 L gravel packing inoculated with conditioned activated sludge. Baseline H 2 S removal studies in a non-inoculated biofilter were performed with anticipated operating conditions, including an inlet gas stream at 7. 5 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), resulting in 31 - 56 % H 2 S removal. A factorial test performed found that air content in the inlet gas stream was the significant factor affecting the removal of H 2 S in the non-inoculated biofilter. Operation of the biofilter with biogas was done for 61 days, including 41 days for start-up and acclimatization and 20 days of H 2 S loading tests. Start-up and acclimatization with biogas resulted in complete H 2 S removal after 2 days, with an average overall H 2 S removal of 98. 1 %± 2. 9 std deviation over 34 days. Loading tests performed on the system ranged 5 - 12. 4 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), with a loading rate of 27. 8 to 69. 5 gH 2 S/m 3 h of filter bed. Throughout this test the average H 2 S removal rate was 98. 9 %± 2. 1 std deviation over 20 days. Although complete H 2 S breakthrough studies were not performed, these results indicate that biofiltration is a promising technology for H 2 S removal from biogas in a small scale application...|$|E

40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{off-grid}} {{renewable energy}} systems (RES) vary significantly in different applications and locations. To describe RES and the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of their components {{it is useful}} to define categories of similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Categories can also be used for lifetime considerations of RES components, for making recommendations and for analysing the properties and performance of a RES and its components. Categories support system designers and an economic analysis. This paper describes the process and the results of creating RES categories of similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> for batteries. Categories are defined {{in such a way that}} batteries belonging to the same category are subjected to similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and a similar combination of stress factors. The results provide a comprehensive overview of battery <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in existing off-grid renewable energy systems.
