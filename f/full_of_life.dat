5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E

Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E

25|$|These {{types of}} {{paintings}} {{were far more}} demanding than the informal portraits upon which Anguissola had based her early reputation, as it took {{a tremendous amount of}} time and energy to render the many intricate designs of the fine fabrics and elaborate jewelry associated with royal subjects.

25|$|Originally the Kouros type {{represented}} the archaic-thought that nature expresses itself in ideal everlasting simple-forms {{which can be}} traced by the senses and depicted in a way of illusive-reality. Matter was not regarded lifeless but something <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> in an almost animistic belief. These ideas seem to go parallel with the natural- philosophical conceptions of Thales from Miletus who searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of the things and also believed that matter was alive (υλοζωϊσμός). This material character is paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of blooming life through unnaturally simplified forms.|$|E

He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E
