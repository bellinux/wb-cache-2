5|$|The {{fact that}} the station's output {{continued}} to fall, coupled with increased operating costs, such as <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> cleaning, led to Battersea's demise. On 17 March 1975, the A Station was closed after being in operation for 40 years. By this time the A Station was co-firing oil and its generating capacity had declined to 228MW.|$|E

Adsorption isotherms of the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> on coal were measured at 35 °C and up to a maximum pressure of 88 bar using the volumetric method. The <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> used were simulated industrial <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> of a coal fired plant.

40|$|Pilot scale {{experiments}} have demonstrated {{a method of}} reducing the amounts of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emitted by industrial boilers and powerplant combustors that involves (1) injection of H 2 O 2 into <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> and (2) treatment of the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> by caustic wet scrubbing like that commonly used to remove SO 2 from combustion <b>flue</b> <b>gases.</b> Heretofore, the method most commonly used for removing NOx from <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> has been selective catalytic reduction (SCR), in which the costs of both installation and operation are very high.

The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1973 and {{extended}} in the mid-1980s, {{the station was}} initially operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times, and it is operated by the Drax Group. Completed in 1986, it is the newest coal-fired power station in England, <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995; high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012. Because of its large size, the station is the UK's single largest emitter of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the proper}} and the {{optimized}} heat transfer from the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> to the boiler tubes draft holds {{a relatively high}} amount of significance. The combustion rate of the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> {{and the amount of}} heat transfer to the boiler are both dependent on the movement and motion of the <b>flue</b> <b>gases.</b> A boiler equipped with a combustion chamber which has a strong current of air (draft) through the fuel bed will increase the rate of combustion ( [...] which is the efficient utilization of fuel with minimum waste of unused fuel). The stronger movement will also increase the heat transfer rate from the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> to the boiler (which improves efficiency and circulation).|$|R

40|$|Mercury {{transformation}} {{mechanisms and}} speciation profiles are reviewed for mercury formed in and released from <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> of coal-fired boilers, non-ferrous metal smelters, cement plants, {{iron and steel}} plants, waste incinerators, biomass burning and so on. Mercury in coal, ores, and other raw materials is released to <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> {{in the form of}} Hg 0 during combustion or smelting in boilers, kilns or furnaces. Decreasing temperature from over 800 °C to below 300 °C in <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> leaving boilers, kilns or furnaces promotes homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of Hg 0 to gaseous divalent mercury (Hg 2 +), with a portion of Hg 2 + adsorbed onto fly ash to form particulate-bound mercury (Hg p). Halogen is the primary oxidizer for Hg 0 in <b>flue</b> <b>gases,</b> and active components (e. g., TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, etc.) on fly ash promote heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption processes. In addition to mercury removal, mercury transformation also occurs when passing through air pollution control devices (APCDs), affecting the mercury speciation in <b>flue</b> <b>gases.</b> In coal-fired power plants, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system promotes mercury oxidation by 34 – 85...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing black liquor dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat loss will decrease as the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> flow diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> flow.|$|E

25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} steam {{generator}} includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure.

25|$|As the {{combustion}} <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> pollution.
