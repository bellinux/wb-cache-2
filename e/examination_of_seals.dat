These sources are: (i) 17 post mortem <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> harp <b>seal</b> pups killed in 2007; (ii) videos supplied by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) showing 169 seals killed by over 20 different sealing boats during the hunts in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007; and (iii) an Expert Opinion Analysis where 133 experts were sent 30 randomly-selected timelines where each showed {{the sequence of events}} extracted from the videos for a single seal kill and asked "How do you rate the overall welfare of this animal during the processes which resulted in its death?". • Both the seal carcasses and the videos were a random sample and the data in this report provide a comprehensive overview of the pattern <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> undertaken across a broad spectrum of ice conditions and by different sealin...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} {{development and use of}} the imagery of the contest scene depicted on cylinder seals—glyptic art—produced during the Akkadian period in greater Mesopotamia. The kings of the Akkadian dynasty established the first empire of the ancient world {{during the second half of}} the third millennium BC. An important element of their imperialization strategy was the implementation of a complex administrative structure. Reconstructions of the economic management and organization of the state provide a useful context in which to examine glyptic art and in particular the relationship between the contest scene and sealing practice. ^ In chapter three, an analysis of the contest scene serves as a means to order the evidence by grouping the scenes into different types based on the compositional character of the design. An <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> practice identifies and describes different sealing types and considers possible associations between the compositional types of the contest scene and sealing practice. In addition, a broader discussion of the archaeological setting of Akkadian glyptic, organized by region, is presented in order to elucidate the chronological development of the contest scenes as well as to locate the glyptic in the larger cultural environment of the period. Subject matter other than the contest scene is discussed to a lesser extent since all glyptic imagery was part of an integrated system within the administrative context. Contact between northern and southern Mesopotamia brought on by Akkadian imperialization stimulated the development of new concerns and is one means to consider Akkadian glyptic imagery. ^ It is argued that the development of the contest scene was in part a response to the nature <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> practice which itself underwent a transformation during the Akkadian period. The requirements of managing goods and people over greater areas of land was one impetus for new modes of control and communication among the administrative elite which stimulated changes in <b>sealing</b> practices <b>of</b> the period. The inscribed Two Pair contest scene was the imagery developed to convey different and/or new kinds of information related to the new requirements <b>of</b> <b>sealing</b> as well as the overall administrative system. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{cementitious}} composites and materials, the <b>sealing</b> <b>of</b> fractures {{can occur in}} water by the precipitation of calcium compounds. In this study, the sealing behavior in a macro-fractured high-strength and ultra-low-permeability concrete (HSULPC) specimen was investigated in simulated seawater using micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (CT). In particular, the influence of fracture width (0. 10 and 0. 25 mm) on fracture sealing was investigated. Precipitation occurred mainly at the outermost parts of the fractured surface of the specimen for both fracture widths. While significant sealing was observed for the fracture width of 0. 10 mm, sealing was not attained for the fracture width of 0. 25 mm within the observation period (49 days). <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sealed</b> regions on the macro-fracture was performed using a three-dimensional image registration technique and applying image subtraction between the CT images of the HSULPC specimen before and after maintaining the specimen in simulated seawater.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the interpretive tradition of Mullā Ṣadrā {{in the context}} of the schools of Tehran and Qum. Mullā Ṣadrā’s transcendental philosophy (al-ḥikmah al-mutaʿālīyah or ḥikmat) avails itself to a number of readings; however, this thesis focuses on the philosophical and mystical (ʿirfānī) readings in terms of their development, transmission and their impact on how ḥikmat is understood in the modern Iranian seminary (ḥawza). The way in which a text is read in the ḥawza has great implications for the development of ideas, as the ḥawza uses a text based system to train students in a particular field. While both readings were studied by the majority of transcendental philosophers (ḥukamāʾ) in the school of Tehran, the school of Qum saw a greater separation between the readings and I show that for a number of reasons, including the introduction of seminal texts written by ʿAllāmah Ṭabāṭabāʾī, a preference developed for a more philosophical reading of transcendental philosophy. I examine evidence for the different preferences of the ḥukamāʾ for either a more philosophical or ʿirfānī reading of ḥikmat through an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> their writings on the subjects of existence (wujūd), guardianship (walāyah) and resurrection (maʿād) which act as case studies. The theoretical implications of both approaches are examined in each chapter as well as their interdependence. The schools of Tehran and Qum built on Mullā Ṣadrā’s framework and provided new interpretations of important issues. Apart from the intricate discussions on the core aspects of ḥikmat, Muḥammad Riżā Qumshihī’s masterful <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Seal</b> <b>of</b> the Saints and ʿAlī Mudarris Zunūzī’s philosophy of bodily resurrection are examples of a thriving interpretive tradition in Iran and constitute significant developments of important philosophical and ʿirfānī concepts from the ideas of their predecessors...|$|R
40|$|The use of Shale-Gouge-Ratio (SGR) {{methods to}} predict across-fault seal {{capacity}} {{relies on a}} calibration of the methodology against field examples. Existing calibrations have plotted across-fault pressure difference or buoyancy pressure against in situ SGR to define a fault-seal failure envelope. Recent work on hydrodynamics and seal capacity has provided insight on fine-tuning the calibration methodologies that should in turn lead to improved fault seal capacity predictions. A situation not fully addressed, however, {{is the impact of}} fault zone heterogeneity on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a fault and thus the membrane seal capacity. For a fault that defines a hydraulic head discontinuity at the reservoir scale, there exists a hydraulic head gradient or distribution within the fault-zone that is determined by the detailed permeability distribution within the fault zone. As a result, the capillary threshold pressure varies across the fault. When compared with the hydraulic head, the fault zone seal capacity can be estimated at various locations within the fault zone. Theoretical <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> membrane <b>seal</b> capacity for various permeability distributions can be used to understand parameters that control the location of the critical leak point for a membrane fault seal. This can also be extended to examine possible up-fault leakage. A range of permeability distributions are examined for a theoretical fault zone.

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{political}} and cultural status of the island of Cyprus as the only place within the Mediterranean where Christian heirs of Romans and Muslims shared the local tax revenue to create a buffer zone between two empires.

Instead, I propose, Cyprus and its cities were still active from late antiquity to the early middle ages, preserving a variable but still traceable degree of economic vitality (benefitting from the circulation of Byzantine and Arab coinage), which infers the maintenance of complex political, commercial and cultural relations (implicit in issues of imagery and prototypes of coins) between the Byzantine Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate...|$|R
40|$|The rotary {{lip seal}} {{is the most}} widely used dynamic seal. It is used {{extensively}} in the automotive and appliance industries. Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance <b>of</b> a lip <b>seal,</b> even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness. In the present study, several deterministic numerical models are developed to investigate the effect of shaft surface finish on rotary lip seal behavior, through an understanding of the basic physics <b>of</b> lip <b>seal</b> operation. This project is performed in a step by step manner with gradually increasing complexity. Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> some important <b>seal</b> characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, reverse pumping rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined. The results of the present deterministic modeling indicate that shaft surface roughness can produce significant desirable effects on lip seal behavior. An appropriate shaft surface profile could improve the sealing ability and prevent seal failure. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Richard F.
