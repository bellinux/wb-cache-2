25|$|Since as {{far back}} as the reign of King Louis XIV, the monarchs that reigned over colonies in New France, British North America, and present-day Canada have {{bestowed}} royal honours, decorations, and medals on those living under their sovereignty, in recognition of their services to the state. Early Governors of New France also desired to establish local honours in or import European honours to Canada; Samuel de Champlain, for instance, founded on 14 November 1606 the Order of <b>Good</b> <b>Cheer</b> (still extant today) and Charles de Montmagny had designs to establish the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in New France while he was governor from 1635 to 1648. The Ordre Royal et Militaire de Saint-Louis, established by King Louis XIV in 1693 specifically to honour worthy French, Catholic military officers, came to be one of the most familiar honours in New France; some 300 people associated with Canada were appointed into it, Louis-Hector de Callière being the first. Appointments into the order continued even after the transfer of New France to the British Crown in 1763.|$|E

The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said, [...] "His relentless <b>good</b> <b>cheer</b> would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet". Robert Thompson, a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, [...] "There is something kind of unique about [...] It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it".|$|E

500|$|The {{synopsis}} {{of the film}} was provided in Moving Picture News as: [...] "The action is laid {{in the latter part}} of the eighteenth century while the story revolves about a young Scotch duke who, determined not to marry one seeking his money, searches for adventure in the Highlands, disguised as a piper. He meets, during his wanderings, Madge, the daughter of Donald Maclvor. They fall in love at sight. Unaware of Shon's real identity, the old father refuses to sanction the match. He prefers to give his daughter to the wealthy Laird of the Isla. When the girl carries this news to her lover he tells her to [...] "Be of <b>good</b> <b>cheer,</b> my bonny lass; I'll pipe them a tune of another class." [...] The wedding day is fixed and the Laird leads his melancholy fiancee forth. Shon visits the feast in the garb of a harpist. He amuses the guests for a while and then, throwing off his disguise, escapes with Madge from a window. But previous to this, Shon has called his clan together and when speeding away to his mansion, they cover his retreat. What follows is a remarkably thrilling and fresh piece of business; a battle between two kilted Scotch clans. And then the title of the youth is discovered and all ends well." ...|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, {{and it has}} been noted for its appeal towards different age groups.

According to Laura Fries of Variety magazine, the series is [...] "a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and resilient sea sponge ... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today's animated TV shows, this is purely kid's stuff ... However, that's not to say that SpongeBob is simplistic or even juvenile. It's charming and whimsical, but clever enough to appeal to teens and college-aged kids, as well". The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said SpongeBob [...] "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. And it's also good, clean fun, which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge". Millman wrote, [...] "His relentless <b>good</b> <b>cheer</b> would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet".|$|E

2500|$|The Order of Good Cheers (French: L'Ordre de Bon Temps) was {{originally}} a French Colonial order founded by suggestion of Samuel de Champlain upon arrival in New France, present day Canada.

[...] A long prison sentence did not affect his inspiratory qualities.

He resisted with all his might not to escape death, but merely to show that nothing was over until it was over."

From time to time, the sagamo Membertou and its close relations were also invited to share the feast during which the person in charge of the eve entered ceremoniously in the main room of the Habitation wearing around his neck the collar of the Order that he would tend to the future host of the next evening. In the current rebuilt Habitation, today a national historical place of Canada, one can easily imagine the atmosphere of these evenings.
