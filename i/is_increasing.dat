For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E

Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30â€“50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand.

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
