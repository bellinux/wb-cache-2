Then he went forth, and Mr. Crawley followed him. There {{was the major}} standing in the road, and Toogood was anxious {{to be the first}} to communicate the good news. It was the only reward he had proposed to himself for the money he had expended and the time he had lost and the trouble he had taken. [...] "It's all right, old fellow," [...] he said, clapping his hand on Crawley's shoulder. [...] "We've got the right sow by the ear at last. We know all about it." [...] Mr. Crawley could hardly remember the time when he had been called an old <b>fellow</b> <b>last,</b> and now he did not like it; nor, in the confusion of his mind, could he understand the allusion to the right sow. He supposed that Mr. Toogood had come to him about his trial, but it did not occur to him that the lawyer might be bringing him news which might make the trial altogether unnecessary. [...] "If my eyes are not mistaken, there is my friend, Major Grantly," [...] said Mr. Crawley.|$|E
6000|$|Yesterday I {{was allowed}} to enter the prison with Mrs. Hammond. A Boer guard was at my elbow all the time, but was courteous and polite, only he barred {{the way in the}} {{compound}} (quadrangle or big open court) and wouldn't let me cross a white mark that was on the ground--the [...] "death-line" [...] one of the prisoners called it. Not in earnest, though, I think. I found that I had met Hammond once when he was a Yale senior and a guest of Gen. Franklin's. I also found that I had known Capt. Mein intimately 32 years ago. One of the English prisoners had heard me lecture in London 23 years ago. After being introduced in turn to all the prisoners, I {{was allowed to}} see some of the cells and examine their food, beds, etc. I was told in Johannesburg that Hammond's salary of $150,000 a year is not stopped, and that the salaries of some of the others are still continued. Hammond was looking very well indeed, and I can say the same of all the others. When the trouble first fell upon them it hit some of them very hard; several fell sick (Hammond among them), two or three had to be removed to the hospital, and one of the favorites lost his mind and killed himself, poor <b>fellow,</b> <b>last</b> week. His funeral, with a sorrowing following of 10,000, took the place of the public demonstration the Americans were getting up for me.|$|E

5000|$|Günter Platzek (18 July 1930 in Hanover, Germany [...] - [...] 29 November 1990 in Hamburg, Germany) was a German {{keyboard}} player. He {{became known}} for his longtime work with the James Last Orchestra, {{of which he was}} a member from 1965 up until his death. He was {{also a member of the}} NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk, or North German Radio) big band, the Alfred Hause tango orchestra and the Bert Kaempfert orchestra. An accomplished keyboard, accordion and xylophone player, he formed an accordion duet group called The Pop Kids with <b>fellow</b> <b>Last</b> bandmate Harald Ende. His work with James Last featured his unique improvised piano phrases, which drew on jazz, blues and rock influences and were played with a distinctively dry staccato tone. During the 1980s, his accordion duet with Jo Ment on the song [...] "Biscaya" [...] became a highlight of James Last's live concerts. He died in Hamburg from a heart attack on 29 November 1990.|$|E
50|$|Harald Ende (born February 15, 1929, Hamburg, Germany) is a German saxophone, flute and {{accordion}} {{player who}} {{was active in}} the Hamburg music scene from the 1950s to the 1990s. He attended the local music school and was trained as a classical clarinetist. However, upon graduating, he soon found that in order to get steady work, he had to play in a more popular context. In 1958, he joined the NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk, or North German Radio) big band. He also worked as a studio musician for many popular German recording acts like Bert Kaempfert. In 1968, he joined the James Last Orchestra, for which he {{had to learn how to}} play the flute; James Last himself taught Ende how to play the instrument. A big band musician enamoured with the work of Buddy Rich and Count Basie, Ende recorded and toured with Last until the end of 1979, after which he devoted most of his career to his work with the NDR big band, often backing up well-known jazz stars like Joe Pass and Chet Baker. One popular sideline act was his accordion duo with <b>fellow</b> <b>Last</b> and Kaempfert bandmate Günter Platzek, known as The Pop Kids. Now retired, Ende took part in the 80th anniversary celebration of the birth of Bert Kaempfert in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|The Pedlar of SwaffhamTradition {{says that}} there lived in former times in Soffham (Swaffham), alias Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain pedlar, who dreamed that if he went to London Bridge, and stood there, he should hear very joyfull news, which he at first slighted, but afterwards, his dream being doubled and trebled upon him, he {{resolved}} to try the issue of it, and accordingly went to London, {{and stood on the}} bridge there two or three days, looking about him, but heard nothing that might yield him any comfort. At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked any almes, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there, or what his business was; to which the pedlar honestly answered that he had dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge he should hear good newse; at which the shop-keeper laught heartily, asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand, adding: [...] "I'll tell thee, country <b>fellow,</b> <b>last</b> night I dreamed that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me, where methought behind a pedlar's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak tree, if I dug I should find a vast treasure! Now think you," [...] says he, [...] "that I am such a fool to take such a long journey upon me upon the instigation of a silly dream? No, no, I'm wiser. Therefore, good fellow, learn wit from me, and get you home, and mind your business." [...] The pedlar observing his words, what he had say'd he dream'd, and knowing they concentred in him, glad of such joyfull newse, went speedily home, and digged and found a prodigious great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich and Soffham (Church) being for the most part fallen down, he set on workmen and rectified it most sumptuously, at his own charges and to this day there is his statue therein, but in stone, with his pack at his back and his dogg at his heels and his memory is also preserved by the same form or picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, and alehouses of that town unto this day.|$|E

6000|$|This was {{no other}} than poor Jack Butts, who {{is a sort of}} small artist and picture-dealer by profession, and was a dayboy at Slaughter House when we were there, and very {{serviceable}} in bringing in sausages, pots of pickles, and other articles of merchandise, which we could not otherwise procure. The poor fellow has been employed, seemingly, in the same office of fetcher and carrier ever since; and occupied that post for Mrs. Berry. It was, [...] "Mr. Butts, have you finished that drawing for Lady Pash's album?" [...] and Butts produced it; and, [...] "Did you match the silk for me at Delille's?" [...] and there was the silk, bought, no doubt, with the poor <b>fellow's</b> <b>last</b> five francs; and, [...] "Did you go to the furniture-man in the Rue St. Jacques; and bring the canary-seed, and call about my shawl at that odious dawdling Madame Fichet's; and have you brought the guitar-strings?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So far as I {{could make}} out, Mr. Hilbrook's life hadn't {{filled up with}} other interests. He did not care for {{the events of the}} day, as far as I tried him on them, and he did not care for the past. I tempted him with autobiography; but he seemed quite {{indifferent}} to his own history, though he was not reticent about it. I proposed the history of his cousin in the boyish days which he said they had spent together; but he seemed no more interested in his cousin than in himself. Then I tried his dog and his pathetic sufferings, and I said something about the pity of the poor old <b>fellow's</b> <b>last</b> days being so miserable. That seemed to strike a gleam of interest from him, and he asked me if I thought animals might live again. And I found--I don't know just how to put it so as to give you the right sense of his psychological attitude." ...|$|R
