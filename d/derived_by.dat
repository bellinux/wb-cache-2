5|$|When {{nominals}} are <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> reduplication, {{the added}} meaning is usually one of plurality. However, since both a dual and a plural nominal suffix exist, -giwu and -guju respectively, nominal reduplication is rare.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Knox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting {{well over}} two hours. The {{services}} used a liturgy that was <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> Knox and other ministers from Calvin's Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques. The church {{in which he}} preached, the Église de Notre Dame la Neuve—now known as the Auditoire de Calvin—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, {{for the use of}} the English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.|$|E

5|$|Lettuce {{was first}} {{cultivated}} {{by the ancient}} Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name , from which the English lettuce is ultimately <b>derived.</b> <b>By</b> 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect can}} also be <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism. It {{is due to the}} {{influence}} of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations). Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} was a precise {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230.

5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|This {{and related}} {{predictions}} follow {{from the fact}} that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{synthesis}} of CMOS circuits, the function to be synthesized is represented as a formula in Boolean algebra. Then this formula is translated into two series-parallel multigraphs. These graphs {{can be interpreted as}} circuit diagrams in which the edges of the graphs represent transistors, gated by the inputs to the function. One circuit computes the function itself, and the other computes its complement. One of the two circuits is <b>derived</b> <b>by</b> converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into series and parallel compositions of graphs, respectively. The other circuit reverses this construction, converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into parallel and series compositions of graphs. These two circuits, augmented by an additional edge connecting the input of each circuit to its output, are planar dual graphs.|$|E
