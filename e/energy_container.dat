However Hal used his ring to speed up a clock, making Sinestro think his ring had run out of power. When he released Hal from the bubble to eliminate him, he was defeated and imprisoned in a green bubble by Hal, who did not take him back to his Universe as it would go against the jurisdiction of the Guardians. However he escaped using a ring that could drain the Green Lantern's ring-power and continued to menace Hal. He tried to attack the Guardians after trapping Green Lantern, before disguising himself as him so he could occupy a meeting of Green Lanterns and absorb power from their rings by casting an illusion of a monster so they used their rings. However Green Lantern escaped and defeated Sinestro on Oa, who was placed in a green <b>energy</b> <b>container</b> which would orbit the Universe by the power of many Green Lanterns. But he escaped with a power ring hidden in his boot. He was very adept at escaping the ways the guardians tried to imprison him.|$|E

50|$|The cosmological {{constant}} has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes {{the expansion of}} the universe to accelerate. The reason a {{cosmological constant}} has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume dV requires work done equal to a change of energy −P dV, where P is the pressure. But the amount of <b>energy</b> in a <b>container</b> full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ρV, where ρ is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, P is negative and, in fact, P = −ρ.|$|R

Using salt hydrate technology with a storage density of about 1 GJ/m3, 4-8 m3 could be sufficient.|$|R

The bouncing can be reduced by introducing a liquid into the ball; however, the first rebound remains largely unaffected by the fluid. Granular materials can also work as dampers.

During the collision, the kinetic <b>energy</b> of the <b>container</b> is partially transferred to the grains, the rebound is damped, and the fast energy dissipation through inter-particle collisions and friction decreases the bouncing time dramatically. For grain-filled cylinders, a completely inelastic collision (zero rebound) is obtained when mi≥ 1. 5 εomc, where εo and mc are the coefficient of restitution and mass of the empty container. For grain-filled spheres, the first rebound is almost undamped, but the second collision is completely inelastic if mi>>mc.

50|$|One {{example of}} an {{experimental}} storage system based on chemical reaction energy is the salt hydrate technology. The system uses the reaction energy created when salts are hydrated or dehydrated. It works by storing heat in a container containing 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Heat (e.g. from using a solar collector) is stored by evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction. When water is added again, heat is released in an exothermic reaction at 50 °C (120 °F). Current systems operate at 60% efficiency. The system is especially advantageous for seasonal thermal energy storage, because the dried salt can be stored {{at room temperature for}} prolonged times, without <b>energy</b> loss. The <b>containers</b> with the dehydrated salt can even be transported to a different location. The system has a higher energy density than heat stored in water and the capacity of the system can be designed to store energy from a few months to years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main {{obstacle}} to electrification in Africa is not constructing power stations and building overhead power lines. It is working {{out how to}} help the region's households acquire sustainable energy with limited and irregular cash flows, little collateral and no access to credit. They cannot {{afford to pay for}} the huge investment needed to bring electricity to them. Even if the electricity was brought to them, most can barely afford to pay for usage. This problem can only be addressed by providing tools that bring wealth to the communities. After water, food and shelter comes the need of lighting to extend the productive hours of the day. The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Johannesburg, in collaboration with ! Ecovest, a South African upcoming small scale enterprise, developed an innovative solar home lighting solution that can be manufactured off the grid in a community based container factory. Solar lighting is significant for many without electricity and the developed solution allows the Sun to pay to eradicate expensive unsustainable on-grid <b>energy.</b> The <b>container</b> based solution empowers the community to create jobs and generate wealth while producing affordable and durable products due to reduced distribution and marketing costs. In existing and emerging markets, the gross product cost includes the costs of distribution which is well developed in existing markets but poorly developed in the emerging African market.

They will then begin to attack them - and the gameplay is similar to Namco's older Galaxian games, except for the facts that two players can play simultaneously, some of the enemies shall leave powerups behind when killed, the players' ships cannot get captured and retrieved, and the Challenging Stages are a video simulation of the original Cosmo Gang: the players must endure twenty-four seconds without the Cosmo Gangers stealing one of their <b>energy</b> <b>containers</b> (their ships are also transformed to look like the original redemption machine's light-guns during these stages). In the two-player mode (which was the basis for Galaga Arrangement), lives are shared between players, so if one player is killed, it will indirectly kill the other one as well - and if either player had won the Armor shot powerup by killing a Bakuto (one of the sunglasses-wearing, ship-flying Cosmo Gangers), it will fly up into the air and the other player will have the chance to catch it before it falls off the bottom of the screen. And, as in Toy Pop (which was the only game Namco released in their last 8-bit year, 1986, that did not use a Yamaha YM2151), both players' scores are combined for the two-player mode; however, the points awarded for a Challenging Stage shall not get divided between them, and they will both receive the appropriate value. The [...] "P" [...] ("Point Up") powerups shall also increase the players' respective score multipliers (as indicated by the text [...] "X2" [...] in the screenshot above), up to a maximum of 16 - and if either player collects one after his or her score multiplier has reached 16, he or she will receive 7650 (Namco's goroawase number) x16 (122400) points instead (the multipliers are also reset after a Challenging Stage). The Rally-X Special Flag also reappears, as an [...] "extra life" [...] powerup (but on account of lives being shared between players in the two-player mode, it applies to both of them in that case), and the [...] "Change" [...] and [...] "Supernova" [...] powerups only appear in the two-player mode; the former swaps over both ships' [...] "2.5D" [...] positions {{at the bottom of the}} screen while the latter causes the secondary part of the YM2151-generated song to cut out (but the primary part of it continues) as the text [...] "SHOOT ME!" [...] appears on the left (or right) side of the ship whose [...] "2.5D" [...] position is on the top (Player 2 by default), and once the other player has fired enough shots at it, it will launch a hail of bullets up at the Cosmo Gangers. Both players can then repeat this process, until either one of them (or the last Cosmo Ganger on the stage) gets killed - and this game's final boss, Don Cosmo (who has four attack phases, one for each of his life bars) also wears an inverted cross (like the fourth boss of Splatterhouse) around his neck. At the end of this game, if either (or both) players were killed less than ten times (or not killed at all), they will receive a maximum of 10000000 points (it decreases by 1000000 for each time a player is killed); the end credits were also originally displayed only in Japanese, but in the US version, they have English text added below them. At the end of a two-player game, both players will also have to enter their initials on the high-score table together.|$|R
