500|$|Bobby Edner's {{portrayal}} of Vaan has been met with mostly positive reception. Cavin Smith praised his acting, stating that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an actual teenager without sounding whiny. Agustin praised the developers for giving Vaan a voice actor, commenting that it prevents any awkward silences from a silent protagonist. He added however that Vaan is [...] "decidedly quiet", owing {{to many of}} the conversations not requiring his input, which Agustin called a [...] "brilliant interactive storytelling device". His design change from Final Fantasy XII to Revenant Wings was criticized by RPGFan editor Patrick Gann, for going from a teenage design to {{what appears to be the}} design of a 10-year-old Vaan.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Cory Monteith's vocal {{performance}} in the episode was criticized by Joal Ryan of E! Online, who felt that [...] "Monteith was so Auto-Tuned <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Cher." ...|$|R
60|$|It was rotten. The poor nut had got {{stage fright}} {{so badly that}} it {{practically}} eliminated his voice. <b>He</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> some far-off echo of the past 'yodelling' through a woollen blanket.|$|R
5000|$|Baron Barracuda wore a monocle in one eye, {{and spoke}} in a vaguely European accent; <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a Bela Lugosi [...] "Dracula" [...] imitation.

500|$|However, Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music {{felt that}} the album lacked inspiration, and wrote, [...] "nothing sticks, there's no guts, no depth {{and no matter how}} much he protests to the contrary, nothing to believe". Rolling Stone Melissa Maerz {{perceived}} that Usher had put little effort into the record and stated that [...] "now that he's got the American Dream, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he's stopped trying." [...] Blender Josh Eells was let down by the large number of ballads and lack of sexual content. Clover Hope of The Village Voice described it as [...] "pure grown-man bidness" [...] and [...] "a little too sitting-on-the-dock-of-the-bay for Chris Breezy–trained earbuds". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine scored Here I Stand two-and-a-half stars out of five, and considered the music [...] "almost always just one notch above mediocrity." [...] The Observer Steve Yates panned the album as [...] "gloop [...] wades through". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau cited the songs [...] "Trading Places" [...] and [...] "Best Thing" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating [...] "good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "tension, not bliss, creates the album's best songs", referring to [...] "Moving Mountains", [...] "His Mistakes", [...] "Appetite" [...] and [...] "What's a Man To Do". At the 51st Grammy Awards, the album's title track was nominated for the Best Male R Vocal Performance award, but lost to Ne-Yo's [...] "Miss Independent" [...] from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman.|$|E

5000|$|The Wendigo first {{appeared}} in The Incredible Hulk #162 (April 1973), and was created by Steve Englehart and Herb Trimpe.

2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you. Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he has just started ... As Adam strips down to semi nakedness during the filthy Physical- the long, slow f—k of the set has reached its climax. It seems astonishing {{when you think about it}} but Adam Ant is currently fronting one of the best rock n roll shows in the UK right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Dickinson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch, noted, [...] "'Superfly Sister' {{comes on}} like a classic Michael dance track, with Michael and Bryan Loren playing all the instruments...Blood On the Dance Floor [...] is {{definitely}} a dance record. It's not Thriller or Bad or even Off the Wall and it's not trying to be." [...] Jae-Ha Kim of Chicago Sun-Times, noted [...] "'Is It Scary' shows a darker side of Jackson than even the tabloids would have you believe...With the hypnotic 'Morphine', <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a seductive cousin of Trent Reznor's." [...] Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution gave the album a D grade. She claimed that, [...] "'Ghosts' pounds with funk until Jackson's weak vocals come in." [...] She described [...] "Morphine" [...] as an [...] "overblown rock hiss". The Virginian-Pilot gave the album a positive review, also expressing the opinion that [...] "Morphine" [...] sounded [...] "eerily like 'State of Shock'", and continued, [...] "'Scream Louder' a remix of his hit duet with sister Janet, {{is better than the}} original only because it takes away the overpowering guitar twangs." [...] The Washington Post described [...] "Superfly Sister" [...] as [...] "sex funk", adding, [...] "'Morphine' apparently told from the drug's point of view and featuring both the Andrae Crouch Singers and an orchestra, alternates between hard-edged rock and operatic pop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edna Gundersen of USA Today said, Eminem [...] "recaptures [...] the {{original}} release's wild, clever, emotional brilliance {{in a flurry}} of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review saying, [...] "If anything, the sequel is more intense than {{the original}}, as the Detroit rapper explodes like an M-80..... many memorable ones to be heard here, as Eminem doubles down on his manic flow, bursting with analogies, jokes, illusions, and ingenious wordplay with dizzying speed and skill". Dan Rys of XXL gave the album a rating of XL saying, [...] "the thing that carries Em through is the diversity of his flows, and his ability to rap over anything ..... you're getting one with more perspective, a version which has seen 13 more years and has a different outlook on some of the same topics that he first visited in 2000". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album a B rating, saying [...] "after years of stagnancy and tedious anger, he shows real growth on The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem has always rapped with forceful determination out of compulsive drives to prove himself to doubters, cut down his enemies, and retain his commercial foothold. For the first time in far too long, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he's rapping because he enjoys it, too." [...] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times gave the album a positive review saying, [...] "His lyrics are best viewed under a microscope..... to see how he gets from one rhyme to the next in unexpected ways..... he'll dominate almost any sound..... but he still has some old habits, still heavy-handed with homophobic slurs..... Eminem is still rapping from deep inside his cave, as if he's had no new experiences to draw from." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic spoke of the album saying, it is a [...] "vicious, infectious, hilarious triumph..... a super villain so familiar with hate and depression, he's powered by all shades of anger ..... most of the best moments on MMLP2 are just as angry and just as irresponsible..... Eminem at his very best." [...] Luke Fox of Exclaim! gave the album an eight out ten rating praising the albums [...] "astounding wordplay and creative beat choices".|$|E

[...] After Cui's death, Emperor Taiwu began to regret putting him to death, and mourned bitterly.|$|R
50|$|When casting for Futurama, Bender's {{voice was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a robot. John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition.|$|R

50|$|The first {{motion picture}} based on Lincoln was 1908 film The Reprieve: An Episode in the Life of Abraham Lincoln.
