40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{recently}} proposed scenario of asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync), in which dynamical uniformity and consensus in a distributed system would demand certain asymmetries in the underlying network, we investigate here the influence of some regularities in the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> patterns on the synchronization properties of multilayer random networks. More specifically, by considering a Stuart-Landau model of complex oscillators with random frequencies, we report for multilayer networks a dynamical behavior that could be also classified as a manifestation of AISync. We show, namely, that the presence of certain symmetries in the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> pattern tends to diminish the synchronization capability of the whole network or, in other words, asymmetries in the interlayer connections would enhance synchronization in such structured networks. Our results might help the understanding not only of the AISync mechanism itself, but also its possible role in the determination of the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> pattern of multilayer and other structured networks with optimal synchronization properties.

A method-ology to investigate heterogeneous interconnection schemes for 3 -D FPGAs under different 3 -D fabrication technologies is proposed.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} crack {{formation}} and development is addressed and implemented in a planar layered reinforced-concrete beam element. The crack initiation and growth is described using the strength criterion {{in conjunction with}} exact kinematics of the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection.</b> In this way a novel embedded-discontinuity beam finite element is derived in which the tensile stresses in concrete at the crack position reaching the tensile strength will trigger a crack to open. Since the element is multi-layered, {{in this way the}} crack is allowed to propagate through the depth of the beam. The cracked layer(s) will involve discontinuity in the cross-sectional rotation equal to the crack-profile angle, as well as a discontinuity in the position vector of the layer’s reference line. A bond–slip relationship is superimposed onto this model in a kinematically consistent manner with reinforcement being treated as an additional layer of zero thickness with its own material parameters and a constitutive law implemented in the multi-layered beam element. Emphasis in this work is placed on the definition and finite-element implementation of kinematics of such a layered beam set-up with embedded cracking, rather than on constitutional details of the concrete, steel and interface between them. Several numerical examples are presented, in which the ability of the proposed procedure to predict crack occurrence and development is investigated...|$|E

The advantage of timber and concrete such as the high tensile strength and high compressive strength respectively is used. Timber provides low structural load compared to concrete due to its low unit weight. Therefore the combination of concrete and timber for floor system is an alternative way to improve its structural performance of against tensile and compression stresses. Hence, development of timber-concrete composite (TCC) is crucial to reduce the use of cement in hlly reinforcement {{concrete floor}} by replacing LVL timber as web and concrete as flange of the T-beam strip.

30|$|The area of {{multilayer}} networks {{has seen}} an increasing interest and applicability {{in many different}} fields in recent years. A multilayer network {{can be defined as}} M=(G,C) where G is a set of graphs and C is the interconnection between them (Boccaletti et al. 2014). Several important metrics and descriptors of single layer networks have been generalized to the case of multilayers. For example in (De Domenico et al. 2013) the authors present a tensorial framework to study multi-layer networks and present many different topological metrics, generalized for the case of a multilayer approach. Other important works concentrate on the generalization of concepts, such as community detection, to the multilayer case. An example is (Mucha et al. 2010). Here the authors focus on the extension of the community detection approach to a multilayer network in a time dependent and multiscale environment. In (Cozzo et al. 2015) for example they generalize the concept of clustering coefficient for multilayer networks, showing drawbacks and difficulties of the generalization procedure from single layer to multi layer networks. In (De Domenico et al. 2016) the authors provide a deep and extended description of processes on multilayer networks, highlighting some of the physical phenomena that are related to spreading processes. A specific example of a multilayer network is the multiplex network in which each layer has the same nodes. Therefore the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> happen between each node and the correspondent one in the other layers.

40|$|AbstractA three-step {{model for}} the performance-based {{numerical}} simulations of the fire response of steel–RC two-layered beam-like composite structures is presented and validated. The first step consists of {{the determination of the}} evolution of temperatures in the structure׳s surroundings. Moisture and the heat transfer through the RC layer and the conduction of heat over the steel layer are obtained in the second step. In concrete, the transfer of water vapour, dry air, and free water is discussed as well as the evaporation and liquefaction phenomena and the dehydration of concrete and its thermal and mechanical degradation. Within the framework of the third step, a geometrically and materially non-linear mechanical response of the structure is proposed accounting for interlayer slips and uplifts as well as for various material-related phenomena such as the material hardening/softening and creep. The governing equations are solved numerically. An efficient, novel strain-based finite element formulation is introduced for the mechanical analysis. Due to its generality and consideration of several different possible non-linear material, geometrical, and interlayer contact phenomena and their couplings the model can be of a use to a broader fire science community for exploring the impact of different physical parameters on the results of the addressed numerical simulations, thereby providing directions for further research. In the paper a case of such a study is also demonstrated exploring the contribution of the steel sheet and the flexibility of the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> of a standard trapezoidal steel–RC slab to its ultimate fire resistance.

40|$|In a wood-concrete {{composite}} {{structural member}} the wood layer overlapped by the concrete layer are interconnected {{to prevent the}} relative slip. The stiffness of the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection</b> determines the degree of the composite behavior achieved. In this research notched shear-key connections were used with an embedded anchor detail. Wood-concrete composite structural members are usually applied in building structures. There are {{a relatively small number}} (in the low 100 s) of known bridge applications involving wood-concrete composites. A problem with using these novel composite members in bridges with high traffic is that the fatigue behavior of the composite member under long-term repeated loading is not known. This paper presents the result of a research at Colorado State University and Metropolitan State College of Denver, performed in coordination with work at University of Stuttgart, attempting to establish the S-N curve for fatigue loading of notched wood-concrete connections based on low/high-cycle, repeated loading tests. Experimental results are obtained on fourteen 1524 mm span composite beam specimens of 191 mm width, with a 89 mm thick wood layer consisting of five “ 2 x 4 ” boards and a 63 mm concrete layer, which are interconnected by embedded anchor screws at the notch locations. Five specimens are only statically loaded while the others are cycled to failure with a maximum to minimum pulsating load ratio of 10. Points on the S-N curve are determined for three levels of the maximum load {{as a function of the}} average static failure load. Typical observed failure modes are block-shear of the wood at the notch and tension failure of the wood at mid-span. As a result, the obtained S-N curve could be proposed for future consideration in drafting design codes addressing the timber-concrete composite structures...|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{developed}} low {{aspect ratio}} dental discontinuous-FRC are micrometer-scale discontinuous-FRCs, which lack sufficient strength and fracture toughness to reinforce structures reinforced with them. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to evaluate the fracture resistance, the bonding properties {{as well as some}} mechanical properties of newly developed millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC. Fiber- and matrix related properties were also analyzed. Four studies were designed to evaluate the fracture resistance and the failure mode of anterior restorations reinforced with millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC, to assess the shear bonding strength between incrementally placed layers of this fibrous composite, to measure the thickness and the effect of the oxygen inhibition layer (OIL) on the interlayer bonding characteristics as well as to determine various physicomechanical properties. In addition, fiber related properties, including fiber volume fraction, fiber length, critical fiber length and fiber diameter, and matrix related properties, fiber orientation were computed. The results of these studies show that the use of millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC post-core-crown structure was advantageous in terms of both provided reinforcement and failure mode. Furthermore, it was found that OIL presence improves the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection.</b> The protruding fibers ends at the interface between the fibrous composite layers and the semi-IPN were considered to promote the durable adhesion upon OIL removal. Millimeter-scale fibers substantially improved the fracture toughness owing to the fibers ability to bridge the crack, blunt the crack tip and carry the load, accompanied with the semi-IPN aided plasticity. However, fibers shorter than 0. 4 mm most likely behave as reinforcing filler particles instead of reinforcing fibers. Furthermore, fiber orientation was found to be important for impeding the crack progression. These studies suggest that millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC should accompany the individually FRC post insertion and should fill the pulp chamber and extend coronally as core material, to provide retention and to strengthen the cervical portion of the tooth. Alternatively, it could be used as post-core structure. In both cases homogenous unit is assumed, due to the identical composition of the materials. Upon curing, the OIL should be left {{on the surface of the}} composite and should not be contaminated. This could improve the bonding and improve the inherent fracture resistance of the material. This was observed also in the ability of the material to resist the fracture propagation, which approached the toughness value of dentin. These studies indicate that the benefits of using millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC are especially the improved fracture toughness and resistance to fracture, as well as improved interlayer bonding compared to conventional composites. Moreover, using of millimeter-scale discontinuous-FRC changes the fracture pattern and more reparable fractures were found for this material...|$|E
40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} {{beams and}} slabs require <b>interlayer</b> <b>connection,</b> which provides composite {{action for the}} cross-section. A range of mechanical connectors {{is available on the}} market with an extensive variety of stiffness and strength properties, which are fundamental design parameters for the composite structure. Stiff and strong connection systems are highly desirable in order to achieve high composite action. At the same time, however, the connectors should be inexpensive, so as to make the composite beam an economically viable alternative to the traditional precast concrete and steel-concrete composite floor systems. This paper reports the outcomes of an experimental programme carried out on timber-concrete composite systems with prefabricated concrete slabs. The programme included shear tests to failure of different connection systems and 4 -point bending tests to failure of five 4. 8 m long timber-concrete composite beam specimens. Based on the outcomes of the shear tests, two different connector types were selected for the full-scale beam tests: (i) steel tubes inserted into the concrete slab and screwed to the glulam beam, and (ii) single folded steel plates nailed to both sides of the glulam beam and welded onto a long punched metal plate embedded into the concrete slab. The new systems based on mechanical "dry-dry" connectors embedded into a pre-cast concrete slab have the advantage of not requiring pouring and curing of concrete on site. This will result in a significant improvement in the entire construction process by achieving higher quality while saving resources and simplifying recycling of waste. The beam specimens were ramp loaded to failure to assess the structural performance at ultimate and serviceability limit state. Mid-span deflection, applied load, and slip distribution along the beam length were monitored during the tests. The efficiencies of the new proposed connection systems, calculated by comparing the experimental results with the analytical limits of full and no composite action, were found {{to be in the same}} range as for connections with cast-in-situ concrete slabs. Some improvements such as a larger number of nails or larger diameter nails or screws are possible for the connection with metal plates nailed to the glulam beam in order to increase the composite action achievable by the system. The experimental load-displacement curves and slip distribution along the beam length were compared with the outcomes of a numerical analysis performed using a uniaxial finite element model purposely developed for timber-concrete composite beams. The actual shear force-relative slip measured in the shear tests were implemented in the software. Very good agreement was found, enabling the use of the program for parametric studies aimed to extend the experimental results to composite beams with different geometrical and mechanical properties. The use of the analytical formulae suggested by Ceccotti in accordance with the Eurocode 5 was found to provide acceptable accuracy for the design of the composite structure. In conclusion, the new developed composite systems based on the use of concrete slab prefabricated off-site and connected on site with timber beam can represent a viable alternative to the traditional composite systems with cast-in-situ concrete topping, with similar efficiencies achievable but all the advantages of the prefabrication.

For the wood material, the research extends {{the formulation of}} a previous rheological model, originally proposed for uniaxial stress state of wood exposed to moisture variations, to 3 D finite-element modeling with a multiaxial stress state. For the concrete material, a standard creep model for uniaxial stress states was approximated using a generalized Maxwell’s model and then expanded to 3 D formulations. The 3 D model described in this paper was implemented via external user subroutines in the commercial software ABAQUS. Finite-element models for a wood-concrete composite beam with notched shear key were developed to model the diffusion problem of moisture content and the heat transfer when the beam is exposed to the environment. The moisture content, temperature profiles, and long-term static loading are used as input parameters for the time-dependent analysis problem involving the expanded material models. The results of numerical models are compared and verified with available experimental results {{as well as with}} numerical results obtained using a more simplified one-dimensional (1 D) beam model previously developed. Although the improvement in accuracy compared to the 1 D model is insignificant, the 3 D model has the advantage of not requiring mechanical and rheological characterization of the connection, which can only be carried out via expensive short- and long-term experimental tests. ...|$|R

But the modern multilayer circuit, with its full length Plated-Through Boles (PTH), {{is a highly}} stressed structure, prone to del-amination, barrel fracture and other modes of self [...] destruction. The plating of copper into smaller and smaller diameter holes, of ever increasing length, has brought us close to the practical lim-its of this technology.

40|$|Trend towards {{downsizing}} {{the product}} size {{and at the}} same time to bring more functionality in electronic products, demands electrically interconnecting several miniaturized electronic components with high counts of I (Input/Out put) on smaller and smaller size printed wiring boards [PWB]. These miniature components occupy lower foot print area but require higher routing interconnection densities. However, the conventional multilayer board technologies exhibit limitations when there is need to connect very high IØ components such as ball grid arrays, which require blind and buried interconnections within the multilayer mono-block. This limitation has given raise to newer methods of multi layer construction. Build–up multilayer PWB is now the technology of choice for enhanced routing capability including blind and buried <b>interlayer</b> <b>connections.</b> Build up methods are based on making very small vias within dielectric layers followed by metalisation. Typically blind and buried vias are very small, and hence called “micro vias” connecting the layers selectively within the multilayer mono-block. Buried vias make the interconnection between the consecutive layers, and blind vias connect the surface layers to any one of the interior layers in the build up multilayer board. If the blind vias are filled with a dielectric, the entire top and bottom surface area becomes available for high -density component mounting. The crux in build up board technologies is the method of creating micro-holes; a micro hole is a hole, which is less than 150 micro meter in diameter. Efforts are made to replace existing metalising techniques with “paste filling” methodologies, which would result in “SOLID CONDUCTING VIAS” CALLED AS “MICRO -INTERCONNECTS” The work reported in this thesis aims at demonstrating one such innovative ‘solid conducting via’ formation without using any of the known micro-hole formation techniques.

40|$|AbstractModern {{theory of}} {{networks}} {{has been recognized}} as a very successful methodological concept for the description and analysis of complex systems. However, some complex systems are more complex than others. For instance, several real-life systems are constituted by interdependent subsystems and their elements are subjected to different types of interactions that can also change with time. Recently, the multilayer network formalism has been proposed as a general theoretical framework for the description and analysis of such multi-dimensional complex systems and is acquiring more and more prominence {{in terms of a}} new research direction. In the present study, we use this methodology for the description of functional connectivity patterns and signal propagation between pancreatic beta cells in an islet of Langerhans at the levels of membrane potential (MP) and cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]c) dynamics to study the extent of overlap in the two networks and to clarify whether time lags between the two signals in individual cells are in any way dependent on the role these cells play in the functional networks. The two corresponding network layers are constructed on the basis of signal directions and pairwise correlations, whereas the <b>interlayer</b> <b>connections</b> represent the time lag between both measured signals. Our results confirm our previous finding that both MP and [Ca 2 +]c change spread across an islet {{in the form of a}} depolarization and a [Ca 2 +]c wave, respectively. Both types of waves follow nearly the same path and the networks in both layers have a similar but not entirely the same structure. We show that the observed discrepancies are attributed to variability in delays between the depolarization and rise in [Ca 2 +]c. In particular, high-degree nodes in both layers are found to exhibit a larger time lag between the MP and the [Ca 2 +]c signal than nodes with less connections. We speculate that this finding reflects a higher activity of endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps in the most connected cells. Our findings indicate that visualizing and studying the temporal information flow and interaction patterns between beta cells as a multiplex network can provide valuable new insights into the physiology of the complex signaling processes in islets of Langerhans...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the development of fabrication techniques and novel designs for self-packaged, multilayer circuits using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) materials exclusively, given the favourable characteristics this material has for microwave circuits. Fabrication techniques are aimed at the production of miniature, low-profile filters. Advanced techniques for production of <b>interlayer</b> via <b>connections</b> are investigated and new methods proposed, with special attention at the lamination process and production of vertical, inter-layer transitions. Results obtained demonstrate the fabrication process is reliable for producing multilayer filters, with up to four metal layers, and via transitions in the region of 0. 2 mm diameter. The fabrication process has been developed during this work is applied to novel filter designs, covering dual-band filters and lowpass filters. A new structure for dual- band filter is proposed, using folded multimode resonators (FMSIR). This structure is validated through the fabrication of two different filters with passbands 1. 2 / 2. 4 GHz, and 2. 4 / 5 GHz, showing deep off-band rejection. Low pass structure covered in this thesis is based on the principle of destructive interference and aims at low insertion loss and out-of-band rejection higher than 40 dB. Fabricated samples validate the design showing a rejection in the region of 42 dB, with a cuto frequency of 3 GHz. Its small footprint and low insertion loss allows this type of lters to be used as cleanup filters. All the designs covered in this work are simulated using CAD tools and then validated by measurements on fabricated samples...|$|R
40|$|Hydration {{properties}} of swelling clay minerals {{may be very}} variable depending on the chemical composition of the clay, {{on the nature of}} the interlayer cations and on the interlayer charge (Berend et al., 1995; Vieillard et al., 2011). The Wyoming smectite has been largely studied, notably for assessing its hydration behavior as a function of the <b>interlayer</b> cations, in <b>connection</b> with its structural characteristics (Ferrage et al., 2005; Salles et al., 2007). In the present work, carried out as part of a collaborative Andra/BRGM/HydrASA research program for ThermoChimie project, we propose an original experimental study, based on adsorption and desorption isotherms performed on MX 80 clay samples. The goal is to determine energetic contributions to the reactions of hydration, which have been revealed to be non-negligible with respect to the stability of the clay minerals (Gailhanou et al., submitted). In particular, the present work addresses the problems of the hysteresis loop between adsorption and desorption isotherms and of the irreversibility of hydration reactions. This is directly related to the application of classical thermodynamics to the hydration reactions of clay minerals. In a first stage, an experimental study is dedicated to better understand the origin of the hysteresis loop which is systematically observed for the adsorption-desorption isotherms at 25 °C. The development of the hysteresis loop has been studied by considering several kinetically relate...|$|R
40|$|ITC/USA 2014 Conference Proceedings / The Fiftieth Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 20 - 23, 2014 / Town and Country Resort & Convention Center, San Diego, CAThis paper {{addresses}} the future military munitions' system requirements for antennas {{in terms of}} the existing versus new fabrication technology. The antenna requirements of the future smart munitions will be GPS for precision guidance and TM for system performance testing. The environmental requirements remain the same; large temperature operating range with operation at high temperatures and high shock capable. As usual, the munitions are getting smaller, frequency bandwidth is getting larger, and the cost of the antennas must be minimized in production quantities. In particular this paper compares the existing antenna fabrication technology of Teflon based dielectric printed circuits versus multilayer alumina in the green state, a technology that has been perfected for fabricating microwave integrated circuits (MIC's). The trade-offs that will be addressed are temperature, shock, cost, tunability, loss, size, dielectric constant, and frequency bandwidth. There has been a significant effort to miniaturize the GPS and TM antenna using higher dielectric constant materials. The most popular direction of this effort has been to use ceramic impregnated Teflon. The ultimate temperature performance is the material with a dielectric constant around 2 since this material exhibits a very low coefficient of change with temperature. Materials are available with nominal dielectric constants of 6 and 10 {{to reduce the size of}} the antenna but the coefficient of change with temperature is very large and leaves these materials marginal for military temperature ranges. There have also been two other problems with Teflon based printed circuit boards, forming and bonding the boards in a 3 D shape and homogeneity of the dielectric constant in the board and after bonding. These problems usually make tuning a requirement and drive the cost of antenna fabrication up. There has been a revolution in MIC's. The circuits are now being made with multiple layers of ceramic (alumina) with <b>interlayer</b> conductive <b>connections</b> and a nominal dielectric constant of 10. The layers are formed in the green state and fired at high temperature and the resulting alumina substrate has a very low coefficient of change with temperature and low loss. Since this procedure is now beyond development, the cost is low and the volume capability is high. Another significant point is that the part can be any shape since the substrate is done in the green state (formable) and then fired...|$|R
