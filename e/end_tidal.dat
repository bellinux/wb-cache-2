40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the elastic equilibrium volume (Vr) of the respiratory system in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). METHODS: Voluntary relaxed expiration from total lung capacity (TLC) was studied in three groups of subjects: seven patients with severe chronic airways obstruction (COPD), 10 normal subjects, and 15 subjects with restrictive disease. RESULTS: In the normal subjects and the patients with restrictive disease voluntary relaxed expiration from TLC stopped close to <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> volume (FRC) and the volume expired in this manoeuvre was less than that expired in a slow vital capacity manoeuvre (SVC). In the patients with COPD the voluntary relaxed expiration continued beyond the <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> volume (FRC) and the volume expired was not different from the SVC. Oesophageal (pleural) pressures and surface diaphragmatic EMG recordings in the patients with COPD supported the premise that relaxation was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> volume (FRC) is higher than the elastic equilibrium volume, Vr, of the respiratory system. This is in contrast to patients with restrictive disease and normal subjects in whom <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> volume (FRC) is close to Vr.

40|$|Background: Preoxygenation with {{tidal volume}} {{breathing}} for 3 min {{is commonly used}} technique. An <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> expiratory oxygen concentration greater than 90 % is considerd to be adequate for preoxygenation. The {{aim of this study}} was to check the effects of preoxygenation on elderly patients through the comparison with young patients during the 3 min tidal volume breathing technique. Methods: Sixty patients from ASA class I or II who were scheduled for elective orthopedic general surgery were divided into an elderly (> 65 yr) group and a control (25 - 65 yr) group. Patients were instructed in the technique of preoxygenation. Preoxygenation was accomplished with an appropriately sized face mask connected to an anesthesia machine with 100 % oxygen during 3 min with patients in both groups. Expired O 2, CO 2 concentration and oxygen saturation were recorded simultaneously for 3 min. Results: The elderly group showed significantly lower <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> oxygen concentration than the control group from 50 sec to the end of study (180 sec) with the 3 min tidal volume breathing technique (P < 0. 05). In 180 sec, the control group had over 90 % (91. 5 %) <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> oxygen concentration, but in the elderly group <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> oxygen concentration could not reach 90 % (86. 2 %).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effects of low tidal volume {{ventilation}} on patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery on partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial to <b>end</b> <b>tidal</b> carbon dioxide gradient and acid base excess. Methods: 30 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under General Anaesthesia were ventilated with tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 12 breaths/minute and <b>End</b> <b>tidal</b> C 02, PaC 02, pH, Bicarbonate and ABE measurement was done before, during and after C 02 pneumoperitoneum and analyzed. Respiratory adjustments were done for <b>End</b> <b>tidal</b> CO 2 levels above 60 mmHg or haemodynamic changes attributable to elevated CO 2. Results: Pneumoperitoneum resulted in a significant elevation in PaCO 2 (p< 0. 001) and a fall of pH (p < 0. 001), ion bicarbonate (p = 0. 011), and base excess (p < 0. 001). A correlation was found between the EtCO 2 and PaCO 2 during pneumoperitoneum. No ventilatory adjustments were instituted on any of the patients as they maintained EtCO 2 below 60 mmHg throughout pneumoperitoneum. Conclusion: Besides the expected respiratory acidosis, a metabolic acidosis can also be present during pneumoperitoneum.

While poor residents have developed coping mechanisms, such community efforts follow the logic of maintaining a precarious minimum of safety.

40|$|The {{locations}} of the fully despun, double synchronous <b>end</b> states of <b>tidal</b> evolution are derived for spherical components. With the exception of nearly equal-mass binaries, binary asteroid systems {{are in the midst}} of lengthy tidal evolutions, far from their fully synchronous <b>tidal</b> <b>end</b> states. Calculations of material strength indicate that binaries in the main belt with 100 -km-scale primary components are consistent with being made of monolithic or fractured rock as expected for binaries likely formed from sub-catastrophic impacts in the early solar system. To tidally evolve in their dynamical lifetime, near-Earth binaries with km-scale primaries or smaller must be much weaker mechanically than their main-belt counterparts even if formed in the main belt prior to injection into the near-Earth region. Small main-belt binaries with primary components less than 10 km in diameter, depending on their ages, could either be as strong as large main-belt binaries or as weak as near-Earth binaries because the inherent uncertainty in the age of a binary system can affect the calculation of material strength by orders of magnitude. Several other issues are considered, though these typically affect the calculation of material strength by no more than a factor of two. We also find indirect evidence within all three groups of binary asteroids that the inter-component separation may evolve via another mechanism(s) with the binary YORP effect being a likely candidate.
