50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{micro-irrigation}} systems. Many of the components are {{the same for all}} of these types of systems. Most systems typically include filters, pipes, valves, and tubing. The main difference is in the type of emission device that is used to deliver the water to the plants. Drip irrigation utilizes <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> that deliver water at very low rates. The typical range is 0.2 to 4.0 gallons per hour. In some systems, the emitters are installed manually {{on the outside of the}} tubing and placed where needed. Other systems might use integral dripperline or drip tape with the emitters already installed at a predetermined spacing. Micro-sprinklers, which can include fixed stream sprays and rotating spinners typically deliver water at a higher rate, such as 10 to 25 gallons per hour and will cover a larger area than <b>drip</b> <b>emitters.</b> These are more typically used in tree orchards where the plants are larger.The goal is to distribute water slowly in small volumes and target it to plants' root zones with less runoff or overspray than landscape and garden conventional spray and rotary sprinklers. The low volume allows the water to penetrate and be absorbed into slow-percolation soils, such as clay, minimizing water runoff.|$|E
50|$|Underground {{sprinklers}} function through {{means of}} basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve {{and all of}} the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located {{in the center of the}} valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers. These sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5-2m (7-15 ft.), full rotating sprinklers that can spray a broken stream of water from 6-12m (20-40 ft.), or small <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. use of indigenous materials also recommended.|$|E

Performance similar to factory-installed <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> was achieved at low pressure, but the necessary watertight seals repeatedly burst at higher water pressures. Alterations to the drip emitter and installation procedure are recommended to increase reliability and resilience of the installation. by Eric Johnson. Thesis: S.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biofouling {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major contributor to emitter clogging in drip irrigation systems that distribute reclaimed wastewater. Two types of <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> were evaluated for use with reclaimed wastewater. Microbial biofilm accumulations, including proteins, polysaccharides, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), were tested to determine the biofilm development and diversity in the emitter flow path. The microbial biofilm structure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed rapid growth of the biofilm and accumulated sediments that led to eventual reduction of emitter discharge, and the biofilm played an inducing role in the clogging process. Biomass growth in the emitter flow path fluctuated as biomass was scoured off the surface areas. The scoured sediment tended to accumulate and clog the outlets or other emitter parts. Microphotographs revealed microparticles in the biofilm matrix coupling with extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and showed the biofilm attachment process that would initiate clogging in the emitter flow path. The particle size of the clogging sediment can be very small, and filtration alone was not an effective treatment to control emitter clogging. This study provides some suggestions for control of clogging, and it may provide a framework for future investigations into the role of biofilms in the clogging of <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> that distribute reclaimed wastewater...|$|E
40|$|This thesis details {{a hybrid}} {{computational}} and analytical model {{to predict the}} performance of inline pressure-compensating (PC) <b>drip</b> <b>emitters.</b> A verified CFD model is used to predict flow behavior through tortuous paths. A method of extracting a pressure scaling parameter from the CFD results for use in an analytical model is presented. Analytical expressions that describe the bending of asymmetric rectangular membranes in inline <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> are detailed. These expressions are combined with finite element analysis (FEA) describing the shearing behavior of the membrane to model the total flow resistance through the emitter. Analytical expressions that describe the fluid mechanics of duct and turbulent flows are used to predict the net flow rate out of the emitter. The final model is verified for three distinct emitter geometries. The hybrid model {{presented in this paper}} has wide applicability - it can be applied to asymmetrical emitter geometries that have tortuous paths and other complex flow geometries. The hybrid model benefits from the accuracy of computational modeling for complex flows and contact interactions, and the processing speed of analytical models. Because of its accuracy and speed, the model can be used reliably as a design tool for inline PC emitters. by Jaya Narain. Thesis: S.

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} {{techniques have}} been used in the agricultural production industry as an advanced water-saving irrigation method in recent decades. However advantageous this method, there are still some difficulties in projecting the efficiency of such systems. Most especially, determination of the losses because of the emitters is very important in order to set up an efficient irrigation system. This study is focused on determining head losses for agricultural drip irrigation systems with cylindrical in-line type <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. In the study, three-dimensional solid models of five in-line type <b>drip</b> <b>emitters,</b> which have a volumetric flow capacity of 4. 0 [l h- 1] and placed in a pipe with 250 [mm] intervals between each other, were considered and CFD analyses were carried out with different inlet pressure values. According to the results of the CFD analyses, hydraulic losses were calculated globally and locally and analysis outputs were presented to determine the head losses due to the inclusion of the emitters. Validations for results of the simulation were also achieved by using empirical equations taken from related literature. As a result, maximum simulation error rate of 8. 824 [%] was observed between simulations and empirical equations taken from related literature results. This accordance between simulation and empirical results can be interpreted that CFD analyses could be used to calculate the critical flow parameters such as total head losses of drip irrigation pipes integrated with in-line emitters...|$|E

Despite this rapid expansion, little is known of the potential impacts of the water’s chemical constituents on soil properties, or the long-term sustainability of the vineyards using the water. In order to establish the impacts of drip irrigated recycled wastewater on a vineyard in Great Western, Australia, a study comparing the soils from the vineyard inter-row and row area was undertaken. Chemical and physical properties of the soil with varying distances from the <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> were also investigated.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate mainly the effects of saline water (EC = 2. 2 ~ 4. 9 dS/m) on cucumber yield, irrigation quantity and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) under drip irrigation in North China Plain, when the soil matrix potential (SMP) at 0. 2 m depth immediately under <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> was controlled from - 10 to - 50 kPa. The experiment results indicated when irrigation water salinity (EC i) was greater than 1. 1 dS/m, cucumber yield decreased with the increasing of EC i. When the SMP at 0. 2 m depth immediately under <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> was controlled between - 25 and - 35 kPa, cucumber showed the most resistant to salinity, and cucumber yield decreased about 3 % for 1 dS/m increase of EC. When the treatment with a higher SMP (- 10 kPa), the irrigation quantity was more, and the IWUE was lower; whereas the treatment with a lower SMP(- 50 kPa), the irrigation quantity was less, and the IWUE was higher.

40|$|In {{semi-arid}} Mediterranean environments, {{the loss}} of soil fertility can be avoided through the optimization and innovation of low environmental impact agricultural techniques. Such ‘innovative’, suitable agricultural management practices can have positive effects on soil microbial communities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the effects of two different agricultural systems (‘innovative’ and ‘conventional’) on the diversity of important groups of microorganisms related to soil fertility, such as fungi, actinomycetes, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Azotobacter spp., proteolytic and ammonifying bacteria. The study was carried out in an apricot orchard located in Southern Italy. Since 2003, half of the orchard was managed adopting no-tillage, cover crops, compost application, drip irrigation, winter pruning and limited mineral fertilization, whereas the other half was subjected to ‘conventional’ management. Soil samples were randomly collected from the superficial soil layer in four different orchard positions: innovative along the inter-rows (IIR) and under <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> (IUE), and conventional along the inter-rows (CIR) and under <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> (CUE). Higher populations of total bacteria, actinomycetes and proteolytic bacteria were induced by IIR treatment, whereas Pseudomonas spp., Azotobacter spp. and ammonifying bacteria showed increased populations in IUE. No differences between the treatments were found for total fungi and Bacillus spp. The higher inputs of organic matter of innovative plots caused an increase in the microbial groups responsible for nitrogen metabolism in well-watered zones (IUE), and higher activities of decomposer and humus-forming microorganisms in IIR. Results show that suitable agricultural practices can have positive effects on microbial activities and complexity, which in turn influence soil fertility...|$|E
40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} {{was compared to}} sprinkler irrigation on bermudagrass turf during three consecutive years using tertiary treated wastewater. Irrigation amount required by each treatment, visual appearance of the grass, shoot biomass production, and soil salinity were measured, and potential management problems were identified. The amount of irrigation water applied via subsurface irrigation was similar or higher than that applied via sprinkler irrigation for a turf of similar quality. Shoot biomass production did not differ between both irrigation methods when similar amounts of water were applied. Soil salinity, measured as electrical conductivity, was monitored {{at the beginning and}} end of each season. The changes in electrical conductivity at the end of every irrigation season did not negatively affect the appearance of the turf in any of the years. Emitter clogging by root intrusion was identified as a potential problem in the subsurface {{drip irrigation}} system. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of different herbicides and acids at several concentrations on root intrusion into subsurface <b>drip</b> <b>emitters.</b> The first greenhouse experiment was a study intended to identify chemical concentrations that could inhibit bermudagrass root growth in soil without negatively affecting the visual appearance of the grass.

The whole soil-water-plant system was monitored on an experimental tomato field in Crete to assess the potential element accumulation due to drip irrigation with secondary treated wastewaters during three years. Although a decrease of the majority of element average concentrations (Mn, As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn and B) was observed in irrigated soils possibly due to crop export, increasing amounts of elements, especially for As, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Na were measured in the bio-accessible and mobilisable fractions of the soil. Moreover, we show that surface drip irrigation can lead to very localized accumulation of trace metals driven by geochemical processes as pointed out by soil mapping. Transient but significant Na and B contents can also develop under the emitter in the soil fractions during secondary treated wastewater irrigation. Pb displayed no spatial relation with the <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> and its main sources were petrol-Pb aerosols and Saharan dusts. The trace metal contents and salinity indicators in crops stayed below the regulatory thresholds. Sequential dissolutions combined with the Pb isotopic tool traced element mobility and dynamics in an irrigated soil at short term, and were useful to distinguish between medium-term experiment at bulk soil scale and short-term impacts of secondary treated wastewaters irrigation at the <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> scale...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of soil matric potential (SMP) on tomato yield, evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) under drip irrigation condition in North China Plain. The experiment included five treatments, which controlled SMP at 0. 2 m depth immediately under <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> higher than - 10 (S 1), - 20 (S 2), - 30 (S 3), - 40 (S 4) and - 50 kPa (S 5), respectively, after tomato plant establishmenf. The results showed that different SMP affected irrigation amount and tomato ET. Irrigation amount decreased from 185 mm (S 1) to 83. 6 mm (S 5) and from 165 mm (SI) to 109 mm (S 5) in 2005, respectively. The ET decreased from in 2004, 270 mm. (S 1) to 202 mm (S 5) in both years. However, {{it was found that}} SMP did not affect the tomato yield significantly, for the range of SMP investigated. Both WUE and IWUE increased as SMP decreased. The maximum WUE (253 and 217 kg/ha mm) and IWUE (620 and 406 kg/ha mm) were for S 5 in 2 years, whereas the minimum WUE (178 and 155 kg/ha mm) and IWUE 261 and 259 kg/ha mm) were for S 1 in 2004 and 2005. Based on the above results, therefore, it is recommended that if the tomatoes are well irrigated (SMP is higher than - 20 kPa) during establishment, controlling SMP higher than - 50 kPa at 0. 2 m. depth immediately under <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> can be used as an indicator for drip irrigation scheduling during following period of tomato growth in North China Plain.

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} is a {{means of}} distributing the exact amount of water a plant needs by dripping water directly onto the root zone. It can produce up to 90 % more crops than rain-fed irrigation, and reduce water consumption by 70 % compared to conventional flood irrigation. In the coming years, the demand for new, low-cost, low-power drip irrigation technology will continue to grow, particularly in developing countries. It will enable millions of poor farmers to rise out of poverty by growing more and higher value crops, while not contributing to overconsumption of water. The key inhibitor to drip adoption has been the high initial investment cost. A cost and pressure analysis revealed that a reduction in activation pressure of pressure compensating (PC) <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> - which can maintain a constant flow rate under variations in pressure, to ensure uniform water distribution on a field - can reduce the cost of off-grid drip systems by up to 50 %. These emitter have been designed and optimized empirically in the past. In this thesis, I present a parametric model that describes the fluid and solid mechanics that govern the behavior of a common PC emitter architecture, which uses a flexible diaphragm to limit flow. The model was validated by testing nine prototypes with geometric variations, all of which matched predicted performance to within R 2 = 0. 85. This parametric model was then coupled with a genetic algorithm to achieve a lower activation pressure of 0. 15 bar for not only the 8. 2 lph emitter, but also the 4, 6, 7 lph emitters. These new <b>drip</b> <b>emitters,</b> with attributes that improve performance and lower cost, are a step closer to making drip irrigation economically accessible to all throughout the world. by Pulkit Shamshery.

Soil and soil leachate pH likewise decreased from 7. 3 to 4. 5 in the second experiment, but in this case, pH took up to 10 days longer to decline in the 14 -L pots than in the 4 -L pots.

Drip tubing as a means of applying domestic wastewater to soil is increasing in use, especially in clayey soils that are unsuitable for traditional disposal systems. Experiments were undertaken to evaluate operational constraints of drip tubing in regards to the reduction of Escherichia coli in wastewater that reaches the soil surface and the number of instances of wastewater surfacing in these clayey soils. Water colored with a dye and inoculated with E. coli was applied to soil through <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> at four dosing rates at two sites. Populations of E. coli in water that reached the soil surface were reduced by less than 20 %, regardless of the dosing rate. Approximately 50 % of emitters produced water on the soil surface at Site 1 and emitters at Site 2 produced few surfacings. Upon excavation, preferential flow was determined to be the mechanism for wastewater reaching the soil surface. Two depths of burial, 15 and 30 cm, were examined to determine depth effects on the frequency of wastewater reaching the soil surface using newly installed drip tubing. Deeper burial inhibited wastewater from reaching the soil surface, but did not eliminate preferential flow. E. coli populations were not reduced in surfacing wastewater when the depth of burial was increased. These same soils were found to remove greater than 99 % of the cells when contaminated water was applied in laboratory column studies. However, this soil was free of preferential flow paths. When water was applied to a uniformly disturbed soil, the distribution of water was not uniformly dispersed spherically around the emitter. Instead, water flowed conically toward the microcosm surface when soil water (P[w]) was highest and dispersed {{into the bottom of the}} microcosm in drier samples.

It was verified that an increase in the number of emitters in the lateral line promoted better root distribution, higher water extraction, and less deep percolation losses.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that the serious clogging of <b>drip</b> irrigation <b>emitters</b> in the Dutch greenhouse industry is caused by methane-oxidising bacteria and/or organic acids used as anti-clogging agents. In this study greenhouses with moderate to severe emitter clogging have been examined. High methane concentrations-up to 69 mg/l-were found both in ground water (GW) and in the water from reverse osmosis (RO); however, in the fertiliser-mixing tanks (MTs), methane concentrations wer...|$|R
40|$|An {{irrigation}} <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> {{can have}} various complex shapes with very small geometric labyrinth channel structures. Determining the optimum {{pressure in the}} lateral line and the desired flow volume for the emitter, which {{can be obtained by}} changing the channel’s geometry, is an extremely important factor. The ability to observe flow behaviour is significantly difficult in the labyrinth structure of the emitter using traditional methods because the channels are so small. In this study, a 3 D CAD solid model of a sample emitter was created and the flow behaviour was simulated in its labyrinth channels by using a flow simulation technique. Referenced by the original design, the channel geometry was modified and the emitter was re-fabricated using rapid prototyping / additive manufacturing techniques. The flow behaviour is then re-investigated based on the re-shaped channel geometry of the labyrinth structure. The predetermined optimum pressure in the pipe was validated experimentally for both the original design and modified designs. As a result, the optimum pressure in the pipe and the flow characteristics for original both the design and modified designs of the emitter were validated. This study contributes to further research into the development of agricultural irrigation equipment aided through the utilisation of additive manufacturing and computer aided engineering tools...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the performance of different configurations of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) by measuring coffee (Coffea arabica L.) leaf water potential. Six treatments of drip irrigation combining two <b>drip</b> <b>emitters.</b> spaced at 0. 50 and 0. 80 m, with three drip placement depths: 0 cm (soil surface), 0. 10 m and 0. 20 cm. The combined treatments were: T 1 (50 - 0), T 2 (50 - 10), T 3 (50 - 20), T 4 (80 - 0), T 5 (80 - 10) and T 6 (80 - 20). Leafwater potential was measured using a Scholander pressure pump at predawn and during the day. Both surface drip irrigation treatments showed a lower predawn leaf water potential. The treatment that presented better performance with higher water potential values was T 2. Another fact observed was that treatments with wider spacing between emitters (T 4, T 5 and T 6) always presentd higher water stress than other treatments, mainly in the period when irrigation was suppressed (June, 25 th to September, 14 th) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} and nitrogen fertilization {{on the growth}} characteristics of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), specifically the clone CCN- 51, was evaluate in a field experiment conducted on the period from August 2010 to June 2011 in Jequié city, Bahia State, Brazil. The experimental area, approximately 0. 18 ha with the planting of cocoa clonal CCN- 51 in Yellow Oxisol was irrigated <b>drip</b> <b>emitters.</b> The statistical experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications where the factors water level and nitrogen level were factorial combined resulting in the 16 treatments. During the experimental period were measured plant height and stem diameter during six periods. The analysis of variance showed a significant effect of water and N levels in plant height and stem diameter. The biometric variables responded to treatments. The water level {{used in this study}} negatively affected the plant growth. The nitrogen level used in this study positively influenced the plant growth. The relative growth rate in relation to the plant height and stem diameter, on average, corresponded to about 14 % and 15 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the productive and vegetative responses of ‘Gala’ and 'Fuji' apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) trees to deficit irrigation and partial rootzone drying under the dry climate of central Sicily. Soil water tension (SWT), stomatal conductance, yield, fruit quality, fruit growth, and shoot extension of conventionally irrigated trees (CI), where <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> {{on both sides}} of each tree were left open, were compared to that of partial rootzone drying (PRD) trees, where only one side of the rootzone was irrigated for the entire season (receiving 50 % of the CI irrigation water), and to that of deficit irrigated (DI) trees, where <b>drip</b> <b>emitters</b> {{on both sides of}} the rootzone were delivering 50 % of the CI irrigation water for the entire season. The irrigation season started on 21 June and ended on 4 Sep, 2006. In CI trees and on the wet side of PRD trees, SWT remained generally above - 50 kPa (about 80 % field capacity) and followed oscillations due to irrigation cycles. In DI and the dry side of PRD trees, SWT progressively decreased to values around - 200 kPa. In PRD trees, wet and dry sides were alternated at intervals of about 20 days. In both 'Gala' and 'Fuji', gs of DI trees was significantly lower than that of CI trees (52 % reductions) during the entire irrigation period, while gs of PRD trees exhibited intermediate levels (24 % reductions). Fruit size and fruit and shoot growth rate was similar for all treatments and in both cultivars, although 'Gala' fruits of PRD trees tended to be larger than those of CI and DI, and 'Fuji' shoots stopped growing earlier than 'Gala' shoots. In both cultivars, trees of the three treatments had similar yields, number of fruits, yield efficiency, although 'Gala' trees under PRD tended to produce less than those of the other treatments. In 'Gala', fruit quality was similar for all treatments, whereas PRD and DI fruit of 'Fuji' were firmer and better colored than CI ones. This first year of observations suggests similar potential water savings without loss of yield and fruit quality using both PRD and DI irrigation strategies in 'Gala' and 'Fuji' apple orchards, although cumulative effects of deficit irrigation could preferentially penalize yields of 'Gala' trees under the climate of central Sicily...|$|E
40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the levels of}} urease activities (UA) and their relationships with soil physicochemical properties in salt-affected soils during reclamation, soil transects of a saline-sodic soil with different planting years under drip irrigation were intensively sampled. An enhanced soil UA in root zone (0 - 40 cm beneath <b>drip</b> <b>emitter)</b> was found as the planting years increased. In all transects, soil UA ranged from 0. 38 to 8. 53 mu g NH 4 +-N released g(- 1) dry soil h(- 1) at 37 degrees C, and showed a large spatial variability within transect. R- 2 of multiple regressions increased gradually with planting years, indicating that variations in UA could be better predicted after amelioration. Path analysis showed that the negative direct effects of soil pH on UA were clearly dominant, with the direct path coefficients of - 0. 357 similar to - 0. 666 (p < 0. 05). Soil organic matter yielded greater positive indirect path coefficients through pH and total nitrogen. An exponential relationship was found between soil UA and pH values (p < 0. 01). Our findings demonstrate that after the cultivation under drip irrigation for 3 years, soil biological activities and fertility level increased, with the decrease of soil salinity and sodicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{of available}} farmland makes saline soil a valuable alternative land sources for agriculture in North West China. In {{order to obtain}} high yields and economic benefits, it is very stringent to develop suitable management procedures for farms to better cope with soil water moisture and salinity. A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of soil matric potential on waxy corn growth and water use under drip irrigation in saline soils of North West China in 2005. The experiment included five treatments, which controlled soil matric potential (SMP) at 20 cm depth immediately under emitter higher than - 5, - 10, - 15, - 20, - 25 kPa. There were significant differences among the five treatments on waxy corn growth. The higher the target SMP value was, the higher the yields of waxy corn. Plant height, stem circumference, LAI and above-ground biomass all increased with increasing of SMP value, but the highest irrigation water use efficiency was achieved with SMP of - 10 kPa. The SMP of - 10 kPa at 20 cm depth immediately under <b>drip</b> <b>emitter</b> {{can be used as}} an indicator for corn drip irrigation scheduling on saline soil in the and areas of North West China...|$|R

Instead of releasing water through tiny holes easily blocked by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using velocity to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 by Blass who partnered later (1964) with Kibbutz Hatzerim to create an irrigation company called Netafim. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface <b>drip</b> irrigation <b>emitter.</b>|$|R
