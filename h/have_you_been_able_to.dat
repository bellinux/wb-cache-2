Moreover, all loadings were positive; and significant loadings emerged for 34 of the 35 items on their respective factors (i.e., {{with the exception of}} the values/meaning item “To what extent <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> practice your religion in the way you would like”, p’s for factor loadings[*]<[*]. 05 or lower; details regarding items and factor loadings within each of the domains of inner wellbeing are available from the author upon request). Finally (and consistent with hypotheses), the seven-factor intercorrelated model provided a significantly better fit to the correlational data than did the one-factor model (reduction in chi-square from one-factor model to seven-factor intercorrelated model[*]=[*] 58.90; reduction in degrees of freedom from one-factor model to seven-factor intercorrelated model[*]=[*] 27, p[*]<[*]. 01). One caveat concerning internal consistency: Even taking into account the relatively small number of items per scale (see Nunnally & Bernstein [1994]), reliabilities were somewhat low across the scales (average Cronbach’s alpha[*]=[*]. 55; compare to the average Cronbach’s alpha of [...]. 61 that White et al. [2013], reported for their Time 2 sample in India). Nevertheless, results of the present study indicate that the seven-factor intercorrelated model that White et al. ([2013]) reported as yielding optimal fit for data among participants in rural India also yielded optimal fit for data among participants in rural Zambia. Although the seven-factor intercorrelated model should also fit data for individuals in developed nations (at least in principle), further work must be done concerning the generalisability of the model across individuals in developing and developed nations alike (see also White et al. [2012]). Nevertheless, results of White et al. ([2013]) and of the present study suggest that, at least among individuals in two developing nations, the seven-factor intercorrelated model of domains of inner wellbeing is valid.|$|E

40|$|Cue: When we {{talk about}} {{agricultural}} biotechnology, most people assume that we mean genetic modification - breeding new characteristics into plants and animals by manipulating their genes, sometimes even transferring genes from one species to another. This kind of biotechnology has raised fears among some about the damage that may result to the environment or to human health. However, other technologies are less controversial. For example, certain tissue culture techniques are already being used in African countries to genetically clean up planting material, such as seeds. In Kenya the National Federation of Agricultural Producers {{is involved in a}} project to supply clean planting material for traditional food crops in a number of pilot districts. The Federation?s Chief Executive, Mercy Karanja, explained to Eric Kadenge why she feels this kind of biotechnology is of great importance to small scale farmers. IN:		?Biotechnology is a science ?? OUT:		?? suffered very many problems. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 04 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mercy Karanja of the Kenya National Federation of Agricultural Producers. Transcript Karanja	Biotechnology is a science like any other and there is a place for science in our life so we must emphasise that biotechnology is trying to solve and give us solutions to some niche problems which we have. For example in the area of bananas, {{we had a lot of}} problems with nematodes. We couldn't get cleaning planting materials for bananas, so biotechnology has come in and given us a solution. So there is a space for biotechnology which is very critical and we have seen a lot of assistance especially to the small scale farmers through clean seed provision. That?s the main thing we have seen this far Kadenge	Other than bananas, do you have any other examples of crops that are being improved through the use of biotechnology? Karanja	Yes, we've done a lot of work in the sweet potato vines in Kakamega, improving the nutritive value of sweet potatoes and since it?s a staple food for the people in that region of this country, its very important that we are able to improve. That has happened and we are very grateful about that. There's also work on drought resistant maize and also maize that is also resistant to streak virus. I think these are some of the greatest breakthroughs we would ever be able to have in this country. Kadenge	<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get some of the feelings from the farmers about these whole developments? Karanja	Everything that has been done has come from the farmers. It was a study that was done. We went and found out what are the critical problems which are affecting farmers in different regions, and what was done is the key thing that the farmer requested. For example, the banana problem: the bananas were being wiped out by nematodes and now you can see livelihoods being transformed. So we have really documented very exciting cases. Exciting cases especially of bananas, citrus, cassava, and this is food for people, besides an income as food for the households. So all this work has been documented and we are very glad to see the kind of impact it has on the ground. Kadenge	Now if I was a small-scale farmer wondering if I should at all consider using some of these products, what reasons would you give me to do so? Karanja	I would only say where you have a real critical problem like you don't have good clean seed to plant for example like for cassava, go for what is available. It has been cleansed and the kind of biotechnology we are talking about is really the traditional biotechnology of tissue culture. It's not like developing a whole new plant all together, which is going on in other parts of the world. We are still very basically at the traditional level where it is not highly risky to develop the plants out of their own tissues. So we can't say we will not use biotechnology like has been tried to be done by some of the groups. We are saying, let us use it where we need it. We need our traditional seeds, we need biotechnology to solve these very peculiar problems we have of disease and drought, of unclean planting materials. So let?s get what we can use now and allow the scientists to continue doing research, to see whether there are some other side effects. Kadenge	Is there anything else that you would like to add? Karanja	Yes I would really urge our scientists to continue giving us the information because that is what is the problem. If the farmers are not informed and given the whole spectrum of information, then they are bound to be vulnerable to other people coming with different gospels. But what we need to be armed with is information of where we are, where we are going and what is happening. There's a lot more biotechnology going on in this country, let it be out there for public consumption so that people can be able to dialogue concerning it very honestly and very seriously. If we can have solutions for our traditional foods, that is what we need to build in this country so that people can have their sorghums and their millets and their cassavas and their sweet potatoes on the table. Then we are able to develop the agricultural sector which has suffered very many problems. End of Track.

40|$|Being {{heard on}} the world stage Cue: If {{international}} trade is like a boxing match, the World Trade Organisation, or WTO, would have to be the referee - keeping the fight clean and ensuring the rules are followed. And while many developing countries may often feel like a tiny David facing the developed world?s Goliath, WTO trade talks do give them the opportunity to make and influence trade agreements. Government delegations from around the world come to the WTO to fight their corner, {{and in the case of}} African countries, they are able to fight as a team, called the ?African Group?. Making sure that the voices of ordinary farmers are heard at such negotiations is a job that has been taken up by a number of NGOs. One of them is Action Aid, an organisation that offers both practical support to farmers, as well as lobbying for their interests. Mweni Kiio is the Food Rights Campaign co-ordinator at Action Aid Kenya. In our next report she tells Eric Kadenge about the kind of support her organisation is giving to Kenya?s farmers, and her passionate belief that farmers need to make their voices heard. IN:		?We have a two-pronged approach ? OUT:		?both nationally and internationally. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mweni Kiio of Action Aid Kenya, on the need for farmers? voices to be heard by policy makers. Transcript Kiio	We have a two-pronged approach. Our regional offices, that are working with farmers to provide for them some of the services that the government used to provide, like better seeds, or even working with the government to provide extension services. And also providing some kind of credit, in that we support their farmer groups so that they can be able to assist the farmer, to keep him in business. Then we also have the second bit which is the policy aspect, where we lobby for better policies. Like we have been challenging some of these policies under the WTO. That is, there is a certain agreement called ?Agreement on Agriculture? which we believe, if Kenya is to adopt everything that is in that agreement as it stands, then our farmers stand to lose more than to gain. So we are making some proposals within that agreement, that we hope will benefit the farmers by the end of the day. Because within that agreement there is a certain provision which says that a country should withdraw subsidies or domestic support to its farmers. Kenya has done that, but that is not the same case with developed countries, because developed countries are still carrying on with increasing their domestic support to their farmers. The most recent case is the US government, which just increased its support to its farmers. And by the end of the day, you find that farmers from developed countries are able to produce more cheaply than farmers from developing countries, and then they are able now to sell their products in the international markets, and products from developing countries cannot compete. Kadenge	And at the moment what progress <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make in this lobbying? Kiio	We have been working very closely with the Ministry of Trade, where we have shared our concerns. And the government delegation that actually represents Kenya in the negotiations in this ?Agreement on Agriculture?, they have taken in our views, and it?s part of their position, the Kenyan government position to the negotiations. And the beauty of it is that Kenya is not negotiating alone; it?s part of what they call the ?African group?. So in the negotiations under WTO, whatever concerns we have raised have been tabled through that group. And the greatest achievement, I think, is a proposal on what we call the ?development box?. Under the ?Agreement on Agriculture?, there are various boxes that are given, where governments are allowed to support their farmers. And what we did is look at all those boxes, and saw that there are some issues that are just relevant to developing countries, that have not been addressed in their available boxes; there are three of them. Now we are proposing a ?development box?, where we are saying, developing countries need to be allowed to support rural development initiatives and food security issues in their countries, because those are the kind of things that we are facing. And these are not issues that are of concern really to the developed countries, but we think they are of major concern to us. Kadenge	Now where would you like to see the small-scale farmer in future, as we try to battle this whole issue that is affecting them? Kiio	I would like to see the farmer in the forefront, advocating for his issues. I would like to see a farmer who is engaging the government actively, both at the local level, national level and international level, and instead of I speaking for the farmers, like it has been in the past, I would like to see the farmer doing it for himself, and being engaged in every decision-making process that affects him, by the end of the day. I would also like to see a strong farmer movement in this country, because I strongly believe by the end of the day that even now we are not listening to our farmers; they contribute very much to the economy - you know that agriculture is the backbone of this country - and it is only right to involve such important people in decision-making, because they are the only ones who really know the problems they are facing. And they are the only ones who can come up with the right solutions to solve their own problems. And decisions should not be made for them, both nationally and internationally. End of track. The Food Rights Campaign Co-ordinator for Action Aid Kenya explains the work that Action Aid is doing to ensure farmers? concerns are heard in World Trade Organisation negotiations. She also encourages farmers to be active in pursuing their interests at a national and international level...|$|E
