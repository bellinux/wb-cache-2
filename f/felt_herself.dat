5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E
25|$|White {{described}} the vision experience as involving {{a bright light}} which would surround her and she <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{in the presence of}} Jesus or angels who would show her events (historical and future) and places (on earth, in heaven, or other planets).|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth was {{strongly}} {{attached to her}} parents, especially to her mother, and was still a child {{in search of an}} identity of her own when an adult role with unusual obligations and restrictions was imposed upon her. She had no control in her new life and was unable to identify herself as both the spouse of the emperor and a young mother. As a result, she attempted to recreate her childhood with its lack of obligations. The only quality for which she <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> appreciated, and over which she had control, was her physical appearance, so she started cultivating this as the primary source of her self-esteem. Obsessively achievement-oriented and almost compulsively perfectionistic in her attitudes, she became a slave to her own beauty and image.|$|E
6000|$|The note of a sad {{irony in}} his words appealed to such indignation for him in Ellen as she never <b>felt</b> for <b>herself.</b> But she only said, [...] "I don't believe Poppa could take that in the wrong way if you told him." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cliff, in {{a costume}} quite simple, but {{as rich as}} her {{conscience}} would allow, <b>felt</b> within <b>herself</b> all the uplifting influence of her wealth, as she stepped forward to salute this lady who had always been so uplifted by her wealth.|$|R
60|$|The haughty {{young lady}} also blushed. She did not often blush; when she did, she <b>felt</b> angry with <b>herself.</b>|$|R
500|$|After the inquest was over, Emily Huskisson {{found two}} speeches in William Huskisson's jacket pocket, {{which he had}} been {{planning}} to deliver following the inaugural journey. The first was a brief tribute to James Watt, the inventor of the condensing steam engine, and to all that his invention had made possible. The second was a longer speech. It was marked [...] "to be burnt at my death", but as {{it was one of the}} last things her husband had written Emily Huskisson <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> unable to do so.|$|E
500|$|During this time, Ellet was a {{participant}} in a notorious scandal involving Edgar Allan Poe and Frances Sargent Osgood, {{both of whom were}} married to others. Accounts of the particulars of the scandal and the sequence of events differ. At the time, Poe was {{at the height of his}} fame, thanks to his work [...] "The Raven". A number of women in literary society sent him letters, including Ellet and Osgood. Some of the letters sent may have been flirtatious or amorous ones. Ellet also spent time with Poe discussing literary matters. It is possible that Ellet <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> in competition with Osgood for Poe's affections. During this time, Poe had written several poems to and about Osgood, including [...] "A Valentine".|$|E
500|$|Rank was {{important}} in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to have much, if anything, {{in common with the}} higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras. In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: [...] "I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled me, and I was in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me." [...] A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of Genji written after she joined Shōshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in c.1008 the well-known court poet Fujiwara no Kintō inquired after the [...] "Young Murasaki"—an allusion to the character named Murasaki in Genji—which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author.|$|E
60|$|She smiled sadly, {{as if she}} <b>felt</b> {{alone in}} <b>herself.</b> He caressed her cheek with his fingers, and kissed her.|$|R
60|$|She {{regretted it}} next {{moment when she}} saw Alton's face. It {{expressed}} subdued surprise, and the girl <b>felt</b> irritated with <b>herself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] The man disappeared, {{and after}} another {{interval}} Adeline came in. She showed the trepidation she <b>felt</b> at finding <b>herself</b> {{in the presence}} of an interviewer.|$|R
2500|$|The Phial of Dread {{was one of}} Ludlow's {{earliest}} magazine stories, {{published in}} October 1859. It is written as the journal of a chemist who is visited in his laboratory by the insane daughter of an acquaintance, who <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> pursued by Death. When {{she got to the}} lab, she immediately sought out some chemical with which she could kill herself: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{year later}} Father Adolphe Roulland (1870–1934) of the Society of Foreign Missions {{requested}} the same {{service of the}} Lisieux Carmel. Once more Thérèse was assigned the duties of spiritual sister. [...] "It is quite clear that Thérèse, {{in spite of all}} her reverence for the priestly office, in both cases <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be the teacher and the giver. It is she who consoles and warns, encourages and praises, answers questions, offers corroboration, and instructs the priests in the meaning of her little way".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the year}} after Christina's birth, Maria Eleonora was {{described}} as being {{in a state of}} hysteria owing to her husband's absences. In 1632 Gustavus Adolphus described his wife as being [...] "a very sick woman". There was some excuse for her; she had lost three babies and still <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> an isolated foreigner in a hostile land, even more so after 1627 when her brother joined Sweden's enemies. Meanwhile, her husband's life was constantly in danger when he was on campaign. In 1627 Gustavus Adolphus was both ill and wounded. Two years later he had a narrow escape at Stuhm.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the family}} is no more low than you are, Mr Balls," [...] objected Jessie Summers, who, being not very high <b>herself,</b> <b>felt</b> that the remark was {{slightly}} personal.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} understand, then nor thereafter, {{the ferocity of}} hate which went out against the poor defenseless woman. What had the woman done? She {{struggled}} over the problem. She <b>felt</b> in <b>herself</b> that terrible ceaseless urging. Her thoughts were not clear, they were still only raised figures in the web of organic thought, but she was accomplishing great conceptions.|$|R
60|$|The {{order was}} once more corrected. Joan had the {{consolation}} of witnessing the childish delight that came {{again into the}} foolish face; but <b>felt</b> angry with <b>herself</b> at her own weakness.|$|R
2500|$|Binchy, {{described}} as [...] "six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous", although she actually grew to 6'1", confided to Gay Byrne of The Late Late Show that, {{growing up in}} Dalkey, she never <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be attractive; [...] "as a plump girl I didn't start on an even footing to everyone else". After her mother's death, she expected to lead a life of spinsterhood, or as she expressed: [...] "I expected I would live at home, as I always did." [...] She continued, [...] "I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|A deeply {{religious}} person, Jessie Wallace Hughan was a committed pacifist {{who spent the}} whole of her life fighting the spread of militarism in America. Following the eruption of the First World War {{in the summer of}} 1914, Hughan <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> called to action. In 1915 she organized the Anti-Enlistment League, with a headquarters in her apartment. Hughan and her associates were able to gather the signatures of some 3,500 men to a declaration opposing military enlistment with a view to demonstrating to American political leaders the unpopularity of the European war. She was a devoted opponent of the coordinated [...] "Preparedness" [...] campaign which emerged across the nation in 1915 and 1916.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, under Freud's supervision, Helene began {{analyzing}} {{her first}} patient, Viktor Tausk, {{while at the}} same time Freud was analyzing Helene. After three months, upon Freud's request, Helene terminated Tausk's sessions. During her sessions with Freud, Helene reported 'falling in love with Freud.' She often <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be Freud's daughter, claiming that Freud had inspired and released her talents. Helene claimed, however, that Freud tended to focus [...] "too much on her identification with her father" [...] and her affair with Lieberman. In one analysis with Freud, Helene dreamt that she had both female and male organs. Through analysis with Freud, she discovered that her personality was largely determined by her [...] "childhood wish to be simultaneously [...] father's prettiest daughter and cleverest son." [...] After one year, Freud terminated Helene's analytic sessions, to instead work with the Wolf Man. Helene nevertheless was a brilliant clinician, who stood up to Freud and got away with it when she 'disagreed with him about her patients.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} come to her sooner!" [...] he confessed. [...] "I {{knew that she had}} not been well the week before; but I thought her slight attack was from the stomach. How could I dream of this! She assured me that she <b>felt</b> like <b>herself,</b> and the morning of my {{birthday}}"--he hesitated--"the morning of my birthday I was compelled to go to the bishop." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Merrifield {{was rather}} shocked, but she <b>felt</b> that she <b>herself</b> {{was in a}} glass house, was, in fact, keeping a {{literary}} daughter, so she only committed herself to, 'She is very young.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Brownlow made {{a sign of}} displeased acquiescence, so {{like his}} brother when Carey was a little impetuous or naughty, that she {{instantly}} <b>felt</b> shocked at <b>herself,</b> and faltered, [...] "I beg your pardon." ...|$|R
2500|$|Molotov and Hitler {{resumed their}} discussions the next morning. [...] Molotov {{demanded to know}} why German troops were occupying Finland, while Hitler replied that they were {{traveling}} through Finland to Norway and wondered whether the Soviets intended {{to go to war}} over Finland. While Hitler agreed that Finland was within the Soviets' sphere of influence, he also stressed that Germany had a legitimate wartime interest in Finland's nickel and wood supply and that any new conflict in the Baltics would lead to a severe strain in relations. [...] Molotov concluded that nothing good could come from further talks about Finland and stated that he saw no signs of any resumption of a Soviet-Finland conflict. According to Hitler, however, Molotov stated that [...] "Russia <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> again endangered by Finland, Russia should be able to liquidate Finland" [...] which for him [...] "was the first question which I found difficult to answer. But I could not do otherwise than refuse this".|$|E
2500|$|It {{also meant}} that Tyler <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be an {{outsider}} {{in the public schools}} she attended in Raleigh, a feeling that has followed her most of her life. [...] She believes that this sense of being an outsider has contributed to her becoming a writer: “I believe that any kind of setting-apart situation will do [...] [...] In my case, it was emerging from the commune…and trying to fit into the outside world.” Despite her lack of public schooling prior to age 11, Anne entered school academically well ahead of most of her classmates in Raleigh. [...] With access now to libraries, she discovered Eudora Welty, Gabriel García Márquez, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others. [...] Eudora Welty remains one of her favorite writers, and The Wide Net and Other Stories is one of her favorite books; she has called Welty “my crowning influence." [...] She credits Welty with showing her that books could be about the everyday details of life, not just about major events. [...] During her years at N. B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, she was inspired and encouraged by a remarkable English teacher, Phyllis Peacock. “Mrs. Peacock” had previously taught the writer Reynolds Price, under whom Tyler would later study at Duke University. [...] Peacock would also later teach the writer Armistead Maupin. [...] Seven years after high school, Tyler would dedicate her first published novel to “Mrs. Peacock, for everything you’ve done.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In Who Would Have Thought It?, the {{experience}} of Lola Medina, the supposed protagonist of the story, mirrors many aspects of Ruiz de Burton's own life. [...] The character of Lola is a daughter of an aristocratic Spanish family from Mexico, who is adopted by a respected New England doctor and taken to the East Coast. [...] Lola is well educated, perfectly fluent in Spanish and English, good mannered, yet disrespected by the doctor's Protestant, white family and friends. [...] Lola is ostracized due to her appearances. [...] As a child her skin had been tinted to disguise her as an Indian, setting her apart from the very white ruling New England class. [...] The doctor however, attempts to vouch for her, because he knows the truth of her background, and explains {{that she is not}} in fact [...] "other" [...] as her appearance suggests, but rather has [...] "pure Spanish blood" [...] of potentially royal lineage [...] and deserves to be treated with due respect. [...] In the conclusion of the novel, Lola Medina is sent away to Mexico to be with her family, suggesting that despite her belief and the belief of the educated doctor that she has legitimate right to be in the US, her true place is not there, but in Mexico. [...] In Ruiz de Burtons own life, she was married young to a respected East Coast Protestant man, yet always <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be an outsider in New England, despite her education, wealth, and European lineage. [...] Her appearance and name always gave her away.|$|E
6000|$|It would seem, however, {{that almost}} {{immediately}} after I left a change for the worse set in, of such a character that Jane <b>felt</b> within <b>herself</b> her last hour was at hand. Then {{it was that she}} ordered the nurse to write a telegram at her dictation. It was to Dr. Merchison, and ran: [...] "Come and see me at once, do not delay as I am dying.--Jane." ...|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} time, Bertha joined the party below. Her eyes looked heavy and {{her cheeks were}} flushed, but she assured Miss Haverley that she <b>felt</b> quite <b>herself</b> now, {{and that she was}} sure that the sea air would set her up altogether. The schooner was under way {{a quarter of an hour}} before the gun was fired, and sailed east, as the course was twice round the Nab and back.|$|R
60|$|To-night, however, she <b>herself</b> <b>felt</b> {{miserable and}} lonely {{and the voice}} that came to {{her out of the}} {{darkness}} of the narrow passage which leads to the Chapel of St. Pieter was peculiarly plaintive and sweet.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} not to perceive that Maggie <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> a child again.|$|E
60|$|And {{suddenly}} she <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> being propelled by that softness forward towards the stile.|$|E
60|$|His words {{disturbed}} her. She <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{being drawn}} {{under the shadow}} of some mystery.|$|E
60|$|Ella's {{loyalty to}} the object of her admiration could not endure to hear him ridiculed. 'He's a clever man!' she said, with a tremor in her gentle voice which she <b>herself</b> <b>felt</b> to be absurdly {{uncalled}} for.|$|R
6000|$|She stopped there. Now, {{when she}} saw him, and heard him, some perverse {{hesitation}} in her began to doubt him. Now, when it was too late, she weakly tried to put herself on her guard. What a decay of energy (she <b>felt</b> it <b>herself)</b> in the ready and resolute woman, equal to any emergency at other times! [...] "To what am I to attribute the favour of your visit?" [...] she resumed.|$|R
60|$|And Miriam, {{thinking}} he had assured himself, <b>felt</b> strong in <b>herself.</b> She always regarded that sudden coming upon {{him in the}} lane as a revelation. And this conversation remained graven in her mind {{as one of the}} letters of the law.|$|R
