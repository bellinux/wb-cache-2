Water resources constitute a basic factor that influences the quantity of rural production and consequently, the exploitation and their rational management play a decisive role to {{the economic development}} of region. The demand for irrigation water, which especially during the summer months is great. shows significant regional variations in water availability. The most important issue is that water resources are not sufficient, while a significant part of water volume leads, mainly during the winter months, unexploited to the sea. In order to overcome the water shortage, several <b>hydraulic</b> public <b>works</b> are implemented. The major <b>hydraulic</b> <b>work</b> is the diversion of the Acheloos river to Thessaly.

25|$|Due to {{the shift}} of {{agriculture}} from self-supporting production to highly intensified cropland systems {{there has been a}} total investment of the Vietnamese Government of ~125 trillion VND in irrigation infrastructure during the last four decades. The constructions built during that time include approximately 100 large to medium scale <b>hydraulic</b> <b>works.</b> Furthermore, there are more than 8000 other irrigation systems (e.g. reservoirs, weirs, irrigation and drainage gates and pumping stations). The main irrigation form used is paddy field irrigation. Whereas gravity irrigation is widely distributed in the Mekong region, in the Central North and coastal regions (3/5 of total irrigation schemes). Irrigation utilizing pumps (electric or with oil engines) is mainly located in the delta regions (~2/3 of total). The other irrigation forms are informal (non-governmental) systems like small private pumps or small gravity diversions. Other investments are made by foreign donors; both foreign and internal investments tend to concentrate on the upgrading and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes.|$|E

Olives and grapes had for long been popular products commonly praised; however, the vineyards and orchards had been devastated during the last Punic war; also they were intentionally left to ruin because their produce competed with that of Roman Italia.

The ancient writers Strabo (64 BC – c. 21 AD), Pliny (23 – c. 79 AD), and Josephus (37 – c. 95 AD) praised the quality of African wheat. The Baradas river valley was acclaimed as productive as the Nile. Later, when Egypt began to supplant Africa Province as the supplier of wheat to Rome, the grape and the olive began reappearing again in the fields of the province, {{toward the end of the}} 1st century.

A 350-mile long canal, with another 300 miles of branch lines, eventually stretched between the headworks in Hardwar and—after splitting into two branches at Nanau near Aligarh—the confluence with the Ganges at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) and with the Jumna (now Yamuna) mainstem at Etawah. The Ganges Canal, which required a total capital outlay of £2.15 million, was officially opened in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie.
