50|$|In the end Afro-Peruvians were {{relegated to}} heavy labor on {{sugarcane}} and rice plantations {{of the northern}} coast, or the vineyards and cotton fields of the southern coast.

Afro-Peruvians often exercised agency by using huido (translated as escape, flight) from haciendas and changing masters on their own initiative or joining the cimarrones (armed gangs of runaway slaves that formed small communities in the wilderness and raided travel merchants). The indigenous population were used to work in the silver mines, where they had more expert knowledge than West Africans or Spanish, even in the pre-Columbian eras.|$|R

50|$|The East India Company {{obtained}} {{a foothold in}} India in 1695 and from that start expanded the territory it controlled until it was the primary power in the subcontinent. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British Government nationalised the Company creating the British Raj. The Company lost all its administrative powers; its Indian possessions, including its armed forces, were {{taken over by the}} Crown pursuant to the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. A new British government department, the India Council, was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General <b>of</b> India <b>gained</b> <b>a</b> new <b>title</b> (Viceroy <b>of</b> India), and implemented the policies devised by the India council.

The Governor-General <b>of</b> India <b>gained</b> <b>a</b> new <b>title,</b> Viceroy <b>of</b> India, and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the Straits Settlements, became colonies in their own right.

The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.|$|R

40|$|In early 1840 New Zealand was {{annexed to}} the Australian colony of New South Wales and William Hobson became Lieutenant-Governor {{of the new}} dependency. One of Hobson's first {{priorities}} was to sort out who owned what land in New Zealand. Thus a Commission {{was set up to}} investigate the land claims. The first New Zealand Land Commission was established under the New South Wales Act, 4 Victoria No. 7 (August 1840) and three Commissioners were appointed. They began examining claims early in the following year. Part One of this thesis deals with the origins of the Commission, the legislation which governed its activities and the work of the Commissioners - notably the difficulties which they encountered and what they actually achieved. A separate Commission was set up in Britain to deal with the claims of the New Zealand Company which held that it had bought some 20, 000, 000 acres of land centring on the Cook Strait in 1839 and to which it had already sent hundreds of settlers by the end of 1840. William Spain, appointed the Commissioner to investigate the Company's claims, began work early in 1842. The second part of this thesis is concerned with how his work progressed - particularly in the face of determined opposition from the Company's local officials - and how the Company <b>gained</b> <b>a</b> <b>title</b> to much <b>of</b> the land it claimed under an agreement made with the British Government in November 1840, in spite of Spain's finding that the company's 1839 purchases were hardly purchases at all. The epilogue summarises the Commissions' achievements and outlines what was done in the following years to finally settle the Land Question...|$|R
