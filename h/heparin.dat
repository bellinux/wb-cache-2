5|$|HIT may be {{suspected}} if {{blood tests}} show a falling platelet count in someone receiving <b>heparin,</b> {{even if the}} <b>heparin</b> has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving <b>heparin</b> have a complete blood count (which includes a platelet count) {{on a regular basis}} while receiving <b>heparin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Heparin</b> occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests <b>heparin</b> may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against <b>heparin</b> when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to <b>heparin</b> {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to <b>heparin,</b> but the majority are found in people who are receiving <b>heparin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain <b>heparin,</b> antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The <b>heparin</b> pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for <b>heparin.</b> <b>Heparin,</b> therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the <b>heparin</b> moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, <b>heparin</b> is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of <b>Heparin</b> pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
40|$|As <b>heparins</b> are {{sometimes}} {{used to prevent}} equine laminitis, the interactions between equine neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO), unfractionated (UFH) and fractionated low molecular weight (LMWH) <b>heparins</b> and digital endothelium have been investigated. The effects of the <b>heparins</b> on purified equine MPO activity were tested by immunocapture followed by enzymatic detection. Endothelium-MPO interactions were assessed by measuring total and active MPO uptake by arterial and venous digital endothelial cells in culture {{with or without the}} addition of <b>heparins.</b> A dose-dependent MPO inhibition by UFH and LMWH was seen, with the greatest reduction in MPO activity noted with the highest concentration of LMWH. The MPO capture was greater in arterial cells, but <b>heparins</b> better inhibited MPO capture in venous cells. The activity of cell-bound MPO was almost completely suppressed by the <b>heparins,</b> and no differences were observed between UFH and LMWH. The results confirm the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>heparins</b> and allow {{a better understanding of the}} potential role of MPO in laminitis. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Warfarin and <b>heparins</b> are {{anticoagulant}} {{medications that}} require individualized dosing and intensive laboratory monitoring to avoid both serious bleeding and blood clots.

They are most commonly used in the prevention and treatment of blood clots. Anticoagulants have narrow therapeuti...|$|R
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated <b>heparin)</b> {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated <b>heparin,</b> but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated <b>heparin.</b> The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after <b>heparin</b> is first given; if someone has received <b>heparin</b> in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving <b>heparin</b> after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight <b>heparin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, low {{molecular}} weight <b>heparins</b> can also be chemoenzymatically synthesized from simple disaccharides.|$|R

40|$|Low-molecular-weight <b>heparins</b> {{are widely}} used for the {{prophylaxis}} and treatment of venous thromboembolism. However, they can induce adverse skin reactions. The most common reactions are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions at injection sites. Rare systemic reactions have been reported.

5|$|Usually, {{warfarin}} is avoided in {{the first}} trimester, and a low molecular weight <b>heparin</b> such as enoxaparin is substituted. With <b>heparin,</b> risk of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects. Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.|$|E
5|$|While <b>heparin</b> was {{discovered}} in the 1930s, HIT was not reported until the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|While <b>heparin</b> was {{introduced}} {{for clinical use}} in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with <b>heparin</b> was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features {{were the result of}} an immune process.|$|E
50|$|Lepirudin {{may be used}} as an {{anticoagulant}} when <b>heparins</b> (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight) are contraindicated {{because of}} heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.|$|R
30|$|Both UFH and LMWH {{attenuated}} {{the toxicity}} of histone H 3, in vivo {{as well as}} in vitro. The effects of <b>heparins</b> shown in ex vivo study were independent of their anticoagulant effect. The effects of UFH and LMWH were comparable in the present study. In contrast to the <b>heparins,</b> although argatroban suppressed the decrease of the WBC and platelet counts, it failed to exhibit any organ-protective effects.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heparins</b> are {{cleared by}} the kidneys, but {{studies have shown}} that dalteparin does not {{accumulate}} even if kidney function is reduced.|$|R
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of <b>heparin,</b> an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving <b>heparin</b> develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|The British {{gynecologist}} Stansfield {{is credited}} with the introduction, in 1942, of the just recently introduced anticoagulant <b>heparin</b> {{in the treatment of}} CVST in 1942. Clinical trials in the 1990s finally resolved the concern about using anticoagulants in most cases of CVST.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping <b>heparin</b> treatment, and both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent {{that will not}} reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and bivalirudin.|$|E

5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend <b>heparin</b> or low molecular weight <b>heparin</b> in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 Cochrane review {{found that}} using <b>heparin</b> in medical {{patients}} {{did not change}} {{the risk of death}} or pulmonary embolism. While its use decreased people's risks of DVTs, it also increased people's risks of major bleeding. The review thus recommended the need to balance risks and benefits.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without <b>heparin</b> and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E

There is mounting evidence regarding the physiological and therapeutic role of <b>heparins</b> {{in the establishment of}} normal gestation and as a modality for treatment and prevention of pregnancy complications.

5|$|In those {{receiving}} <b>heparin</b> {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started.

5|$|Prevention {{options for}} at-risk {{individuals}} include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression.

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{investigate}} the prevalence of administration problems with injection of low molecular weight <b>heparins</b> at home. Low molecular weight <b>heparins</b> have to be injected by patients who have undergone total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgery. Some patients might have difficulties with self-administration of low molecular weight <b>heparins.</b> Design and methods: A retrospective telephone interview was conducted among patients who had undergone total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgery {{in one of the}} three participating Dutch hospitals in 2008. Several questions were asked to measure health-care resource use and potential administration problems related to parenteral thromboprophylaxis. Results: 687 patients (response rate 87 %) were interviewed. A total of 511 (74 %) of these patients used parenteral thromboprophylaxis at home. Around 20 % of the patients that used parenteral thromboprophylaxis faced problems with self-administration. Home-care visits for parenteral administration problems were required in approximately one out of ten of these orthopaedic patients. Almost 60 % of all patients prefer oral above parenteral thromboprophylaxis. Conclusion: This study suggests that a small but non-negligible part of patients with total hip or total knee replacement experience problems with self-administration of parenteral thromboprophylaxis in the home setting. These patients might benefit from newer oral antithrombotic agents. Moreover it is likely that oral antithrombotic agents will be cost-saving among these patients compared to <b>heparins,</b> as costs of home-care for administration will be averted...|$|R
40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight <b>heparins</b> are complex polycomponent drugs that have recently become amenable to top-down analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Even using open source deconvolution software, DeconTools, and automatic structural assignment software, GlycReSoft, {{the comparison of}} two or more low {{molecular weight}} <b>heparins</b> is extremely time-consuming, taking about a week for an expert analyst and provides no guarantee of accuracy. Efficient data processing tools are required to improve analysis. This study uses the programming language of Microsoft Excel™ Visual Basic for Applications to extend its standard functionality for macro functions and specific mathematical modules for mass spectrometric data processing. The program developed enables the comparison of top-down analytical glycomics data on two or more low molecular weight <b>heparins.</b> The current study describes a new program, GlycCompSoft, which has a low error rate with good time efficiency in the automatic processing of large data sets. The experimental results based on three lots of Lovenox®, Clexane® and three generic enoxaparin samples show that the run time of GlycCompSoft decreases from 11 to 2 seconds when the data processed decreases from 18000 to 1500 rows...|$|R
