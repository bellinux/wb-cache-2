5|$|They were unpopular with sportsmen as {{the dark}} colours of the breed {{did not show}} up in hunting conditions, and the {{elongated}} and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Sussex Spaniel {{with the exception of the}} head itself.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the current}} systems have three {{different}} formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team {{in all parts of}} the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4–2–1–3 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 4–2–1–3.|$|E
25|$|The {{compliance}} {{component of}} a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) {{as well as the}} testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations. The financial component is <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> financial audit of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.|$|E

Black did however praise Pam's prank as well as Dwight himself, but concluded his review: [...] "A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh-out-loud moments than I'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7." [...] Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued [...] "Women's Appreciation", explaining that it [...] "felt <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes." [...] She thought the episode [...] "only came together" [...] once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.|$|E
500|$|Arcade Fire {{also contributed}} to the movie's {{original}} score, The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled [...] "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. [...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> futuristic anthem." ...|$|E

500|$|Mega Man X {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} time during the 22nd century (2120) and approximately 100 years after the original Mega Man series. A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers {{the ruins of a}} robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year diagnostic program to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply [...] "X". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first [...] "replicate android" [...] or [...] "Reploid", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as [...] "Mavericks" [...] by law-abiding citizens.|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{initially}} received {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who criticised the production's artificial sounds and viewed its music as inauthentic. William Mann of the London Times {{said that the}} album will [...] "be called gimmicky by people who want a record to sound <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> live performance", although he considered it to be [...] "teem with musical invention" [...] and added: [...] "Nice as Come Together and Harrison's Something are – they are minor pleasures {{in the context of}} the whole disc … Side Two is marvellous …" [...] Ed Ward of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "complicated instead of complex" [...] and felt that the Moog synthesizer [...] "disembodies and artificializes" [...] the band's sound, adding that they [...] "create a sound that could not possibly exist outside the studio". While he found the medley on side two to be their [...] "most impressive music" [...] since Rubber Soul, Nik Cohn of The New York Times said that, [...] "individually", the album's songs are [...] "nothing special". Albert Goldman of Life magazine wrote that Abbey Road [...] "is not one of the Beatles' great albums" [...] and, despite some [...] "lovely" [...] phrases and [...] "stirring" [...] segues, side two's suite [...] "seems symbolic of the Beatles' latest phase, which might be described as the round-the-clock production of disposable music effects".|$|E
500|$|Several of Creangă's {{characteristic}} novellas are {{infused with}} themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter {{and the army}} of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people. A defining story in this series is [...] "Dănilă Prepeleac", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls [...] "idiocy serving to initiate", or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, [...] "complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity." [...] The {{first part of the}} story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comedy play. In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils. Contrarily, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of mămăligă dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service. The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as stătut ("frowzy" [...] or [...] "lacking in freshness"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval. Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's [...] "most original manner of dealing with the fabulous", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's Kir Ianulea on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: [...] " [...] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible".|$|E

In this version, popular songwriter Harry von Tilzer was being interviewed about the area around 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, where many music publishers had their offices.

2500|$|In 1983, the T-55M and T-55AM tank upgrade {{program also}} added {{the ability to}} some tanks to fire the 9K116-1 Bastion guided missile system (NATO {{reporting}} name AT-10 Stabber), for long-range engagements of tanks and low-flying helicopters. [...] The anti-tank missile is encased in the 3UBK10-1 shell, which is handled, loaded, and fired <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conventional tank gun round. [...] 1.5 seconds after firing, a laser guidance window in {{the tail of the}} round is uncovered, and its rocket engine ignites to burn for up to six seconds, with a total missile flight time of up to 41 seconds.

2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> human being.

This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.|$|E
