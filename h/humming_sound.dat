Wau {{is a traditional}} form of kite-flying involving kites created with intricate designs. These kites can reach heights of nearly , and due to bamboo attachments create a <b>humming</b> <b>sound</b> when flown. Sepak takraw is {{a game in which}} a rattan ball is kept in the air without using hands. A traditional game played during the rice harvest season was throwing gasing, which are large tops weighing around , which are thrown by unfurling a rope and scooped off the ground while spinning. They are known to be able to spin for over an hour. Other sports are dragon dancing and dragon-boat racing. Malaysia's coastline is popular for scuba diving, sailing, and other water sports and activities. Whitewater rafting and trekking are also often done.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "bumblebee" [...] is a {{compound}} of [...] "bumble" [...] + [...] "bee"— [...] "bumble" [...] meaning to hum, buzz, drone, or move ineptly or flounderingly.

500|$|In Pennsylvania, a Boy Scout {{leader is}} {{killed in an}} {{apparent}} freak lightning incident after investigating a mysterious <b>humming</b> <b>sound.</b> His body is found floating above the ground, warranting the intervention of Agent Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons are unable to determine the cause of death. Satellites pick up another lightning event not far from the first, and Coulson, with Agents Melinda May and Grant Ward, arrives at the source to find a second body, floating like the first. Civilian hacker and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye discovers that the two victims were both volunteer firefighters from the same station who responded to the Battle of New York.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the night, {{the four}} Beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an {{extended}} <b>humming</b> <b>sound</b> to close the song – an idea that they later discarded. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the tapes from this 10 February orchestral session reveal the guests breaking into loud applause following the second orchestral passage. Among the EMI staff attending the event, one recalled how Ron Richards, the Hollies' producer, was stunned by the music he had heard; in Lewisohn's description, Richards [...] " [...] with his head in his hands, saying 'I just can't believe it … I give up.'" [...] Martin later offered his own opinion of the orchestral session: [...] "part of me said 'We're being a bit self-indulgent here.' The other part of me said 'It's bloody marvellous!'" ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the firehouse}} they {{discover}} a third firefighter, Tony Diaz, who {{can hear a}} strange <b>humming</b> <b>sound.</b> Satellites pick up a third electrical event at the firehouse, as May discovers a Chitauri helmet in Diaz's possession—a souvenir from the Battle of New York. Diaz and the other victims had been cleaning 'rust' from the helmet several nights earlier, and Simmons deduces {{that they were all}} infected with an alien virus. Coulson helps Diaz come to terms with his situation, before leaving him to die. Aboard the Bus (the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base) the team are transporting the helmet to the Sandbox, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, when Coulson realizes that Simmons has been infected as well. She gives herself only 2 hours to live, but the plane is above the Atlantic Ocean and at least 3 hours from land. Agent Felix Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters orders Coulson to dump her off the plane rather than risk the safety {{of the rest of the}} team, but Coulson refuses. Rather than let the rest of the team die, Simmons jumps out of the plane herself; moments later, Fitz discovers an antidote for the virus. Ward jumps after her with a parachute and the cure, saving her life.|$|E
500|$|In some species, for example, either remiges or rectrices {{make a sound}} during flight. [...] These {{sounds are}} most often {{associated}} with courtship or territorial displays. The outer primaries of male broad-tailed hummingbirds produce a distinctive high-pitched trill, both in direct flight and in power-dives during courtship displays; this trill is diminished when the outer primaries are worn, and absent when those feathers have been moulted. [...] During the northern lapwing's zigzagging display flight, the bird's outer primaries produce a <b>humming</b> <b>sound.</b> [...] The outer primaries of the male American woodcock are shorter and slightly narrower {{than those of the}} female, and are likely the source of the whistling and twittering sounds made during his courtship display flights. [...] Male club-winged manakins use modified secondaries to make a clear trilling courtship call. [...] A curve-tipped secondary on each wing is dragged against an adjacent ridged secondary at high speeds (as many as 110 times per second—slightly faster than a hummingbird's wingbeat) to create a stridulation much like that produced by some insects. Both Wilson's and common snipe have modified outer tail feathers which make noise when they are spread during the birds' roller coaster display flights; as the bird dives, wind flows through the modified feathers and creates a series of rising and falling notes, which is known as [...] "winnowing". [...] Differences between the sounds produced by these two former conspecific subspecies—and the fact that the outer two pairs of rectrices in Wilson's snipe are modified, while only the single outermost pair are modified in common snipe—were among the characteristics used to justify their splitting into two distinct and separate species.|$|E
500|$|Though {{previous}} Steely Dan {{projects were}} often recorded live, Fagen opted to overdub each part separately for The Nightfly. It became enormously difficult, between this approach {{and the new}} technology, to record the album. Pianist Michael Omartian [...] "objected strongly" [...] when Fagen tasked him to [...] "set the groove" [...] of the title track on his own, with nothing but a click track. On another occasion, Fagen [...] "demanded subtle timing differences between the left and right-hand piano parts" [...] on [...] "Ruby Baby". The effect he desired was achieved with Omartian and Greg Phillinganes playing together on the same keyboard. For the [...] "party noises" [...] in [...] "Ruby Baby", the team suspended a microphone from the ceiling of Studio 54 – just {{next door to the}} studio they were working – and recorded one of Jerry Rubin's 'business parties.' Unsatisfied with the results, the group instead held a party in the studio by themselves and included that ambience in the song. Larry Carlton performs lead guitar on much of the album, and recorded his pieces in four days. During his time with the group, he discovered a <b>humming</b> <b>sound</b> coming from his amplifier. The engineers discovered the source {{on the outside of the}} building: a large magnet [...] "that formed part of the New York subway system." [...] In one instance, a strange smell permeated the studio space at Soundworks. The studio staff [...] "gutted" [...] the studio, removing its air conditioning, carpeting, and recording console until they discovered the cause of the smell: a deceased rat in a drainpipe. Sessions often stretched long into the evening; Fagen would often refer to this as [...] "being on the night train." [...] In the end, the album took eight months to record, and was mixed in 10 days.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Gibson looked {{to create a}} new guitar pickup {{different}} from existing popular single coil designs. Gibson had already developed the Charlie Christian pickup and P-90 in the 1930s and 40s; however, these designs—like competitor Fender's single-coil pickups—were fraught with inherent 60-cycle <b>hum</b> <b>sound</b> interference. Engineer and Gibson employee Seth Lover spent much of 1954 working on a noise-cancelling or [...] "hum-bucking" [...] guitar pickup design. By early 1955, the design was completed. In June 1955, Lover and Gibson filed a joint patent for the pickup design.|$|R
5000|$|Double-coil or [...] "humbucker" [...] pickups {{were invented}} {{as a way}} to reduce or counter the {{unwanted}} ambient <b>hum</b> <b>sounds</b> (known as 60-cycle hum). Humbuckers have two coils of opposite magnetic and electric polarity to produce a differential signal. Electromagnetic noise that hits both coils equally tries to drive the pickup signal toward positive on one coil and toward negative on the other, which cancels out the noise. The two coils are wired in phase, so their signal adds together. This high combined inductance of the two coils leads to the richer, [...] "fatter" [...] tone associated with humbucking pickups.|$|R

30|$|Returning to our FA user, John, he has {{problems}} using a full-size keyboard, but cannot use most hands-free alternatives either. The most important example is speech recognition. Due to dysarthria, {{the variability in}} his speech is too large for recognition software. The problem for an algorithm to learn John’s phonemic patterns is exacerbated by the difficulty he experiences to produce <b>humming</b> <b>sounds.</b> The generation of such para-language is required for using NVVI, (Non-Verbal Vocal Interaction) [26]–[29]. A secondary symptom that John experiences is a pathological nystagmus, which causes his eye movements to be rather unusual. In contrast to physiological nystagmus, pathological nystagmus causes drift of retinal images and degraded vision for lack of compensatory eye movements [30]. In summary, John experiences involuntary eye movements and reduced ocular muscle control, which {{is a combination of}} symptoms that obviously renders eye tracking approaches unusable.|$|R
