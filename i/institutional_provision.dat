A devotee of the work of Michel Foucault, his research extended and localised Foucault's history of madness to England and Wales. Over a decade in the writing his major work was published by a minor press in Wales as A Geographical History of <b>Institutional</b> <b>Provision</b> for the Insane from Medieval Times to the 1860s in England and Wales: The Space Reserved for Insanity. Always a generous collaborator, he has co-edited numerous general anthologies of human geography. Most recently, he has examined, with Eric Laurier, cafe culture in Glasgow.|$|E
40|$|International {{agreements}} governing rivers {{vary considerably}} in whether they contain <b>institutional</b> <b>provisions</b> for joint monitoring, conflict resolution, enforcement, and/or the {{delegation of authority}} to intergovernmental organizations. This article develops an explanation for why some river management treaties include more <b>institutional</b> <b>provisions</b> while others contain fewer, if any. The authors argue that certain types of issues related to river use—water quantity, water quality, and navigation—tend {{to be difficult to}} manage and prone to noncompliance. When forming treaties to address these specific issues, states {{will be more likely to}} include <b>institutional</b> <b>provisions.</b> The authors test the link between these river use issues and institutional design using a data set of 315 river treaties signed since 1950. The results show that highly contentious issues—and in particular water quantity and navigation—have a greater effect on the institutional design of river treaties than contextual and power politics factors. cooperation, conflict, water, international institutions, transboundary rivers...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth-century there was minimal specialist <b>institutional</b> <b>provision</b> for those deemed insane in Ireland. The lunatic department of the House of Industry, which in 1809 had forty-six cells reserved for this population, was heavily over-subscribed as individuals were sent there from throughout Ireland. Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of £2,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed. It officially opened as the Richmond Lunatic Asylum in 1815 with 250 beds, although it had received its first patients from the lunatic wards of the House of Industry in the previous year. It was named after Charles Lennox who was the Duke of Richmond and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1807-1813). Initially, it was established as a national asylum to receive curable lunatics from throughout the island of Ireland. From 1830, however, it was incorporated into the district asylum system. Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of Wicklow, Louth, Meath, and the town of Drogheda.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} basis {{of land management}} {{at the local level}} has already been sufficiently worked out, but {{it can be argued that}} they have not yet been finally resolved with regard to <b>institutional</b> <b>provision.</b> Therefore, it is expedient to propose an author's vision regarding the essential definition of this concept. In the classical form, this term was used many decades ago and literally meant the "foundation", "the foundation". It has been established that balanced development of land management as a mechanism for the development of the socio-economic, ecological and legal system of land use in the respective territory is ensured by interaction between the whole set of conditions and factors that can be grouped according to qualitative characteristics in six blocks: 1) needs, development goals, developmental tasks; 2) innovations in the development of land management and land management NTP for land use development; 3) state land policy, land policy of territorial communities; organizational structure of the land management system; 4) normative-legal infrastructure; 5) mentality, culture, public consciousness; 6) economic mechanism, system of social and economic development. <b>Institutional</b> <b>provision</b> of balanced development of land management and land management of territories of territorial communities is possible only if it is possible to achieve the coherence and complementarity of all six blocks and the unidirectionality of their development. <b>Institutional</b> <b>provision</b> of land management and land management at the local level is a set of social interests, elements, actions and institutions aimed at building land relations and land system systems that ensure the harmonious functioning of land use at the local and other hierarchical levels of economic development of the respective territories.

40|$|From Introduction: By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century <b>institutional</b> <b>provision</b> for a wide range of {{objectives}} was well-established in Scotland as it was across much of Europe and beyond. While adults were often the initial focus of such provision, specialist institutions for children were also established. However, for disabled children, their introduction might be regarded as haphazard. <b>Institutional</b> <b>provision</b> for hearing impaired children can be traced to 1760, but institutional intervention did not occur for children with physical disabilities until 1874. Institutions for disabled children developed in a context where Scotland’s growing population was gravitating towards the industrialising cities. It was also an era when the ‘rational’ body, and mind, became of concern to ‘respectable’ middle class society while the rise in stature of the medical profession resulted in the ‘imperfect’ body and mind being viewed as defects requiring repair. As ‘disability’ was a collective circumstance constructed in the twentieth century, the uncoordinated development of the preceding century is understandable. In the language of the nineteenth century, the needs and circumstances of a ‘blind’ child were regarded as quite different from those of an ‘idiot’ or ‘imbecile’ child, and a ‘deaf and dumb’ child was not seen as having anything in common with a child who was ‘lame’, ‘crippled’ or bedridden with joint disease. Institutions for disabled children were established with a variety of objectives, including education and training, medical intervention and custodial confinement. The application of the residential institutional option to different types of disablement in childhood was an erratic process lasting more than a century. This paper will begin by exploring the fragmented approach to <b>institutional</b> <b>provision</b> for disabled children in Scotland. The aims of institutions in providing education, training and employment will then be examined along with their roles in providing moral and religious inculcation and facilitating medical intervention. Finally, the objectives of the supporters and administrators of institutions will be discussed, but tempered by some first han...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Catholic {{case study in}} a field {{dominated}} by studies on Protestant migrants. One of the main differences between the confessions was the <b>institutional</b> <b>provision</b> for the liturgical and devotional lives of laity abroad. Catholics did not found separate institutions similar to Protestant exile churches which channelled the sense of belonging and internal cohesion of Protestant migrants. However, <b>institutional</b> <b>provision</b> {{was not the only}} way of maintaining cohesion as a group. Informal bonds, and communal understanding played an equally important part in fostering and preserving group identity. This essay discusses how the English Catholic community abroad retained a sense of belonging while geographically and ecclesiologically within the Catholic Church on the Continent. It uses William Christian's 'local religion' as tool to explore the tensions and understandings between the particular and universal aspects of Catholicism. Did 'local religion' change shape, meaning, and importance {{in the context of an}} expatriate community? Was ‘local religion’ really 'localised', or could we look at a wide geographical framework? How did expatriates relate their devotional lives to their home country? Focusing veneration of English saints, this essay explores how this maintained, and gave a particular shape to the English Catholic community within the universal Church. It pieces together records from English families, religious foundations, and local authorities, preserved in Belgium, France, and England. Thereby, a community comes to light which was less visible than clearly defined Protestant exile churches, but which offers insights in the development of confessional mobility and early modern Catholicism...|$|E
