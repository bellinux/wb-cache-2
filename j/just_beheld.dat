60|$|He {{was about}} to put some unconsidered {{question}} to her, but she half-anticipated it by bidding him, in a low, but nevertheless almost authoritative tone, not to make any allusion to the scene he had <b>just</b> <b>beheld.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Masilo,' he said, as {{he entered}} the hut, 'I have <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> your wife near the river with a girl who must be your daughter, she is so like you. We have been deceived, for we all thought she was dead.' ...|$|E
60|$|Richard <b>just</b> then <b>beheld</b> {{a person}} from whose {{interposition}} he had much greater hopes, namely the Earl of Gloucester, who, though still a young man, was the chief English noble in the camp, and whose special charge the Saracen captives were. He hurried towards him, and asked tidings of the Prince.|$|R
60|$|They walked briskly on {{for an hour}} or two, {{for even}} little Button-Bright was a good walker and did not tire easily. At length as they turned a curve in the road they <b>beheld</b> <b>just</b> before them a curious sight.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had he {{uttered the}} words when a sound from {{overhead}} caught his ear. He cast up his eyes, and lo! by the expiring {{light of the}} fire he <b>beheld,</b> <b>just</b> over the disk of the rock, {{what appeared to be}} the grim visage of the drowned buccaneer, grinning hideously down upon him.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{were the}} notes thy once-loved Poet sung, Till Death {{untimely}} stopp'd his tuneful tongue. Oh <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> and lost! admired and mourn'd! With softest manners, gentlest arts adorn'd! Blest in each science, blest in every strain! Dear to the Muse! to Harley dear--in vain! ...|$|E
60|$|So when Sir Percival came {{forth from}} that hall, {{all those who}} beheld him were {{astonished}} at the great peace and calmness that appeared to emanate from him. But he told no one of that miraculous vision which he had <b>just</b> <b>beheld,</b> and, though it appeareth {{in the history of}} these things, yet it was not then made manifest.|$|E
60|$|I mused so {{long and}} deep on these things, that the thought which might have helped me came to me too late, namely, to tell all my tale to the Maiden herself, and throw me on her mercy. Nay, even when at last and late this light shone on my mind, I had shame to speak to her, {{considering}} the marvellous thing which I had <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> of her, in the fulfilment of her prophecy. But now my master's house was in sight, at the turning from the steep stairs and the wynd, and there stood Elliot on the doorstep, watching {{and waiting for the}} Maid, as a girl may wait for her lover coming from the wars.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it would suit anybody," [...] {{declared}} Spouter. [...] "Why, this whole surroundings has the most artistic setting I ever <b>beheld.</b> <b>Just</b> think of this rustic bungalow nestling away {{in the midst of}} this gigantic forest, and think of this deep-throated fireplace with the flames soaring upward, casting their flickering shadows hither and thither over the bright faces--" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{the ranks}} of {{military}} men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes were turned towards {{the point where the}} minister was seen to approach among them. The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph! The energy--or say, rather, the inspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that had brought its own strength along with it from heaven--was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office. The glow, which they had <b>just</b> before <b>beheld</b> burning on his cheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers. It seemed hardly the face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue: it was hardly a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervously, yet tottered, and did not fall! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Just</b> then he <b>beheld</b> [...] "plain Mr. Jones" [...] and his {{secretary}} with the ambiguous name of Ricardo entering {{the grounds of}} the hotel. They had been down to the port on some business, and now were returning; Mr. Jones lank, spare, opening his long legs with angular regularity like a pair of compasses, the other stepping out briskly by his side. Conviction entered Schomberg's heart. They were two desperadoes--no doubt about it. But as the funk which he experienced was merely a general sensation, he managed to put on his most severe Officer-of-the-Reserve manner, long before they had closed with him.|$|R
6000|$|Zack {{was really}} a good mimic; and he now hit off all the peculiarities of Mrs. Peckover's voice, manner, and gait to the life--Mat chuckling all the while, rolling his huge {{head from side to}} side, and {{striking}} his heavy fist applaudingly on the table. Encouraged by the extraordinary effect his performances produced, Zack went through the whole of his scene with Mrs. Peckover in the passage, from beginning to end; following that excellent woman through all the various mazes of [...] "rhodomontade" [...] in which she then bewildered herself, and imitating her terror when he threatened to run upstairs and ask Mr. Blyth if Madonna really had a hair bracelet, with such amazing accuracy and humor, as made Mat declare that what he had <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> for nothing, would cure him of ever paying money again to see any regular play-acting as long as he lived.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the manner}} of one who has <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> a two-headed calf they {{repeated}} that they had [...] "never HEARD such funny ideas!" [...] They were staggered to learn that a real tangible person, living in Minnesota, and married to their own flesh-and-blood relation, could apparently believe that divorce {{may not always be}} immoral; that illegitimate children do not bear any special and guaranteed form of curse; that there are ethical authorities outside of the Hebrew Bible; that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter; that the capitalistic system of distribution and the Baptist wedding-ceremony were not known in the Garden of Eden; that mushrooms are as edible as corn-beef hash; that the word [...] "dude" [...] is no longer frequently used; that there are Ministers of the Gospel who accept evolution; that some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always vote the Republican ticket straight; {{that it is not a}} universal custom to wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter; that a violin is not inherently more immoral than a chapel organ; that some poets do not have long hair; and that Jews are not always pedlers or pants-makers.|$|E
6000|$|The Judge {{followed}} his cousin from the shop, where the foregoing conversation had passed, into the parlor, and flung himself heavily {{into the great}} ancestral chair. Many a former Pyncheon had found repose in its capacious arms: rosy children, after their sports; young men, dreamy with love; grown men, weary with cares; old men, burdened with winters,--they had mused, and slumbered, and departed to a yet profounder sleep. It {{had been a long}} tradition, though a doubtful one, that this was the very chair, seated in which the earliest of the Judge's New England forefathers--he whose picture still hung upon the wall--had given a dead man's silent and stern reception to the throng of distinguished guests. From that hour of evil omen until the present, it may be,--though we know not the secret of his heart,--but it may be that no wearier and sadder man had ever sunk into the chair than this same Judge Pyncheon, whom we have <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> so immitigably hard and resolute. Surely, it must have been at no slight cost that he had thus fortified his soul with iron. Such calmness is a mightier effort than the violence of weaker men. And there was yet a heavy task for him to do. Was it a little matter--a trifle to be prepared for in a single moment, and to be rested from in another moment,--that he must now, after thirty years, encounter a kinsman risen from a living tomb, and wrench a secret from him, or else consign him to a living tomb again? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'America!' We {{must have}} 'America!' Pipe up, Ed, {{this is too}} good to end without one song more," [...] cried Mr. Burton, who had been singing like a trumpet; and, hardly waiting to get their breath, off they all went again with the {{national}} hymn, singing as they never had sung it before, for somehow the little scenes they had <b>just</b> acted or <b>beheld</b> seemed to show how much this dear America of ours had cost {{in more than one}} revolution, how full of courage, energy, and virtue it was in spite of all its faults, and what a privilege, as well as duty, it was for each to do his part toward its safety and its honor in the present, as did those brave {{men and women in the}} past.|$|R
60|$|One afternoon, {{seeing him}} tired {{of play and}} hard to amuse, she took him {{in her arms and}} carried him right {{up the side of the}} {{mountain}}, where it grew so steep that even the big cat could not follow them. Finally she brought him out on the extreme summit, and looking round he seemed to see the whole world spread out beneath him. Below, half-way down, there were some wild cattle feeding on the mountain side, and they looked at that distance no bigger than mice. Looking eastwards he <b>beheld</b> <b>just</b> beyond the plain a vast expanse of blue water extending leagues and leagues away until it faded into the blue sky. He shouted with joy when he saw it, and could not take his eyes from this wonderful world of water.|$|R
60|$|Poor Benjy! {{he became}} half-mad with {{excitement}} at last. The exaltation {{of his little}} spirit at the risky neck-or-nothing dash, coupled with horror at the certainty of a terrible climax, was almost too much for him. He gave vent to his feelings in a wild cheer or yell, and, <b>just</b> then, <b>beheld</b> an iceberg of unusual size, looming up on the horizon before him. Knowing by experience that he would soon be up to it, he used his pole with all his might, hoping {{to steer clear of}} it. As he drew nearer, he saw a dark line {{on either side of the}} berg. A feeling of deadly alarm filled him. It was the open sea! and he had to choose between being plunged into it or dashed against the berg. It occurred to him then, for the first time, that a third resource was open--he might cut the rope, and let the kite go free! Amazed at his stupidity in not thinking of this before, he took out his clasp-knife, but before applying it, made a last effort to move the regulator. Strange to say, the silken cord yielded to the first pull, as if nothing had been wrong with it at all! The head of the runaway kite was thrown forward, and it came wavering down in eccentric gyrations, while the sledge gradually lost way, and came to a standstill not fifty yards from the berg.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My birth, my parents, my education, my ancient abode--these I {{will not}} disclose,' {{interrupted}} the Pagan, raising one arm authoritatively, {{as if to}} obstruct Vetranio from approaching the door. 'I have sworn by my gods, that until the day of restitution these secrets of my past life shall remain unrevealed to strangers' ears. Unknown I entered Rome, and unknown I will labour in Rome until the projects I have lived for are crowned with success! It is enough that I confess to you that with those sacred images whose fragments you have <b>just</b> <b>beheld,</b> I was once lodged; that those sacred vestments whose remains you discerned at your feet, I once wore. To attain the glories of the priesthood {{there was nothing that}} I did not resign, to preserve them there was nothing I did not perform, to recover them there is nothing that I will not attempt! I was once illustrious, prosperous, beloved; of my glory, my happiness, my popularity, the Christians have robbed me, and I will yet live to requite it heavily at their hands! I had a guardian who loved me in my youth; the Christians murdered him! A temple was under the rule of my manhood; the Christians destroyed it! The people of a whole nation once listened to my voice; the Christians have dispersed them! The wise, the great, the beautiful, the good, were once devoted to me; the Christians have made me a stranger at their doors, and outcast of their affections and thoughts! For all this shall I take no vengeance? Shall I not plot to rebuild my ruined temple, and win back, in my age, the honours that adorned me in my youth?' ...|$|E
60|$|At San Pablo she {{was staying}} with her sister, whose actual spouse—she too had been divorced—the {{principal}} man of the place, kept a bank (with {{the aid of a}} six-shooter), and who had never suffered Nancy to want for a home during her unattached periods. Nancy had begun very young; she must be about thirty-seven to-day. That was all he meant by her not being respectable. Her chronology was rather mixed; her sister at least had once told him that there was one winter when she didn’t know herself who was Nancy’s husband. She had gone in mainly for editors—she esteemed the journalistic profession. They must all have been dreadful ruffians, for her own amiability was manifest. It was well known that whatever she had done she had done in self-defence. In fine she had done things—that was the main point now. She had been as pretty as could still be seen, and as good-natured and as clever as could likewise be yet measured; she had been quite the best company in those parts. She was a genuine product of the wild West—a flower of the Pacific slope; ignorant, absurd, crude, but full of pluck and spirit, of natural intelligence and of a certain intermittent haphazard felicity of impulse. She used to sigh that she only wanted a chance—apparently she had found that now. At one time, without her, he didn’t see how he could have put up with the life. He had started a cattle-ranch, to which San Pablo was the nearest town, and he used to ride over to see her. Sometimes he stayed there a week; then he went to see her every evening. It was infernally hot; they used to sit on the back piazza. She was always as attractive and very nearly as well-dressed as they had <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> her. As far as appearance went she might have been transplanted at an hour’s notice from that dusty old settlement to the city by the Seine.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through the}} massive {{entrance}} gates, crossing the vast {{hall of the}} Imperial abode, with its statues, its marbles, and its guards in attendance, and thence ascending the noble staircase, the first object that might on this occasion have attracted the observer, when he gained the approaches to the private apartments, was a door at an extremity of the corridor, richly carved and standing half open. At this spot were grouped some fifteen or twenty individuals, who conversed by signs, and maintained in all their movements the most decorous and complete silence. Sometimes one of the party stole on tiptoe to the door, and looked cautiously through, returning almost instantaneously, and expressing to his next neighbour, by various grimaces, his immense interest in the sight he had <b>just</b> <b>beheld.</b> Occasionally there came from this mysterious chamber sounds resembling the cackling of poultry, varied now and then by a noise like the falling of a shower of small, light substances upon a hard floor. Whenever these sounds were audible, {{the members of the}} party outside the door looked round upon each other and smiled--some sarcastically, some triumphantly. A few among these patient expectants grasped rolls of vellum in their hands; the rest held nosegays of rare flowers, or supported in their arms small statues and pictures in mosaic. Of their number, some were painters and poets, some orators and philosophers, and some statuaries and musicians. Among such a motley assemblage of professions, remarkable in all ages of the world for fostering in their votaries the vice of irritability, it may seem strange that so quiet and orderly a behaviour should exist as that just described. But it is to be observed that in attending at the palace, these men of genius made sure at least of outward unanimity among their ranks, by coming equally prepared with one accomplishment, and equally animated by one hope: they waited to employ a common agent--flattery; to attain a common end--gain.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{more than}} the mare's milk; which foaled him," [...] {{answered}} the artist, and was proceeding to dilate on the excellence of his recipe when he was interrupted by an explosion as loud and tremendous as the mine which blows up the rampart of a beleaguered city. The horses started, and the riders were equally surprised. They turned to gaze in the direction from which the thunder-clap was heard, and <b>beheld,</b> <b>just</b> over the spot they had left so recently, a huge pillar of dark smoke rising high into the clear, blue atmosphere. [...] "My habitation is gone to wreck," [...] said Wayland, immediately conjecturing {{the cause of the}} explosion. [...] "I was a fool to mention the doctor's kind intentions towards my mansion before that limb of mischief, Flibbertigibbet; I might have guessed he would long to put so rare a frolic into execution. But let us hasten on, for the sound will collect the country to the spot." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{understood}} the metaphor at once, though, indeed, {{it would not}} much have troubled me if she had assented to the literal meaning of my words. The mahogany box {{was placed in a}} proper position, and I peeped in through its small round magnifying-window while the girl sat by my side and gave short descriptive sketches as one after another the pictures were unfolded to my view. We visited together--at least, our imaginations did--full many a famous city in the streets of which I had long yearned to tread. Once, I remember, we were in the harbor of Barcelona, gazing townward; next, she bore me through the air to Sicily and bade me look up at blazing Ætna; then we took wing to Venice and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the Rialto, and anon she set me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of Napoleon. But there was one scene--its locality she could not tell--which charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and churches, because the fancy haunted me that I myself the preceding summer had <b>beheld</b> <b>just</b> such a humble meeting-house, in just such a pine-surrounded nook, among our own green mountains. All these pictures were tolerably executed, though far inferior to the girl's touches of description; nor was it easy to comprehend how in so few sentences, and these, as I supposed, in a language foreign to her, she contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene.|$|R

6000|$|Don't imagine for {{a moment}} that I don't feel the full horror of my having had to wait till now, when I can avail myself of this aid, to acknowledge, as the poor pale pettifogging term has it, the receipt from you of inexpressibly splendid bounties. I won't attempt to explain or expatiate--about this abject failure of utterance: the idea of [...] "explaining" [...] {{anything}} to you in these days, or of any expatiation that isn't exclusively that of your own genius upon your own adventures and impressions! I think the reason why I have been so baffled, in a word, is that all my powers of being anything else have gone to living upon your two magnificent letters, the one from Verdun, and the one after your second visit there; which gave me matter of experience and appropriation to which I have done the fullest honour. Your whole record is sublime, and the interest and the beauty and the terror of it all have again and again called me back to it. I have ventured to share it, {{for the good of the}} cause and the glory of the connection (mine,) with two or three select others--this I candidly confess to you--one of whom was dear Howard, absolutely as dear as ever through everything, and whom I all but reduced to floods of tears, tears of understanding and sympathy. I know them at last, your incomparable pages, by heart--and thus it is really that I feel qualified to speak to you of them. With the two sublimities in question, or between them, came of course also the couple of other favours, enclosing me, pressing back upon me, my attempted contribution to your Paris labour: to which perversity I have had to bow my head. I was very sorry to be so forced, but even while cursing and gnashing my teeth I got your post-office order cashed, and the money is, God knows, assistingly spendable here! Another pang was your mention of Jean du Breuil's death.... I didn't know him, had never seen him; but your account of the admirable manner of his end makes one feel that one would like even to have <b>just</b> <b>beheld</b> him. We are in the midst, the very midst, of histories of that sort, miserable and terrible, here too; the Neuve Chapelle business, from a strange, in the sense of being a pretty false, glamour at first flung about which we are gradually recovering, seems to have taken a hideous toll of officers, and other distressing legends (legends of mistake and confusion) are somehow overgrowing it too. But painful particulars are not what I want to give you--of anything; you are up to your neck in your own, and I had much rather pick my steps to the clear places, so far as there be any such! I continue to try and keep my own existence one, so far as I may--a place clear of the last accablement, I mean: apparently what it comes to is that it's [...] "full up" [...] with the last but one.|$|E
60|$|Unto {{the twelve}} tribes {{scattered}} abroad, James, an apostle {{of the living}} God, And of the Lord Christ Jesus, salutation. My brethren, when you fall into temptation Of divers kinds, rejoice, as men that know From trial of your faith doth patience flow. But let your patience have its full effect, That you may be entire, without defect. If any of you lack wisdom, let him cry To God, and he will give it lib'rally, And not upbraid. But let him ask in faith, Not wavering, for he that wavereth, Unto a wave o' th' sea I will compare, Driv'n with the wind and tossed here and there. For let not such a man himself deceive, To think that he shall from the Lord receive. A double-minded man most surely lacketh Stability in all he undertaketh. Let ev'ry brother of a low degree Rejoice in that he is advanc'd, but he That's rich in being made low, for he shall pass Away, as doth the flow'r of the grass. For as the grass, soon as the sun doth rise, Is scorch'd by reason of the heat, and dies; Its flow'r fades, and it retains no more The beauteous comeliness it had before, So fades the rich man, maugre all his store. The man is blest that doth endure temptation For when he's try'd, the crown of God's salvation, The which the Lord hath promised to give To them that love him, that man shall receive. Let no man be possest with a persuasion, To say, when he falls under a temptation, That God's the cause; for with no evil can God be tempted, nor tempts he any man. But every man is tempted when he's drawn Away, and by his lusts prevail'd upon; Then when lust hath conceiv'd, it ushereth In sin, and sin when finished brings death. Err not, my brethren, whom I dearly love, Each good and perfect gift is from above, Down from th' original of lights descending, With whom's no change, nor shadow thereto tending, According to his own good pleasure, he Begat us with the word of truth, that we Should as the first fruits of his creatures be. Wherefore, beloved brethren, I entreat You to be swift to hear, and slow to speak, And slow to wrath, for wrath cannot incline The sons of men to righteousness divine. Wherefore avoiding ev'ry filthiness, And superfluity of naughtiness: Receive with meekness the engrafted word, Which can salvation to your souls afford. But be ye doers of the word each one, And not deceive yourselves to hear alone; For he that hears the word and doth it not, Is like unto a man that hath forgot What kind of man he was, tho' in a glass He <b>just</b> before <b>beheld</b> his nat'ral face. But whoso minds the law of liberty In its perfection, and continually Abides therein, forgets not what he's heard, But doth the work and therein hath reward. If any man among {{you seem to be}} Religious, he deceives himself if he Doth not his tongue as with a bit restrain; And all that man's religion is but vain. Religion, pure and undefil'd, which is Acceptable before the Lord, is this: To visit widows and the fatherless, In time of their affliction or distress; And so to regulate his conversation, As to be spotless in his generation.|$|R
