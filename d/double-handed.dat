25|$|Massú {{was born}} in a family of Palestinian and Hungarian-Jewish descent and {{introduced}} to tennis at age five by his grandfather, Ladislao Fried. From age 12, he was trained at the Valle Dorado tennis academy, near Villa Alemana, by Leonardo Zuleta, with whom he perfected his forehand and <b>double-handed</b> backhand. He later trained at the Nick Bollettieri academy, in Florida, United States, alongside Marcelo Ríos, and later at the High Performance Center in Barcelona, Spain.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Sampras {{family moved}} to Palos Verdes, California, and the warmer climate there allowed the seven-year-old Sampras to play tennis {{throughout}} more of the year. From early on, his great idol was Rod Laver, and {{at the age of}} 11, Sampras met and played tennis with the legend. The Sampras family joined the Jack Kramer Club, and it was here that Sampras's talent became apparent. He was spotted by Peter Fischer, a pediatrician and tennis enthusiast, who coached Sampras until 1989. Fischer was responsible for converting Sampras's <b>double-handed</b> backhand to single-hand with the goal of being better prepared to win Wimbledon.|$|E
25|$|Close combat troops, {{infantry}} and cavalry, {{made use of}} a spear, of varying length, usually {{referred to as a}} kontarion. Specialist infantry called menavlatoi used a heavy-shafted weapon called the menavlion the precise nature of which is uncertain; they are mentioned in the earlier Sylloge Tacticorum but may still have been extant. Swords were of two types: the spathion which was straight and double edged and differed only in details of the hilt from the typical ‘sword of war’ found in Western Europe, and the paramērion which {{appears to have been a}} form of single-edged, perhaps slightly curved, sabre. Most Byzantine soldiers would have worn swords as secondary weapons, usually suspended from a baldric rather than a waist belt. Heavy cavalry are described (in slightly earlier writings) as being doubly equipped with both the spathion and paramērion. Some missile-armed skirmish infantry used a relatively light axe (tzikourion) as a secondary weapon, whilst the Varangians were known as the “Axe-bearing Guard” because of their use of the <b>double-handed</b> Danish axe. The rhomphaia a long-bladed, cleaver-like, weapon was carried by guardsmen in close attendance on the emperor. Heavy cavalry made use of maces. Byzantine maces were given a variety of names including: mantzoukion, apelatikion and siderorabdion, suggesting that the weapons themselves were of varied construction.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he possessed}} a very {{consistent}} and powerful <b>double-handed</b> backhand, injury and surgeries {{on his wrist}} have rendered his backhand the main weakness in his game. Since his return in 2016, del Potro made tactical changes in his game {{in order to protect}} his wrist, like significantly reducing the pace of his two-hander and adopting a one-handed slice. Despite del Potro admitting that relying on slices is [...] "not my game," [...] the shot has been effective in moving his opponents out of position and slowing down rallies enough to allow him to set up powerful offensive shots with his forehand. Furthermore, to compensate for the newfound vulnerability in his backhand wing, del Potro has improved the power and accuracy of his other shots, most notably his serve.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left wrist at the US Open, and would have rested if his next event had not been the Davis Cup. At the Poland match, he won both his singles rubbers. For the doubles with Ross Hutchins, Murray began in the right-hand court, the side usually occupied by the less dominant partner, so as to afford more protection to his troublesome left wrist than when striking <b>double-handed</b> backhands from the left court., though allowed his partner to resume his usual role in the second set. [...] However, the pair succumbed to the world-class Polish duo, and Poland won 3–2;Great Britain were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group II {{for the first time}} since 1996. Murray had aggravated his wrist injury, so couldn't play for another six weeks.|$|E
500|$|The mildly complex {{reciprocal}} skill {{system was}} generally praised, {{with a few}} exceptions. IGN, though finding the manual's {{description of the system}} unclear, found the classes well balanced and well designed for all play styles. GameSpot found the system clear and sensible. PC Gamer, by contrast, found the system unbalanced, with combat privileged over other features. Computer Gaming World felt the system's privileging of combinations of single-handed combat weapons and shields over <b>double-handed</b> weapons unnecessarily exploitable, but appreciated the freedom offered by the broad skillset and action-dependent leveling. GameSpy gave strong commendation to the system, stating that [...] "The advancement system makes so much sense that it makes other games, even games set in the D world such as Baldur's Gate, look silly by comparison". Morrowinds combat system was poorly received by the gaming press. GameSpot characterized it as one of the game's major weak points and GameSpy devoted the majority of their review's minor complaints to it. The system was disparaged for its simplicity and for its tendency to bore.|$|E
2500|$|His {{ground game}} was complemented by his anticipation, speed {{and ability to}} end points at the net. Nalbandian's {{trademark}} shot is his <b>double-handed</b> backhand down-the-line, which was often regarded as the best <b>double-handed</b> backhand on the men's tour. He often used it {{to set up a}} point, by either hitting a clean winner or forcing a weak return from the opponent. Nalbandian is also known {{to be one of the}} game's best returners. He was consistently able to knock balls back deep on the baseline time and time again to effectively set up the point or rip return winners off second serves, but he also had the ability to block it back deep when returning a more effective serve. He also used a [...] "chip-and-charge" [...] technique against the opponents' serves to surprise them.|$|E
2500|$|Infantry at {{this time}} was most {{commonly}} armed with a longbow made of bamboo and a single- or <b>double-handed</b> broadsword probably similar to the khanda. Other foot soldiers could be armed with a large animal hide tower shield and a spear or javelins. Cavalry carried spears. Elephants were mounted, usually with Howdahs, which are an Indian invention [...] by archers or javelin throwers, with a mahout around the animal's neck. Chariots by this time were in definite decline, but remained in the army due to their prestige.|$|E
2500|$|... 2010's major storyline {{began in}} May at IPW Genesis, The main event at IPW's [...] "Genesis" [...] saw [...] "The One" [...] Vinny Dunn and The Samoan Silverback Alexander go head to head, but The Silverback {{failed to get}} the win. The end of the match was {{interrupted}} by Justin Lane, who stated that when Dunn put out an open challenge for the championship, Alexander wasn’t the only man to sign a contract for a title shot. He introduced that his 'monster' of a wrestler, Reuben De Jong, had responded to the challenge that would happen that night. The champion tried to retain, but the odds were against him and former heavyweight kickboxer and MMA fighter De Jong delivered a powerful <b>double-handed</b> chokeslam to take the win, and to be crowned new IPW champion. This being the most shocking moment of 2010 so far, would start {{one of the most}} heated feuds in IPW history.|$|E
2500|$|Hantuchová is {{right-handed}} but uses {{both hands}} when playing backhand shots. She {{can hit the}} ball hard with both her forehand and backhand but {{is best known as}} a player with natural timing and excellent technique. A [...] "superb ball-striker", she plays a flowing style, hitting deep, accurate groundstrokes. Her <b>double-handed</b> backhand is a particularly potent weapon. She is often described as an [...] "all-rounder". She has a strong, accurate serve and can play well when close to the net. She is famous for her long legs which are 43" [...] (110cm) long. Because she is so tall (5' 11"), she can cover a long distance in a short amount of time, which also helps in returning shots. Although her speed across court has reduced a little in recent years, she compensates with her stamina. Dubbed the [...] "Queen of 3-setters", as of 15 January 2014, Hantuchová had played 263 three-set matches, more than anyone else on the tour, winning 181 of them.|$|E
2500|$|The χ-blade, {{pronounced}} {{the same as}} [...] "Keyblade," [...] or as Xehanort mentioned once before [...] "Kai-blade" [...] (though you're more likely going to hear [...] "keyblade"), is an ancient weapon of unknown origin introduced in Birth by Sleep {{that is capable of}} directly unlocking Kingdom Hearts. It is a <b>double-handed</b> weapon that takes the shape of two [...] "Kingdom Key" [...] Keyblades that intersect in an [...] "X" [...] shape, with additional features that give it the shape of an actual sword. The weapon has the power to open the heart of all worlds, and it exists alongside Kingdom Hearts as its guardian. It led to [...] "Keyblades" [...] being crafted in its image by those seeking Kingdom Hearts' power, those who sought to extinguish the light, and those who sought to protect it. The end result was the Keyblade War, which ended in a world known as the Keyblade Graveyard; the aftermath led the χ-blade itself to shatter into seven pieces of light and thirteen pieces of darknesses. These seven lights, which are said to be the source of all light in the World, later became the hearts of the Princesses of Heart.|$|E
2500|$|Williams is {{primarily}} a baseline player, and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand {{is considered to be}} among the most powerful shots in the women's game, as is her <b>double-handed</b> backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a [...] "high risk" [...] style, is balanced in part by her serve, which most say is the greatest in women's tennis history. She consistently projects great pace and placement with her serves; in the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of [...] which is the third fastest all-time among female players (only Venus's 129mph and Sabine Lisicki's 131mph recorded speeds are faster). What makes her serve even more deadly is her ball placement and her ability to consistently place powerful shots with great accuracy. At the 2012 Championships at Wimbledon, she hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces, which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks, a rarity given that aces are more common in the men's game. Williams also possesses a very solid and powerful overhead. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game. She has stated that her favorite surface is clay because it gives her extra time to set up her shots.|$|E
2500|$|Noctis {{can perform}} four actions in battle: the {{standard}} attack; defending, which blocks and parries attacks; warping, which takes Noctis to a targeted area such as another enemy or an out-of-the-way warp point, and using items. There is a [...] "Wait Mode" [...] option available, where if all player input stops the battle pauses, and players {{are able to}} select new enemies to attack or actions to take within a time limit. An option available for both Noctis and Ignis in Wait Mode is Libra, an ability which displays an enemy's health, strengths and weaknesses. Noctis has access {{to a wide range}} of weapons, including single and <b>double-handed</b> swords, polearms, axes, shields, firearms and daggers. The weapons manifest from thin air as Noctis fights, and can be manually shifted by the player. The type of weapon equipped determines the attack speed and the amount of damage on normal attacks. In addition to normal attacks, there are attacks that deal more damage based on Noctis' position such as [...] "Side Strike" [...] or [...] "Blindside", in addition to the Warp Strike attack. Attacks from enemies can be parried, and depending on the quality of the parry Noctis can counterattack. If wielding a shield-type weapon, a successful block staggers an enemy, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Story-related weapons are the Royal Arms, which Noctis can summon for a special attack called [...] "Armiger", when the meter fills during combat: while more powerful than standard weapons, Royal Arms consume HP with each use. Noctis can also use two classes of firearmsGuns, which range from handguns like pistols to rifles; and Machinery, powerful weapons that have varying effects depending on the type used, from generating a powerful shockwave to dealing high melee damage.|$|E

60|$|Faster {{and more}} furious grew the fighting. Single Masai would spring upon the dead bodies of their comrades, and engage one or {{other of the}} axemen with their long spears; but, thanks chiefly to the mail shirts, the result was always the same. Presently {{there was a great}} swing of the axe, a {{crashing}} sound, and another dead Masai. That is, if the man was engaged with Sir Henry. If it was Umslopogaas that he fought with the result indeed would be the same, but it would be differently attained. It was but rarely that the Zulu used the crashing <b>double-handed</b> stroke; on the contrary, he did little more than tap continually at his adversary's head, pecking at it with the pole-axe end of the axe as a woodpecker {Endnote 7} pecks at rotten wood. Presently a peck would go home, and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole in his forehead or skull, exactly similar to that which a cheese-scoop makes in a cheese. He never used the broad blade of the axe except when hard pressed, or when striking at a shield. He told me afterwards that he did not consider it sportsmanlike.|$|E

6000|$|This is no trifling victory. Nay, a Kennet trout is far {{harder to}} catch and kill than the capricious salmon, which will often take a fly, however clumsy be the man who casts it. There is a profane theory that {{several members of the}} Hungerford Club never catch the trout they pay so much to have the {{privilege}} of trying to capture. A very sure eye and clever hand are needed to make the fly light dry and neat so close above the fish that he has not time to be alarmed by the gut. [...] "Gut-shy" [...] he is, and the less he sees of it the better. Moreover, a wonderful temper is required, for in the backward cast of the long line the hook will, ten to one, catch in a tree, or a flower, or a straw, or a bit of hay, and then it has to be disengaged by the angler crawling on hands and knees. Perhaps a northern angler will never quite master the delicacy of this sport, nor acquire the entomological knowledge which seems to be necessary, nor make up his mind between the partisans of the light one-handed rod and the <b>double-handed</b> rod.|$|E
60|$|As for Glumm, {{he frowned}} {{on the path}} most unamiably while he sauntered along with both hands thrust into the breast of his tunic, and the point of his sword rasping harshly against rocks and bushes. Glumm was {{peculiar}} in his weapons. He wore a <b>double-handed</b> and double-edged sword, which was so long that he was obliged to sling it across his back {{in order to keep}} it off the ground. The handle projected above his left shoulder, and the blade, lying diagonally across his person, extended beyond his right calf. The young man was remarkably expert in the use of this immense weapon, and was not only a terror to his foes, but, owing to the enormous sweep of its long blade, an object of some anxiety to his friends when they chanced to be fighting alongside of him. He wore a knife or dagger at his girdle on the right side, which was also of unusual size; in all probability it would have been deemed a pretty good sword by the Romans. There were only two men in the dale who could wield Glumm's weapons. These were Erling and his father, Haldor. The latter was as strong a man as Glumm, Erling was even stronger; though, being an amiable man he could not be easily persuaded to prove his strength upon his friends. Glumm wore his hair very short. It was curly, and lay close to his head.|$|E

Instantly a dense vapour arose, and the cave was filled with choking fumes that prevented us from seeing anything while the deadly acid (for I presume it was some tremendous preparation of that sort) did its work. From the spot where the body lay came a fierce fizzing and cracking sound, which ceased, however, before the fumes had cleared away. At last they were all gone, except a little cloud that still hung over the corpse. In a couple of minutes more this too had vanished, and, wonderful as it may seem, {{it is a fact that}} on the stone bench that had supported the mortal remains of the ancient Kallikrates for so many centuries there was now nothing to be seen but a few handfuls of smoking white powder.

6000|$|First {{they went}} into the {{gorgeous}} dining-room, fitted up, Lady Clavering couldn't for goodness gracious tell why, in the middle-aged style, [...] "unless," [...] said her good-natured ladyship, laughing, [...] "because me and Clavering are middle-aged people;"--and here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which Lady Clavering and Blanche had just partaken. When nobody was near, our little Sylphide, who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of Amina, the friend of the Ghouls in the Arabian Nights, was most active with her knife and fork, and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets: in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion. Pen and his uncle declined the refection, but they admired the dining-room with fitting compliments, and pronounced it [...] "very chaste," [...] that being the proper phrase. There were, indeed, high-backed Dutch chairs of the seventeenth century; there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth; there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the Low Countries, and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table; there were old family portraits from Wardour Street and tapestry from France, bits of armour, <b>double-handed</b> swords and battle-axes made of carton-pierre, looking-glasses, statuettes of saints, and Dresden china--nothing, in a word, could be chaster. Behind the dining-room was the library, fitted with busts and books all of a size, and wonderful easy-chairs, and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style. Here it was that, guarded by double doors, Sir Francis smoked cigars, and read Bell's Life in London, and went to sleep after dinner, when he was not smoking over the billiard-table at his clubs, or punting at the gambling-houses in Saint James's.|$|E
60|$|We {{were the}} only {{visitors}} who had entered the Torture Tower that morning--so at least said the old custodian--and as we had the place all to ourselves {{were able to make}} a minute and more satisfactory survey than would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking to us as the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet our wishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even now when many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and the joy that follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention it wore its grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed to have settled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to have become sentient {{in a way that would}} have satisfied the Pantheistic souls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we entered was seemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate darkness; even the hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the vast thickness of the walls, and only showed the masonry rough as when the builder's scaffolding had come down, but coated with dust and marked here and there with patches of dark stain which, if walls could speak, could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain. We were glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase, the custodian leaving the outer door open to light us somewhat on our way; for to our eyes the one long-wick'd, evil-smelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall gave an inadequate light. When we came up through the open trap in the corner of the chamber overhead, Amelia held on to me so tightly that I could actually feel her heart beat. I must say for my own part that I was not surprised at her fear, for this room was even more gruesome than that below. Here there was certainly more light, but only just sufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place. The builders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should gain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect. There, as we had noticed from below, were ranges of windows, albeit of mediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few narrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence. A few of these only lit the chamber, and these so high up in the wall that from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the walls. In racks, and leaning in disorder against the walls, were a number of headsmen's swords, great <b>double-handed</b> weapons with broad blade and keen edge. Hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of the victims had lain, with here and there deep notches where the steel had bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood. Round the chamber, placed in all sorts of irregular ways, were many implements of torture which made one's heart ache to see--chairs full of spikes which gave instant and excruciating pain; chairs and couches with dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less, but which, though slower, were equally efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars, all made for compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could be slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen's hooks with long handle and knife that cut at resistance--this a speciality of the old Nurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man's injury to man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but fortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on a torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to faint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress by the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her, and Mr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a kind-hearted laugh.|$|E
