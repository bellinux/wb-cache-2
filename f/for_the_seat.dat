5|$|Many Democrats {{were anxious}} to return Senator J. C. S. Blackburn to his seat in Congress, but some were instead {{supporting}} ex-Governor John Y. Brown. Democratic state senator Albert Berry was also making overtures about being considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Republican legislators nominated W.

On ballot after ballot, no candidate received a majority, though Blackburn received 65 votes once, leaving him just two votes shy of election. Treasury Secretary John G.
