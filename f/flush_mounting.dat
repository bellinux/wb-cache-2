2500|$|An early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} was invented by Harvey Hubbell and patented in 1904. Hubbell's first design was a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs), but with a separable plug with pins (...) or blades (US patent 774251). The 1906 Hubbell catalog shows the blade plug with a <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> socket for use in wall or floor.

60|$|With a <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> to his cheeks, and {{his brows}} drawn {{together}} in perplexity, Garnache surveyed him. He was that same traveller who had lately clamoured {{to know when}} he might sup, a man of rather more than middle height, lithe and active of frame, yet with a breadth of shoulder and depth of chest that argued strength and endurance as well. He had fair, wavy hair, which he wore rather longer than was the mode, brown eyes, and a face which, without being handsome, was yet more than ordinarily engaging {{by virtue of its}} strength and frank ingenuousness. His dress was his worst feature. It was flamboyant and showy; cheap, and tawdrily pretentious. Yet he bore himself with the easy dignity of a man who counts more inferiors than superiors.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{stripped}} off his cassock and put away his hat, and, a ludicrous figure in ill-fitting black knee-breeches and a not very clean shirt, a red handkerchief round his neck, {{he proceeded to}} give great extravagant blows at the tree. He was like a caricature. In the doorway Maria was encouraging him rather jeeringly, whilst she winked at me. Marco was stifling his hysterical amusement in his mother's apron, and prancing with glee. Paolo and Giovanni stood by the fallen tree, very grave and unmoved, inscrutable, abstract. Then the youth came away to the doorway, with a <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> {{on his face and}} a grimace distorting its youngness. Only Paolo, unmoved and detached, stood by the tree with unchanging, abstract face, very strange, his eyes fixed in the ageless stare which is so characteristic.|$|E

50|$|Many {{accessories}} for {{electrical installations}} (e.g., wall sockets, switches) sold in the UK are designed {{to fit into the}} mounting boxes defined in BS 4662:2006 - Boxes for <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> of electrical accessories - Requirements, test methods and dimensions, with an 86 mm×86 mm square face plate that is fixed {{to the rest of the}} enclosure by two M3.5 screws (typ. 25 mm or 40 mm long) located on a horizontal centre line, 60.3 mm apart. Double face plates for BS 4662 boxes measure 147 mm×86 mm and have the two screws 120.6 mm apart.|$|E
50|$|The SAFER barrier {{consists}} of structural steel tubes welded {{together in a}} <b>flush</b> <b>mounting,</b> strapped in place to the existing concrete retaining wall. Behind these tubes are bundles of closed-cell polystyrene foam, placed between the barrier and wall. The theory behind the design is that the barrier absorbs {{a portion of the}} kinetic energy released when a race car makes contact with the wall. This energy is dissipated along a longer portion of the wall. The impact energy to the car and driver are reduced, and the car is likewise not propelled back into traffic on the racing surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums have hard covers with thick, {{unbending}} pages. They {{consist of}} photographic prints that were dry-mounted on cardboard. The covers are mostly made of leather, leatherette or glass. The photos lie completely flat and extend {{across the whole}} page. <b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are usually designed in magazine-style. They are most often used for special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries {{due to the fact}} that they are produced at a higher quality and are more expensive to produce than coffee table books.|$|R

50|$|Digital photo {{books have}} {{digitally}} printed pages {{as opposed to}} albums that consist of traditional photos. Both <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums as well as coffee table books are printed digitally. The photos of <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are printed on photographic paper, which {{is comparable to the}} quality of traditionally developed photos. Coffee table books, on the other hand, are printed with inkjet on ordinary paper and are therefore of a lower quality. Digital printing gives the album designer a vast number of design possibilities, for example magazine-style or montage albums are only possible with digital printing.|$|R

Experimental data in the mach-number range 0. 58 - 2. 0 are presented for distortion of the measured wall-pressure fluctuation spectra of the turbulent boundary layer by recessed and protruding transducers. The results of flight experiments are compared with data of wind tunnel experiments.

30|$|Appearance {{should not}} to be {{overlooked}} {{when it comes to}} installing cameras. If the cameras will be installed in an outdoor environment, large outdoor enclosures may invoke a sense of intimidation (see Figure 4 (a)). It is recommended to take into consideration the environment the cameras will be installed to decide whether discreetness or visibility are higher concerns. As opposed to surface-mounting (installing a camera directly on a ceiling surface), flush-mounting (cutting a hole and installing a camera in the ceiling with the optics exposed) will provide a more discreet and streamlined appearance, but will require permanent alteration to the installation locations. If a network is temporary, readers are recommended to consider the life expectancy of the network before opting for <b>flush</b> <b>mounting.</b>|$|E
