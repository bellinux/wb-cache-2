His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalogue, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right symbols that are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalogue listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> as a result the symbol is still listed in the catalogue of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.|$|E
