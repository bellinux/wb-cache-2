5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena galopus grow in groups to {{scattered}} on humus under hardwoods or conifers. In the United States, {{it is very}} abundant along the Pacific Coast <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> California, and also in Tennessee and North Carolina; its northern distribution extends to Canada (Nova Scotia). In Europe, it has been collected from Britain, Germany, Ireland, and Norway.|$|E
5|$|A March 1779 letter <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> Scott, {{still on}} {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was {{in command of the}} militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} allowed {{people to}} quickly travel long distances {{and a way}} to mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles. Most of legislative Route6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY5 from Silver Creek to Albany, and modern US20 again from Albany to Massachusetts.|$|E

The entire line is double-tracked. MARC operates commuter services, known as the Brunswick Line, <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> Brunswick and points west.

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena adscendens are found {{scattered}} to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs, bark, and woody debris of hardwoods {{during the spring}} and autumn; it fruits less frequently on the wood of conifers. Fruitings are most common after periods of wet weather. They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M.discopus and M.nucicola. In the United States, it is known <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> California. It {{is also found in}} Europe, and has been collected in Amasya Province, Turkey. The variety carpophila, originally described from Denmark, was reported from Japan in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain {{for the rest of}} his life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>to</b> northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, the Lions Gate Bridge was completed, which {{significantly}} reduced demand for ferry service. However, {{there was an}} increase in demand with the onset of World War II because of the shipbuilding boom in North Vancouver.
