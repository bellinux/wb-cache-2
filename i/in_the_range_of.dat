5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E

40|$|A new {{analytical}} method for the separation and determination of R-(-) - and S-(+) - baclofen enantiomers in human plasma by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) with UV detection was developed.
