25|$|In {{the present}} {{indicative}} of both {{formal and informal}} Quebec French, (s')asseoir (to sit/seat) only uses the vowel /wa/ in stressed roots and /e/ in unstressed roots: je m'assois, tu t'assois, il s'assoit, ils s'assoient but nous nous asseyons, vous vous asseyez. In Metropolitan French, stressed /wa/ and /je/ are in <b>free</b> <b>variation</b> as are unstressed /wa/ and /e/. Note that in informal Quebec French, (s')asseoir is often said as (s')assire.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{solutions}} of the Euclidean-signature Einstein equations (gravitational instantons) whose line-element takes the Kerr-bolt form, characterized by three real parameters: a size, a NUT charge, and a spin rate. The exclusion of singularities eliminates most combinations of these parameters, leaving only separated solution-manifolds between which continuous transitions are impossible (The angular velocity {{divided by the}} temperature is forced to be a rational multiple of 2 π). This "quantization" prevents the <b>free</b> <b>variations</b> presupposed by an equation like T dS=dM + Ω dJ, and thereby renders the first law true, false, meaningless, or tautological, depending on how one approaches it.

40|$|This paper mainly {{describes}} {{the uses of}} the frequently used sentence final particles wo 3 and bo 3 in the 1990 s in Hong Kong Cantonese by examining speech data. In the past twenty years, most experts treated wo 3 and bo 3 as variant forms, the former being the result of sound change from the latter (Kwok 1984, Luke 1990, Li 1995, Fang 2003). In order to verify whether wo 3 and bo 3 are different particles or <b>free</b> <b>variations</b> of the same particle, the synchronic picture of the two particles will be considered by comparing their uses and functions in the 1990 s with the language examples from the Hong Kong University Cantonese Corpus and local movies...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the geometrical shape, wetting length, and contact angle of a microdroplet on a fiber by using the method <b>free</b> energy <b>variation.</b> The governing equation and relevant boundary conditions of the microdroplet were re-derived based on the <b>free</b> energy <b>variation</b> of the droplet/ fiber system. The geometrical shape of the droplet was determined as the combination of Legendre’s elliptical functions of the first and second kinds, corresponding to the previous results in literature [6]. For contact angle h 3 ̆e 15 degree, a novel efficient semi-analytic approach was proposed to extract the contact angle from experimental data. The given approach can be used as theoretical basis of determining surface tension of fluids based on a sessile drop on a fiber...|$|R
5000|$|In December 1954, Picasso {{began to}} paint a series of <b>free</b> <b>variations</b> on Delacroix's Les Femmes d'Alger.
