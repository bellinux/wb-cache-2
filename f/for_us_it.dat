5|$|Initially, {{the filming}} of the concert was planned for the shows in Colombia, but due to {{conflicts}} with the directors' schedule, those shows were not filmed. Instead, Madonna announced on her Facebook page that the November 19 and 20 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, will be filmed for the upcoming tour DVD and Blu-ray release. After accepting the award for Top Touring Artist at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards, Madonna confirmed that she had just finished editing the DVD of the concert, with Billboard predicting the video release to be in September 2013. It was officially announced by Madonna's website that the video album for the tour will be released on August 26, 2013, by Live Nation and Interscope Records; the date was later changed to September 6 and 9 for non-US countries and September 10 <b>for</b> <b>US.</b> <b>It</b> documented the November 19 and 20 shows at the American Airlines Arena, but also will include footage from other concert dates. The documentary was directed by Danny B. Tull and Stephane Sennour—who also directed the YouTube concert special MDNA: Live à l'Olympia and the behind-the-scenes documentary Inside the DNA of MDNA—and was produced by Madonna. MDNA World Tour is Madonna's tenth live video album and was released on both DVD and Blu-ray. Madonna had spent six months editing the footage from the films and together with Tull and Sennour she constructed each of the performances in the video as a mini-movie.|$|E

We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E

Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. <b>For</b> <b>us,</b> <b>it</b> was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians."

500|$|With {{his left}} hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States {{successfully}} {{at the start of}} 1930, propped up by his recent European success. That year Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet On the Dnieper, Op. 51, a work commissioned by Serge Lifar, who had been appointed maitre de ballet at the Paris Opéra. In 1931 and 1932, he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos. The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song, Op. 57, which Prokofiev's friend Myaskovsky – thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union – told him [...] "isn't quite <b>for</b> <b>us...</b> <b>it</b> lacks that which we mean by monumentalism – a familiar simplicity and broad contours, of which you are extremely capable, but temporarily are carefully avoiding." ...|$|E

[...] De Homem-Christo noted, [...] "It is true that it is not his usual register, it is the way Julian reacted to the track so <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>it</b> is even more exciting." [...] "Lose Yourself to Dance" [...] features Pharrell Williams and {{was the result of a}} desire to create dance music with live drummers. To that end, Robinson appears as session player.

[...] Barron aimed to get 50,000 votes in the governor's race, enough to gain ballot access for the party, but ended up with 24,560 votes out of over 3,000,000 cast. More than 75% of the votes cast for Barron originated in New York City.|$|R

Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts out our final season in a real special way."

The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> <b>It</b> was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could.

Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It was something you hadn’t seen, or wanted to see or wondered about, so <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>it</b> was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle." [...] Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that [...] "Each year we’ve tried to reinvent the series in some way ...

In 2005, after Aniston's divorce from Brad Pitt, she and her mother reportedly reconciled.

500|$|In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas {{was married}} to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually {{shortened}} to [...] "Kasturba", and affectionately to [...] "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the {{custom of the region}} at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>it</b> meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{agreement between}} Pakistan and the United States {{was never an}} issue of money alone. [...] "It {{was a matter of}} honor for the army," [...] said Laiq ur-Rehman, a Pakistani defence correspondent for ARY News, a cable channel. [...] "The only word they were looking for was 'sorry.' It was a matter of pride, a matter of honor, a matter of ego." [...] "If it had been about the money, it would have been done months ago," [...] said an US enior administration official knowledgeable about the negotiations. [...] "Just like <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>it</b> was not just about the supply routes." [...] According to the BBC the reason for the long US refusal to apologise for the Salala incident was deep anger among Americans about the death of US soldiers in Afghanistan from attacks by militant groups with alleged connections to Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency. Another reason for the United States refusal to apologise was the determination by American military investigators that Pakistan was equally culpable in the Salala incident because Pakistani soldiers, stationed on a ridge overlooking the border, had fired first on US troops on the Afghan side of the border. Pakistan has disputed that conclusion, saying its forces did not fire first.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> <b>It</b> doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard <b>for</b> <b>us...</b> <b>It</b> was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic.
