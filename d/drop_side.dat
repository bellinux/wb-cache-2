Cab and control gear from the original locomotive being used to produce the present version in 1926. Something of an oddity, consisting of a steeple cab between two three plank <b>drop</b> <b>side</b> freight compartments. The railway's only electric locomotive, currently in store and privately owned.|$|E

50|$|The bridge has a {{footpath}} on {{both sides}} of the bridge. The path on the west side is under a metre wide, much too narrow to cycle on. The path on the east side is listed as a shared cycle path, but it is also only 1.7 m wide bound between a low barrier with a steel hand rail on the road side and a 2m fence on the <b>drop</b> <b>side.</b> These barriers make the effective path about 1 m wide for two way cycle and pedestrian traffic. Austroads minimum standard for a shared path is 2.5 m, plus 0.4 to 1 m clearance from barriers.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{corticosteroid}} eye <b>drops,</b> <b>side</b> effects include hypersensitivity and, especially after long-term use, secondary eye infections, cataract (clouding {{of the eye}} lens) and increased intraocular pressure, leading to glaucoma. Consequently, the drug should not be applied longer than 24 days without further medical evaluation.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the house is a modern frame hip roofed garage with <b>drop</b> <b>siding.</b> Scattered behind the house to the north and east are four chicken coops, one story shed-roofed frame buildings.

5000|$|Jointed {{horizontal}} siding (also called [...] "drop" [...] siding or novelty siding) may be shiplapped or {{tongue and}} grooved (though less common). <b>Drop</b> <b>siding</b> {{comes in a}} wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log siding (milled with curve).|$|R
50|$|Some older cribs {{contained}} a drop gate (or <b>drop</b> <b>side),</b> a side which lowers {{to ease the}} process of putting the child into the bed, but can be raised again to restore {{the integrity of the}} enclosure. However, assembly problems and malfunctioning hardware on drop gates can cause the formation of gaps, which have been attributed to infant deaths and other major injuries. In June 2011, the United States implemented new safety standards requiring all infant beds manufactured and sold in the country to have fixed sides. In June 2016, Canada implemented a similar ban on the sale, importation, or distribution of any infant bed containing drop sides effective December 29, 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Colombia {{maintains}} {{a fleet of}} REO M35 [...] "Meteoro" [...] armored trucks.

Early vehicles were not fabricated to any particular standard and typically hosted three weapon stations that could be fitted with a 7.62 mm (.308-cal) or [...]50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun. The weapon stations {{may or may not}} have had a gun shield on any particular vehicle. More recent examples follow a pattern with the cab and fuel tanks armored and the <b>drop</b> <b>side</b> cargo bed converted to an armored box, atop which is a [...] "gun tower," [...] a set of four heavily armored weapon stations, one facing each direction[...]50-caliber machine guns are mounted front and back, with 7.62 mm machine guns mounted to the sides.

5000|$|This {{generation}} has been {{produced in the}} Philippines since 1987 as the [...] "Mitsubishi L300 Versa Van" [...] (discontinued in April 2012) {{as well as the}} Cab/Chassis variant where local coach builders assemble rear bodies for passenger and cargo hauling purposes. Variations such as the FB (family business), PET (personal and equipment transport), WT (water tight aluminum van) and DS (<b>drop</b> <b>side)</b> have been made to cater to those needs. In 2010, an extended rear body variant for the FB variant called the Exceed was added. In 2014, local truck body manufacturer Centro Manufacturing launched a minibus version of the L300 called the XV Mikrobus. It is built on the FB Exceed platform and is meant {{to be used as a}} public utility vehicle, a school bus, or an ambulance.

5000|$|The Terrace is one {{of three}} natural {{terraces}} formed within the grounds by land subsidences of past days - the rocks and boulders of the sub-soil having been left bare. Lying a little to the south-west of the castle, it has been turfed- over and faced with stone on the <b>drop</b> <b>side</b> to prevent deer or cattle getting up or rabbits getting in. The artificial portion of this lay-out is about a mile long and is bordered on the garden side by trees and shrubs. From this terrace the views over to the mountains beyond are unrivalled. Below, through the foreground of this landscape, wanders the River Lowther - sometimes over shallows and rapids, with deep pools intervening and crossed at intervals by stone hump-backed bridges. Between it and Hawes Water lie rolling hills whilst looking slightly left there is an uninterrupted view of miles over the park to the fells. Lord Lonsdale and his brother Lancelot have built a large rustic summer-house in the centre of the terrace which contains an old water clock taken from one of the former Lowther houses and having on it the inscription “Night cometh” ...|$|E
50|$|June Anne Devaney {{had been}} {{admitted}} to the Queen's Park Hospital in Blackburn, Lancashire on 5 May 1948, to recover from a mild bout of pneumonia. She was placed in ward CH3 of the premises. Shortly after midnight on 15 May, nurse Gwendolyn Humphreys (who was in the ward's kitchen) heard a child's cry coming from the ward. She checked the ward, soothed the child and returned him to his cot, noting {{as she did so}} the child in the adjacent cot——June Anne Devaney —was sound asleep. She then returned to her duties. At 1:20 am, she felt a draught and noticed an open door {{at the end of the}} ward. She closed it, and saw both that June Anne's cot was empty, and adult footprints—made by stockinged feet—were visible upon the highly waxed floor. Ominously, the <b>drop</b> <b>side</b> of the cot was still in place, meaning the child had to have been lifted from her cot.Nurse Humphreys made a quick search of the ward, desperately attempting to find June Anne. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, she contacted the local police. They arrived at 1:55 am and fully searched the hospital and its grounds, finding the child's body at 3:17 am. Her body lay face down in the grass alongside an 8 ft tall sandstone boundary wall some 300 ft from the ward, and immediately apparent were extensive bloodstains and tearing to her nightdress, numerous skull fractures, and blood exuding from her nostrils. The area where her body was discovered was promptly cordoned off, and at 4:20 a.m., the Chief Constable of Blackburn Police contacted Scotland Yard, seeking the assistance of an experienced investigator.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to assess loading conditions on a {{spent fuel storage}} cask for end <b>drops,</b> <b>side</b> <b>drops</b> and tipover events. The tests {{were performed}} with a 1 / 3 -scale model billet and a 1 / 3 -scale model concrete pad, and included a variety of substrate materials. A NUREG/CR report was prepared for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and provides a summary and an evaluation of all the billet testing conducted. This paper provides {{a description of the}} testing and analysis method, and a summary of the results. A generic or representative cask was modeled with the benchmarked finite element analysis approach and evaluated for ISFSI end and <b>side</b> <b>drops</b> and tipover events. The analytical method can be applied to similar casks to estimate deceleration loads on storage casks resulting from low-velocity drop or tipover impacts onto concrete storage pads...|$|R
50|$|Returning to Canada, Brutinel {{directed}} {{the design of}} the armoured bodies that would be mounted on the truck chassis. The end result was an open topped armoured box with an angled front plate and <b>drop</b> <b>sides.</b> The machine guns were pedestal mounted, capable of firing over the sides of the vehicle, and also able to be dismounted for ground use. The Armoured Autocar weighed 3 tons, had a crew of 8 and had a maximum speed of 40 kph mph on roads; its offroad capabilities were limited.|$|R
500|$|The initial wave of {{construction}} between 1891–97 was representative of typical army posts of the period.
