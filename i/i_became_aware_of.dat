500|$|In 1900 Bax {{moved on}} to the Royal Academy of Music, where he {{remained}} until 1905, studying composition with Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner, whose music was Bax's principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, [...] "For a dozen years of my youth I wallowed in Wagner's music to the almost total exclusion – until <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Richard Strauss – of any other". Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was at the}} International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in {{the year}} 1900 that <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{importance}} of logical reform for the philosophy of mathematics. ... I {{was impressed by the}} fact that, in every discussion, [...] showed more precision and more logical rigour than was shown by anybody else. ... It was [...] that gave the impetus to my own views on the principles of mathematics.|$|E

[...] Seifert said: “When I joined Miss Earth <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the things I can do as a Filipino and as a citizen of the world. I would like to share this awareness with more people, whether on a personal level or through the media. I want to make a difference in every little way I can.” She nailed the competition with her answer.|$|E

2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people {{to the scene of the}} fire.|$|E

5000|$|Norsworthy {{grew up in}} a Christian home, and {{although}} he prayed a prayer of commitment as a five-year-old, he recommitted his life at age 13 whilst on a camp. He made a public declaration of his faith in Jesus at age 18 when he was baptised. He states that he [...] "discovered God's amazing grace for the first time only a handful of years ago. Throughout my life, and even today, <b>I</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> areas of my life that I have not yet fully surrendered to Jesus." ...|$|R
60|$|In like manner <b>I</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{relation}} of before and after in time. Suppose I hear a chime of bells: when the last bell of the chime sounds, I can retain the whole chime before my mind, and I can perceive that the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also in memory I perceive that what I am remembering came before the present time. From either of these sources I can abstract the universal relation of before and after, just as I abstracted the universal relation 'being to the left of'. Thus time-relations, like space-relations, are among those with which we are acquainted.|$|R

40|$|A {{personal}} introduction My {{academic career}} started in agriculture, then I obtained my doctorate {{in the faculty}} of medicine, and only after this did <b>I</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> ecology as a science applied to fisheries. I had learned to gather data on complex problems in agriculture and medicine, analyse the data and form conclusions. When I started to study the biology of the sea in the late 1950 s, {{it was apparent that}} biological studies were dominated by fisheries science. This science had a different approach to those that I had learned earlier – fisheries science was dominated by a theory on population dynamics in which there was little agreement between the data and the theory.

5000|$|My own {{experience}} {{at the time of}} the descent of revelation—which comes to me in the form <b>of</b> Wahie-Walayat—is that <b>I</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> an external and very powerful hold over myself. At times this influence is so strong and its light so takes hold of me, and so forcefully do I find myself drawn towards it, that I am powerless to resist. Under this influence, I hear clear and manifest revelation. Sometimes I even see the angels and perceive the power and awe of the truth. Very often the revelation comprehends matters of the unseen. The external hold is so powerful that it gives evidence of the existence of God. To deny this would be the carnage of a self evident truth. (p. 41) ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> my aunt's head {{sticking}} out obliquely {{from behind the}} coffee-machine and regarding me with wide blue curiosity. I met her gaze for a moment, flinched, coloured, and laughed.|$|E

60|$|Outside, {{the fresh}} morning wind came like a sudden sweet tonic to my jaded nerves. I {{paused for a}} moment to face bareheaded the rush of it from the sea.

60|$|I don't {{know that}} I am liable to fits of {{delirium}} {{but by a}} sudden and alarming aberration while waiting for her answer <b>I</b> <b>became</b> mentally <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> three trained dogs dancing on their hind legs. I don't know why. Perhaps because of the pervading solemnity. There's nothing more solemn on earth than a dance of trained dogs.|$|R
60|$|Those {{questions}} were still present to my thoughts; {{my eyes were}} still fixed on the mysterious writing--when <b>I</b> <b>became</b> instinctively <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the strange silence in the room.

60|$|If, {{while the}} {{sovereign}} {{lies on the}} hand, the latter being kept quite steady, the fore-arm is gradually and slowly raised; the tactile sensations, with all their accompaniments, remain exactly as they were. But, at the same time, something new is introduced; namely, the sense of effort. If I try to discover where this sense of effort seems to be, I find myself somewhat perplexed at first; but, if I hold the fore-arm in position long enough, <b>I</b> <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> an obscure sense of fatigue, which is apparently seated either in {{the muscles of the}} arm, or in the integument directly over them. The fatigue seems {{to be related to the}} sense of effort, in much the same way as the pain which supervenes upon the original sense of contact, when a pin is slowly pressed against the skin, is related to touch.|$|R
