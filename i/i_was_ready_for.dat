Jones {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said [...] "It was hard because I'd just had my son and it was make it— or join the army. I had a family to support and at that time, it was either this is it... or I go into the services. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> that life." [...] Jones began his professional career with Joe Public in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. He soon moved to W Connection where he played for two years.|$|E

In most cases, it's inspiring but in that {{particular}} song I was pissed off with it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a break but it didn't seem fair on the people I worked with at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philosophical Investigations was {{published}} in two parts in 1953. Most of Part <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called [...] "language gone on holiday." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Poor music!' said Laura, smiling. 'But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a lecture; <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{feeling more}} like a {{butterfly}} than I like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>I</b> imagine <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> them," [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "Although I {{sincerely}} hope I {{will not}} have occasion to draw the pistol." ...|$|R
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the scrapheap.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> {{the enemy}} now. Let the {{approaching}} big day come along--it would find us on deck.|$|E
60|$|I had not {{expected}} an examination, but fortunately <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> one. My answers seemed to please him, for his stern features relaxed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{left the}} senator {{and his family}} well," [...] was the answer. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the trip--that is--part of the trip," [...] Dave added, hastily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} saying in Forli {{that you would}} fight me when the opportunity presented itself. It has! And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready,</b> <b>for</b> <b>I</b> have {{to thank you for}} my banishment from Castello.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear rash boy!" [...] said she. [...] "But is he safe? No, {{do not say}} where. Thanks, {{thanks to}} heaven. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> anything!" [...] and so indeed her face proved.|$|R
60|$|I made {{no answer}} to that, but I tried to show him by my bearing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the worst which could befall me.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a mighty}} {{engineering}} job with only wild Arabs and their wilder mounts {{to do the}} work of an electric crane--but finally it was completed, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> departure.|$|E
60|$|I laughed. I {{was thirty}} years old, {{and the love}} of {{adventure}} was always in my blood. For the first time for many days the weariness seemed to have passed away. My heart was beating. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> any enterprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{they told}} me you had ordered your supper at six, so I told them I would take mine at the same time; and, indeed, I {{can tell you that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nelly, <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> a welting, <b>I</b> ha' {{deserved}} it if ever a chap did, and I'll take it. Here's the stick, and he's a good un and will sting rare, I warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! your daughter, {{but still}} a woman. Do I murmur? Do I complain? Have I urged you to {{compromise}} your honour? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the sacrifice. My conduct is yours, but my feelings are my own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|All through Chamberlain {{spoke of}} {{reducing}} to an absolute minimum [...] {{his idea of}} necessary conditions, and this conversation so far [...] left untouched the question of men, he apparently assuming [...] (wrongly) that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> another three or four years’ [...] engagement.|$|E
6000|$|He {{fired up}} at that, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> him, and Jim was warming his opinion, too, and next minute we'd 'a' broke loose on another argument, if Tom hadn't dropped {{the glass and}} begun to clap his hands like a maniac and sing out: ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was what}} you would call talking. He was going on, besides, with more of it, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> as much taffy as he had in stock, for I felt good. But Uma had been taken up with {{something}} half through the marriage, and cut straight in.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{are just}} at present; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> any change of plans, and want you to {{understand}} fully how little it would take to induce me to send a bullet into your worthless head." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mar. Come, now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> you; {{as little}} devotion, {{and as much}} good huswifery as you please. Take example by me: I assure you, nobody debauches me to church, except it be in your company. [...] [Exeunt.|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{have fought}} many veterans, undefeated guys and now contenders. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the next level, any {{lightweight}} out there, preferably {{in the top}} 10, because <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very close to realizing my dream to become world champion.” ...|$|R
6000|$|At nine, {{the next}} morning, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> my visitor. At half past nine, I heard steps outside my door. [...] "Come in, Gooseberry!" [...] I called out. [...] "Thank you, sir," [...] {{answered}} a grave and melancholy voice. The door opened. I started to my feet, and confronted--Sergeant Cuff.|$|E
60|$|After that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> {{anything}} that might happen. The lift had descended and the porter bade us enter. We stopped at the third floor. In the open doorway {{of one of the}} flats Mr. Parker was standing, solid and imposing. He beckoned us, with a broad smile, to follow him.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the journey, spurred and booted, with my rapier at my side, and in the pocket of my haut-de­chausses a purse {{containing}} some fifty pistoles--best part of which I had won from Vilmorin at lansquenet some nights before, and which moderate sum represented all the moneys that I possessed.|$|E
60|$|If {{you want}} the Gegenseitigengeldbeitragendenverhaltnismassigkeiten rearranged and readjusted <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> that. <b>I</b> will let you off at twenty-eight per cent.--twenty-seven--even twenty-five if you insist, for there is nothing illiberal about me when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> out on a {{diplomatic}} debauch.|$|R
2500|$|Now {{completely}} insane, Norma mistakes the {{swarms of}} police and reporters who arrive for studio personnel.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] Brooks said, [...] "if {{it is to}} be {{war between}} us and the other {{charitable}} institutions you name, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> it, but <b>I</b> cannot talk to you now. As you see, I have an evening's work before me." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> them. With hooks and sinkers {{on our own}} lines aft, we tossed out, grappled, captured, and broke off nine of their lines. But the next time, so slow is the {{movement}} of so large a ship, the mutineers hauled all their lines safely inboard ere they towed aft {{within striking distance of}} my grapnels.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no time}} to lose, however; and {{the course}} I {{actually}} decided to take will be soonest told by relating things as they occurred. I heard the door open, and was ready for action. Whether the incendiaries intended to retreat by the cliff, or to open the gate, which was barred within, I could not tell; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> either alternative.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked with}} my rifle cocked {{and pointed at}} the man {{directly}} in front of me, prodding him with the muzzle now and then that he might know <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> action, and Sergeant Corney kept the whole party moving at a good smart pace, for we had no assurance that there were not sober men enough in the enemy's camp to play the mischief with our bold plan.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps he may, then, {{insist upon}} our {{marriage}} at once!' Stephen answered, seeing {{a ray of}} hope in the very focus of her remorse. 'I hope he may, {{even if we had}} still to part till <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> you, as we intended.' ...|$|R
60|$|Wild. Answer nothing, for it will but inflame the quarrel betwixt us: I {{must come}} to myself by little and little; and when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> satisfaction, <b>I</b> will take it: But at present {{it is not for}} my honour to be friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "None of {{you must}} know. No one shall enter my 'ghost-room' till <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> my tests. In fact, I think I shall send you all {{out for a}} drive this {{afternoon}} so {{that you may not}} even hear the tap of a hammer." ...|$|R
