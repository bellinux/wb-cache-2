5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at <b>every</b> <b>window</b> being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost <b>every</b> <b>window,</b> front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

5|$|<b>Every</b> <b>window</b> in {{the church}} {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E
5|$|Monastic {{foundations}} {{were once}} abundant in Dorset, but all {{ceased to exist}} at the Dissolution. The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until {{the turn of the}} 18th century. Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, {{it is one of the}} last examples of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced <b>every</b> <b>window</b> by 1984.|$|E

25|$|Although {{attempts}} by three tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} largest piece of the wreck were unsuccessful, the next spring tide carried it up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite the port of Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he manoeuvred a box filled with gelignite underneath the wreck and detonated it after clearing the area. The resulting explosion was so violent that reports claim <b>every</b> <b>window</b> in the nearby harbour of Padstow was blown in and the smoke could be seen three miles (5 km) away.|$|E

25|$|At one point, the {{gas tank}} exploded, which put out the store’s gaslights. The men worked on by candlelight and the glow from the {{approaching}} flames. The employees got enough steam up to operate the store’s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store's fire hoses to wet down the roof and the wall {{on the side of}} the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city's waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless.

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. <b>Every</b> <b>window</b> element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to {{provide a sense of}} depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.|$|E
25|$|On 6 February the Marines {{attacked}} the Provincial Headquarters {{which served as}} the command post of the PAVN 4th Regiment. While the Marines seized the surrounding wall easily the area between {{the wall and the}} building was covered by fire from <b>every</b> <b>window</b> and spider-holes in the grounds. An Ontos was brought forward to blast an entry into the building, but was disabled by a B-40 rocket and a Mule was brought forward to blow a hole in the building and the Marines advanced under cover of tear gas. Entering the building the Marines fought room by room, clearing the building, but many of the PAVN slipped away. With the building secured the Marines then cleared out the spider-holes methodically shooting their occupants. The Marines raised an American flag to celebrate their victory, but shortly thereafter were ordered to lower it, for in accordance with South Vietnamese law, no US flag was permitted to be flown without an accompanying South Vietnamese flag.|$|E
