5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a <b>diving</b> <b>board,</b> jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of large-scale, campus-wide events occur {{annually}} at UBC which are organized by university institutions, the AMS, and student constituencies of various faculties and departments. Additionally, a number of unofficial traditions exist at UBC: jumping from the Aquatic Centre's 10-metre <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> {{late at night and}} repainting the Engineering cairn so as to advertise other clubs.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{parabola}} is symmetrical, {{the travel}} {{away from the}} board as the diver passes it is twice {{the amount of the}} forward travel {{at the peak of the}} flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> is essential on safety grounds.|$|E
25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism. He likens it to a small boy jumping {{up and down on the}} <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> of an empty pool: what starts out in innocence is likely to end up in disaster.|$|E

25|$|It was at {{this event}} that the Swedish {{tradition}} of fancy diving {{was introduced to the}} sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.|$|E
500|$|Local traders, unhappy that {{visitors}} were not coming {{as far as}} the centre of the town, built a new pier closer to the main streets. Opened in 1904, and known as the Grand Pier, it was designed to be [...] long. Further development occurred after World War I, with the Winter Gardens Pavilion in 1927, the open air pool, with its arched concrete <b>diving</b> <b>board,</b> and an airfield dating from the inter-war period. Art Deco influences can be seen in much of the town's architecture from this period.|$|E
500|$|In the Spring of 1931, Morgan offered several {{designs for}} Hearst's consideration, {{all of them}} using the stones of the Spanish monastery on the ground floor, {{reinforced}} by steel girders to take {{the weight of the}} upper floors. Portions of the monastery were considered as a library, an [...] "armory", and a living room. The final proposal from Morgan included an indoor swimming pool constructed from the monastery's old church. The [...] long swimming pool featured changing rooms and lounges in the old side chapels, shallow water for wading in the apse, [...] deep water in the central plunge, and a <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> where the altar had been.|$|E

One night, Barris finds Byrd sitting atop the <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> of his backyard pool. Byrd reveals to Barris {{why he was}} chosen by the CIA to become an assassin: he {{is the son of}} a serial killer and had been raised as a girl by his mother, so he [...] "fit the profile". Barris threatens Byrd, and after Byrd is killed moments later, Barris is seen pointing his gun at him.|$|E
500|$|Another {{principal}} {{topic of}} discussion among critics has been True Detective auteurist sensibility. Auteurism is a critical framework that assesses films or other works of art as reflections of the personal vision of individual authors, typically a director or writer. At the helm {{of each of the}} season's episodes are Pizzolatto and Fukunaga—its sole writer and director—a partnership that provides the show a unique place in a traditionally collaborative medium where broad sets of writers and directors work in tandem. Colin Robertson at The List saw Twin Peaks as the most notable artistic antecedent to True Detective first season because both shows challenge crime drama cliches and [...] "use the genre conventions of a whodunnit-style mystery as a sublimely subversive <b>diving</b> <b>board,</b> and leap off from there to tell a broader story." ...|$|E

Death is summoned to The Drunken Clam on a false alarm (thinking that Horace had died), and decides to grant Peter's wish by sending him, along with Brian, back to 1984 for one night. He notices his friend Cleveland, in his '80s look, who high-fives him around the pool. He then sees 18-year-old Lois Pewterschmidt walking around the country club pool, taking her high-heeled shoes off and jumping off the <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> into the pool with [...] "Mr. Night" [...] playing in the background, a {{reference}} to Caddyshack. [...] Appearing to others as his 18-year-old self, Peter cancels his scheduled movie date to see Zapped! with Lois, instead accepting an invitation from Cleveland to go and party at a bar. Peter enjoys the evening, and ends up making out with actress Molly Ringwald before Death appears to return him to the present.|$|E

500|$|The stress {{fracture}} theory {{was supported by}} the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973, testified that [...] "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> after somebody has jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure, [...] "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." [...] George H. [...] "Red" [...] Burgner, Fitzgeralds steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a [...] "loose keel" [...] contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that [...] "the keel and sister kelsons were only 'tack welded'" [...] and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.|$|E
500|$|Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put {{together}} a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing out to you, {{in regard to the}} matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based." [...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> flapping a towel and exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!" [...] Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget.|$|E

The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high <b>diving</b> <b>board,</b> even though {{he did not know how}} to swim. He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, he tried to keep his lessons a secret, but word got out and he was ridiculed and bullied every single day for the rest of his school days. [...] "I was a skinny kid. They could have crushed me in an instant," [...] he stated.|$|E

500|$|Rod Pont (also {{known as}} Steve Day in Steve Day and the Drifters) remembered Storm {{arriving}} at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a boil on his face. When told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on. At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, Garston, Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a torch, which Storm used to finish the concert. He occasionally used a pet monkey {{in some of the}} group's performances, as it attracted more people. At a New Brighton swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top <b>diving</b> <b>board,</b> undressed to a pair of swimming trunks, and then dived into the water {{at the end of a}} song. In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, Birkenhead, he climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell [...] to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the Pavilion roof but fell through the glass skylight.|$|E

It is also featured on the DualDisc edition of the album #1's {{as well as on}} the Japanese version of the DVD [...] In 2013, it was included on the album Destiny's Child Video Anthology which contained every music video the group had filmed during their career. An image taken from the video of [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was used as the cover artwork for the DVD. The video opens with a fast instance of a sun rising in the sky and moves to the girls standing nude together. Each singer is featured in her own desert scene performing individually during her respective verse; Beyoncé is seen on a <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> next to a swimming pool, Rowland on a deserted road where she dances next to a silver car from which she had previously got out of and Williams on a sunlounger. During the chorus the group members are seen wearing fishtail evening dresses, performing a choreographed dance routine for the camera and three males who watch them from the side; the men are never filmed in the same shot as Destiny's Child. During the end, each member is seen together with one of their male partners and the video fades away showing the trio nude again as during the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Griswold {{organized}} many of {{the skilled}} athletes at the university into a circus team, putting on shows. He also developed an act in the swimming pool which involved Griswold clowning and performing tricks on the <b>diving</b> <b>board.</b> This would later be developed into an entertaining routine which he performed professionally for years. In {{one of his most}} famous routines he would pretend to be a drunken, uncoordinated man who was constantly staggering off of the <b>diving</b> <b>board</b> and its ladder as he ostensibly got ready for a big dive. Audiences would gasp as he repeatedly [...] "fell" [...] from the board only to seemingly catch himself at the last moment.|$|E
