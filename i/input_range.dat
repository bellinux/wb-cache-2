50|$|Data {{acquisition}} hardware for {{acoustic measurements}} typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, and other signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency {{range of the}} instrumentation. It should {{be large enough to}} cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one-half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an <b>input</b> <b>range</b> of ±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 µV. Thus, the <b>input</b> <b>range</b> and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system.

This becomes advantageous when one or more inputs is constrained to a small enough range that the results can be stored in a reasonably sized block of memory. Because memory access is essentially constant in time complexity (except for caching delays), any algorithm with a component which has worse than constant efficiency over a small <b>input</b> <b>range</b> can be improved by precomputing values. In some cases efficient approximation algorithms can be obtained by computing a discrete subset of values and interpolating for intermediate input values, since interpolation is also a linear operation.|$|E
50|$|A {{voltage divider}} {{can be used}} to scale down a very high voltage {{so that it can be}} {{measured}} by a volt meter.

High voltage resistor divider probes designed specifically for this purpose {{can be used to}} measure voltages up to 100 kV. Special high-voltage resistors are used in such probes as they must be able to tolerate high input voltages and, to produce accurate results, must have matched temperature coefficients and very low voltage coefficients. Capacitive divider probes are typically used for voltages above 100 kV, as the heat caused by power losses in resistor divider probes at such high voltages could be excessive.|$|E
