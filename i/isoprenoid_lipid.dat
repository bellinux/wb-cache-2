The bulk cell material was 13 depleted in 13 C relative to the dissolved inorganic carbon. Evidently, inorganic carbon fixation by the main carboxylating enzymes used by C. aurantiacus, which are assumed to use bicarbonate rather than CO 2, results in a relatively small carbon isotopic fractionation compared with CO 2 fixation by the Calvin cycle. Even carbon numbered fatty acids, odd carbon numbered fatty acids, and <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipids</b> were 14, 15, and 17 - 18 depleted in 13 C relative to the carbon source, respectively.

The prenyltransferases and other components of the mevalonate pathway are either present or potential drug targets for cancer, osteoporosis, restenosis, or high serum cholesterol level. Until recently, cellular assays to study protein prenylation have been tedious, low-throughput assays. The authors have developed a high-content imaging-based assay to study protein prenylation. The assay {{is based on a}} green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, which is tagged with the prenylation motif of human H-Ras. The C-terminus of H-Ras targets GFP to the plasma membrane. When protein prenylation is inhibited, the tagged GFP cannot be localized to plasma membrane but is soluble in the cells. The localization of the GFP reporter can be analyzed in the 96 - or 384 -well format using automated microscopy and automated image analy-sis. Information about cell number and nuclear intensity can be obtained from the same images. In compound screening, these readouts provide valuable information about the toxicity of the compounds.

N-BPs likely inhibit this enzyme by mimicking {{one or more of the}} natural <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipid</b> substrates (GPP/DMAPP and IPP) but the mode of inhibition is not established. The active site of FPPS comprises a subsite for each substrate. Kinetic studies with recombinant human FPPS indicate that both potent (risedronate) and weak (NE- 58051) enzyme inhibitors compete with GPP for binding to FPPS, however, binding to this site does not completely explain the difference in potency of the two inhibitors, suggesting that a second binding site may also be a target of bisphosphonate inhibition. Using the docking software suite Autodock, we explored a dual inhibitor binding mode for recombinant human FPPS. Experimental support for dual binding is suggested by Dixon plots for the inhibitors.

A major class of proteins that are affected are small GTPases, including Rac 1 and RhoA. It is not clear how protein prenylation of small GTPases relates to GTP hydrolysis activity and downstream signaling. Here, we investigated the contribution of RhoA prenylation to the biochemical pathways that underlie MKD-associated IL- 1 β hypersecretion using human cell cultures, Rac 1 and RhoA protein variants, and pharmacological inhibitors. We found that when unprenylated, the GTP-bound levels of RhoA decrease, causing a reduction in GTPase activity and increased protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation. Cells expressing unprenylated RhoA produce increased levels of interleukin 1 β mRNA. Of other phenotypic cellular changes seen in MKD, increased mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial elongation, only mitochondrial elongation was observed. Finally, we show that pharmacological inactivation of RhoA boosts Rac 1 activity, a small GTPase whose activity was earlier implied in MKD pathogenesis.

Although the biological consequences of prenylation have been characterized extensively, the contributions of prenylcysteine methylation to the functions of the modified proteins are not well understood. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt). Recent genetic disruption studies have provided strong evidence that blocking Icmt activity has profound consequences on oncogenic transformation. Here, we report the identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of Icmt, 2 -[5 -(3 -methylphenyl) - 1 -octyl- 1 H-indol- 3 -yl]acetamide (cysmethynil). Cysmethynil treatment results in inhibition of cell growth in an Icmt-dependent fashion, demonstrating mechanism-based activity of the compound. Treatment of cancer cells with cysmethynil results in mislocalization of Ras and impaired epidermal growth factor signaling.

HGPS is almost always caused by a de novo point mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA) that activates a cryptic splice donor site, producing a truncated mutant protein termed “progerin. ” WT prelamin A is anchored to the nuclear envelope by a farnesyl <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipid.</b> Cleavage of the terminal 15 aa and the farnesyl group releases mature lamin A from this tether. In contrast, this cleavage site is deleted in progerin. We hypothesized that retention of the farnesyl group causes progerin to become permanently anchored in the nuclear membrane, disrupting proper nuclear scaffolding and causing the characteristic nuclear blebbing seen in HGPS cells. Also, we hypothesized that blocking farnesylation would decrease progerin toxicity. To test this hypothesis, the terminal CSIM sequence in progerin was mutated to SSIM, a sequence that cannot be farnesylated. SSIM progerin relocalized from the nuclear periphery into nucleoplasmic aggregates and produced no nuclear blebbing. Also, blocking farnesylation of authentic progerin in transiently transfected HeLa, HEK 293, and NIH 3 T 3 cells with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) restored normal nuclear architecture.

We proposed here a way to induce the death of gene modified cells upon request by acting on a pro-apoptotic protein cellular localization and on the activation of its apoptotic function. Results We constructed an adenoviral vector coding a chimeric p 53 protein by fusing p 53 sequence with the 21 COOH term amino acids sequence of H-Ras. Indeed, the translation products of Ras genes are cytosolic proteins that become secondarily associated with membranes through a series of post-translational modifications initiated by a CAAX motif present at the C terminus of Ras proteins. The chimeric p 53 HRCaax protein was farnesylated efficiently in transduced human osteosarcoma p 53 -/- cell line. The farnesylated form of p 53 resided mainly in the cytosol, where it is non-functional. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) specifically inhibited farnesyl <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipid</b> modification of proteins. Following treatment of the cells with an FTI, p 53 HRCaax underwent translocation into the nucleus where it retained transcription factor activity. Shifting p 53 into the nucleus resulted in the induction of p 21 waf 1 /CIP 1 and Bax transcription, cell growth arrest, caspase activation and apoptosis. Conclusion Artificial protein farnesylation impaired the transcriptional activity of p 53. This could be prevented by Farnesyl transferase inhibition.

The focus of this project is on the fungal organism Aspergillus fumigatus, a major opportunistic human pathogen of invasive aspergillosis that is becoming more common among transplant recipients and cancer and AIDS patients. To approach inhibitor design for A. fumigatus protein prenyltransferases, I have described a 1. 5 Å X-ray crystal structure of the A. fumigatus protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) in complex with farnesyl diphosphate and its active site features that include isoprenoid and peptide binding conformations, zinc coordination, and product exit groove. Additionally, an in vitro fluorescence-based activity assay was used to partially characterize the peptide substrate specificity of the enzyme. I have also obtained crystal structures of the A. fumigatus FTase in complex with two ethylenediamine-scaffold compounds and evaluated the binding mode and selectivity of the compounds relative to that in mammalian FTase. Given the limited effectiveness of current antifungal therapies, the work presented here may lead to the design of new fungal inhibitors with improved selectivity. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{thrives in}} many aqueous environments {{and is an}} {{opportunistic}} pathogen that can cause both acute and chronic infections. Environmental conditions and host defenses cause differing stresses on the bacteria, and to survive in vastly different environments, P. aeruginosa {{must be able to}} adapt to its surroundings. One strategy for bacterial adaptation is to self-encapsulate with matrix material, primarily composed of secreted extracellular polysaccharides. P. aeruginosa has the genetic capacity to produce at least three secreted polysaccharides; alginate, Psl and Pel. These polysaccharides differ in chemical structure and in their biosynthetic mechanisms. Since alginate is often associated with chronic pulmonary infections, its biosynthetic pathway is the best characterized. However, alginate is only produced by a subset of P. aeruginosa strains. Most environmental and other clinical isolates secrete either Pel or Psl. Little information is available on the biosynthesis of these polysaccharides. Here, we review the literature on the alginate biosynthetic pathway, with emphasis on recent findings describing the structure of alginate biosynthetic proteins. This information combined with the characterization of the domain architecture of proteins encoded on the psl and pel operons allowed us to make predictive models for the biosynthesis of these two polysaccharides. The results indicate that alginate and Pel share certain features, including some biosynthetic proteins with structurally or functionally similar properties. In contrast, Psl biosynthesis resembles the EPS/CPS capsular biosynthesis pathway of Escherichia coli, where the Psl pentameric subunits are assembled in association with an <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipid</b> carrier. These models and the environmental cues that cause the cells to produce predominantly one polysaccharide over the others are subjects of current investigation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{integrating}} viral vectors in Gene therapy clinical trials {{has pointed out}} {{the problem of the}} deleterous effect of the integration of the ectopic gene to the cellular genome and the safety of this strategy. We proposed here a way to induce the death of gene modified cells upon request by acting on a pro-apoptotic protein cellular localization and on the activation of its apoptotic function. RESULTS: We constructed an adenoviral vector coding a chimeric p 53 protein by fusing p 53 sequence with the 21 COOH term amino acids sequence of H-Ras. Indeed, the translation products of Ras genes are cytosolic proteins that become secondarily associated with membranes through a series of post-translational modifications initiated by a CAAX motif present at the C terminus of Ras proteins. The chimeric p 53 HRCaax protein was farnesylated efficiently in transduced human osteosarcoma p 53 -/- cell line. The farnesylated form of p 53 resided mainly in the cytosol, where it is non-functional. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) specifically inhibited farnesyl <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipid</b> modification of proteins. Following treatment of the cells with an FTI, p 53 HRCaax underwent translocation into the nucleus where it retained transcription factor activity. Shifting p 53 into the nucleus resulted in the induction of p 21 waf 1 /CIP 1 and Bax transcription, cell growth arrest, caspase activation and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Artificial protein farnesylation impaired the transcriptional activity of p 53. This could be prevented by Farnesyl transferase inhibition. These data highlight the fact that the artificial prenylation of proteins provides a novel system for controlling the function of a transactivating factor...|$|E
40|$|Subunit {{vaccines}} {{capable of}} providing protective immunity against the intracellular pathogens and cancers that kill millions of people annually require an adjuvant capable of directing a sufficiently potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to purified antigens, without toxicity issues. Archaeosome lipid vesicles, prepared from <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipids</b> extracted from archaea, are one such adjuvant in development. Here, the stability of an archaeal core lipid 2, 3 -di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (archaeol) is used to advantage to synthesize a series of disaccharide archaeols and show that subtle variations in the carbohydrate head group alters the type and potency of immune responses mounted in a mammal. Critically, a glycosylarchaeol was required to elicit high cytotoxic CD 8 (+) T cell activity, with highest responses to the antigen entrapped in archaeosomes containing disaccharides of glucose in beta- or alpha 1 - 6 linkage (beta-gentiobiose, beta-isomaltose), or of beta-lactose. This first study on synthetic archaeal lipid adjuvants reveals potential for this class of regulatory friendly, easily scalable, inexpensive, and potent glyco-adjuvantPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Intact polar lipids (IPLs) are {{considered}} biomarkers for living biomass. Their degradation in marine sediments, however, is poorly understood and complicates interpretation of their occurrence in geological samples. To investigate the turnover of IPLs, a degradation experiment with anoxic sandy sediments from the North Sea was conducted. Intact cells of two organisms {{that do not}} naturally occur in North Sea sediments were chosen as IPL sources: (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae, representative for ester-bound acyl lipids that also occur in Bacteria, and (ii) the archaeon Haloferax volcanii, representative for ether-bound <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipids.</b> Surprisingly, IPLs with phosphoester-bound head groups showed approximately the same degradation rate as IPLs with glycosidic head groups. Furthermore, the results indicate a relatively fast degradation of S. cerevisiae IPLs with ester-bound moieties (analogs of bacterial membrane lipids) and no significant degradation of archaeal IPLs with ether-bound moieties. Pore water and 16 S rRNA-based DGGE analysis showed only a minor influence of the IPL source on microbial metabolism and community profiles. Due to our results, the IPL-based quantification of Archaea and Bacteria should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Archaea are {{ubiquitous}} {{and abundant}} microorganisms on Earth that mediate key global biogeochemical cycles. The headgroup {{attached to the}} sn- 1 position in the glycerol backbone and the ether-linked <b>isoprenoid</b> <b>lipids</b> are among the diagnostic traits that distinguish Archaea from Bacteria and Eukarya. Over the last 30 years, numerous archaeal lipids were purified and described in pure cultures. Coupled high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS) now enables the detection and rapid identification of intact polar lipids in relatively small samples, revealing {{a wide range of}} archaeal lipids in natural environments. Although major structural groups have been identified, the lack of a systematic evaluation of MS/MS fragmentation patterns has hindered the characterization of several atypical components that are therefore considered as unknowns. Here, we examined mass spectra resulting from lipid analysis of natural microbial communities using HPLC/electrospray ionization (ESI) / ITMSn, and depicted the systematics in MS 2 fragmentation of intact archaeal lipids. This report will be particularly useful for biochemists and geochemists interested in a rapid and straightforward characterization of intact archaeal membrane lipids...|$|R
