This electrical compromise gives a gain and linearity equal to the best traits of both extremes. In a 1951 engineering paper published by David Hafler and Herbert Keroes, they determined that when the screen tap was set to approximately 43% of anode voltage, an optimized condition within the output stage occurred, which they referred to as ultra-linear. By the late 1950s, this design became the dominant configuration for high-fidelity PP amplifiers.|$|E

While many industrial flows are highly turbulent, models have rarely been tested to explore whether their accuracy withstands such augmented free-stream turbulence intensity or declines to an erroneous solution. In the present study, the turbulence intensity of an air flow stream, moving parallel to a flat plate is augmented by the means of locating a <b>grid</b> <b>screen</b> at a point at which Rex= 2. 5 × 105 and the effect on the flow and the near-wall boundary is studied.

40|$|Abstract FAP 52 (focal {{adhesion}} protein, 52 kDa) is a focal adhesion-associated protein {{composed of}} a highly α-helical NH 2 -terminus containing a poorly characterized FCH (Fes/CIP 4 homology) domain, unstructured linker region and the COOH-terminal SH 3 domain. FAP 52 {{is also known as}} PACSIN 2 or syndapin II. Together with other PACSINs and syndapins FAP 52 shares a common domain architecture. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize FAP 52 in structural and functional terms. The function was pursued by identifying binding partners for FAP 52, and by overexpressing the recombinant FAP 52 in cultured cells. For the structural studies, various physico-chemical methods, such as chemical cross-linking, gel filtration chromatography, circular dichroism and X-ray crystallography were applied. In addition, the histological distribution of FAP 52 in chicken tissues was explored. FAP 52 binds filamin, a protein that regulates the dynamics of the cytoskeleton by crosslinking actin filaments. The binding site in FAP 52 was mapped to the NH 2 -terminal 184 amino acids, of which the residues 146 – 184 form the core of the binding. In filamin, the binding site resides in the repeats 15 – 16 in the rod-like molecule encompassing 24 such repetitive domains. Overexpression of FAP 52 or its filamin-binding domain in chicken embryo heart fibroblasts induced the formation of filopodial extensions on the cell surface and reduced the number of focal adhesions, suggesting a role in the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton and in cell adhesion machinery. Experiments utilizing surface plasmon resonance analysis, size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking showed that FAP 52 self-associates in vitro and in vivo. The region responsible for the self-association was mapped to the amino acids 146 – 280, which is predicted to fold into a coiled-coil arrangement. FAP 52 was crystallized by using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method and ammonium sulfate <b>grid</b> <b>screen.</b> Native dataset was collected from two crystals, which diffracted to 2. 8 Å and 2. 1 Å resolution. For one form of crystals, phasing was performed using the native dataset and the datasets from two xenon-derivatized crystals. X-ray crystallography studies revealed a dimer in asymmetric unit. Histological and in vitro studies showed that, in liver, FAP 52 is preferentially expressed in bile canaliculi. In other tissues, FAP 52 showed a specific staining pattern in gut, kidney, brain and gizzard. Together, these data show that FAP 52 self-associates in vivo and, probably via its interaction with its binding partner filamin, participates in the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture, especially of the cell surface protrusions, such as filopodia and microvilli of bile canaliculi...|$|E

5000|$|The transitron oscillator, {{invented by}} Cledo Brunetti in 1939, (although {{a similar effect}} was {{observed}} in tetrodes by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, and Edward Herold described a similar oscillator in 1935) is a negative resistance oscillator circuit using a pentode vacuum tube, in which, instead of the plate, the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> has negative resistance due to being coupled to the suppressor grid. [...] See the circuit at right. In the transitron, the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> is biased at a positive voltage (battery B1) above the plate voltage while the suppressor grid is biased negatively (battery B2), at or below the cathode voltage. Therefore, all the electrons will be reflected by the negative suppressor grid and none will get through to the plate. The reflected electrons will instead be attracted to the <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> so the <b>screen</b> current will be high while the plate current will be zero. However, if the suppressor grid voltage is increased, as it approaches zero (the cathode voltage) electrons will begin to pass through it and reach the plate, so the number diverted to the <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> and thus the screen current, will decrease. Since the other grids don't take significant current the cathode current [...] is split between the plate [...] and the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> : The division of current between the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> and plate {{is controlled by the}} suppressor voltage. This inverse relationship is indicated by saying the transconductance between the <b>screen</b> and suppressor <b>grid</b> (the change in screen current ΔIG2 divided by the change in suppressor voltage ΔVG3) is negative.|$|R

50|$|However, the tetrode kink {{limits the}} {{permissible}} variation of anode voltage, and restricts {{the use of}} screen-grid valves to small-signal applications. The suppressor grid of the pentode eliminates the kink in the anode characteristic by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification. The same effect can be produced {{in the case of}} a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> and the anode. The intense negative space charge of these beams prevents secondary electrons from the anode from reaching the <b>screen</b> <b>grid,</b> thus eliminated the tetrode kink. Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> and the anode. The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder. (See sectional view, right). Successful creation of the electron beam between <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> and anode required for a kinkless anode characteristic depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more. The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration). The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.|$|R

This is sometimes provided as an option in audiophile pentode amplifier circuits, to give the sought-after [...] "sonic qualities" [...] of a triode power amplifier. A resistor may be included in series with the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> to avoid exceeding the <b>screen</b> <b>grid's</b> power or voltage rating, and to prevent local oscillation. Triode-connection is a useful option for audiophiles who wish to avoid the expense of 'true' power triodes.|$|R
40|$|Results of {{the first}} probing of the screen hole sheath of an ion {{accelerator}} system are presented. The screen hole sheath, represented {{as a set of}} equipotential contours, extends over a large distance within the discharge plasma. Under no conditions examined does the sheath enter the screen hole. Edge hole defocusing of multiaperture accelerator systems is due primarily to local plasma density variations rather than adjacent screen hole sheath interactions. The sheath boundary is independent of screen-to-accelerator grid spacing when the grid set is operated at the minimum ion beam divergence condition. Significant ion focusing effects occur in the sheath adjacent to the <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> webbing leading to increased ion source beam current efficiency with decreasing screen-to-accelerator <b>grid</b> separation and/or <b>screen</b> <b>grid</b> thickness...|$|R
50|$|The LEED {{contains}} a retarding field analyzer to block inelastically scattered electrons.Because only spherical fields around the sampled point are allowed and {{the geometry of}} the sample {{and the surrounding area}} is not spherical, no field is allowed. Therefore, the first <b>grid</b> <b>screens</b> separates the space above the sample from the retarding field. The next grid is at a potential to block low energy electrons, it is called the suppressor or the gate. To make the retarding field homogeneous and mechanically more stable this grid often consists of two grids. The fourth grid is only necessary when the LEED is used like a tetrode and the current at the screen is measured, when it serves as screen between the gate and the anode.|$|R
