Since I could not locate enough work where I was living, I decided to start up another company, so I borrowed on my credit cards and started Blackthorne."

At that time, I will be repentant too--let him know it then--and think that when I thought so much of all the causes that had made me what <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> allowed more for the causes that had made him what he was.

This was exactly the question which <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> put <b>to</b> me. For, intellectually speaking, I had believed in Jesus all my life, {{on the other side}} of the door. I <b>had</b> regularly struggled <b>to</b> say my prayers through the key-hole. I had even pushed pennies under the door in a vain attempt to pacify him. I had been baptized, yes and confirmed as well. I went to church, read my Bible, had high ideals, and tried to be good and do good. But all the time, often without realising it, I was holding Christ at arm's length, and keeping him outside. I knew that to open the door might have momentous consequences. I am profoundly grateful to him for enabling me to open the door. Looking back now over more than fifty years, I realise that that simple step has changed the entire direction, course and quality of my life.|$|R
2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means <b>having</b> <b>to</b> use more of your brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands." [...] Brown has worked with the Foundation Fighting Blindness to raise awareness of the disease.|$|R
