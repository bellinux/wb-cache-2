5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on <b>its</b> <b>axis.</b> Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is {{the angular}} motion {{of a star}} about <b>its</b> <b>axis.</b> The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is probably a captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5000|$|A flip {{trick is}} a type of {{skateboard}}ing trick in which the skateboard rotates around <b>its</b> vertical <b>axis,</b> or <b>its</b> vertical <b>axis</b> and <b>its</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> simultaneously. The first flip trick called a kickflip, originally called a [...] "magic flip," [...] was invented by professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen.|$|R
50|$|Any Kerr-Newman source has <b>its</b> {{rotation}} <b>axis</b> {{aligned with}} <b>its</b> magnetic <b>axis.</b> Thus, a Kerr-Newman source {{is different from}} commonly observed astronomical bodies, {{for which there is}} a substantial angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment.|$|R
5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotelian {{model was}} {{accepted}} in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> and if the sun were placed {{at the center of}} the Universe.|$|E
50|$|The Voyager 2 images show Belinda as an {{elongated}} object with <b>its</b> major <b>axis</b> pointing towards Uranus. The moon is very elongated, with <b>its</b> short <b>axis</b> 0.5 ± 0.1 times the long axis. Its surface is grey in color.|$|R
50|$|Urup has {{a roughly}} {{rectangular}} shape, measuring 120 km along <b>its</b> long <b>axis</b> and approximately 20 km along <b>its</b> narrow <b>axis.</b> It {{is the fourth}} largest of the Kuril Islands, with an area of 1,430 km2. The highest point is Gora Ivao at 1426 m.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reference}} ellipsoid is usually defined by <b>its</b> semi-major <b>axis</b> (equatorialradius) [...] and either <b>its</b> semi-minor <b>axis</b> (polar radius) , aspect ratio [...] or flattening , but GRS80 is an exception: For a complete definition, four independent constants are required. GRS80 chooses as these , , [...] and , making the geometrical constant [...] a derived quantity.|$|R
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates about <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> {{in about}} the same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The dart is a non-convex {{quadrilateral}} whose four {{interior angles}} are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> of symmetry {{to form a}} pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.|$|E
5|$|The kite is a {{quadrilateral}} whose four {{interior angles}} are 72, 72, 72, and 144 degrees. The kite may be bisected along <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> of symmetry {{to form a}} pair of acute Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 72 and 72 degrees).|$|E
5000|$|The Pumapunku is a terraced earthen mound that {{is faced}} with blocks. It is 167.36 m wide along <b>its</b> north-south <b>axis</b> and 116.7 m long along <b>its</b> east-west <b>axis.</b> On the {{northeast}} and southeast corners of the Pumapunku, it has 20 m wide projections that extend 27.6 m north and south from the rectangular mound.|$|R

5|$|Westerly monsoon winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly {{trade winds}} exist poleward of the trough. Right along <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> heavy rains {{can be found}} which usher in the peak of a location's {{respective}} rainy season. As it passes poleward of a location, hot and dry conditions develop. The monsoon trough {{plays a role in}} creating many of the world's rainforests.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on <b>its</b> <b>axis.</b> On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around <b>its</b> <b>axis,</b> {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.|$|E
5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on <b>its</b> <b>axis</b> and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
