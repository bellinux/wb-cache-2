25|$|Although short-lived, Sămănătorul {{was a major}} {{influence}} on later Romanian literature and culture in <b>general.</b> Its <b>legacy</b> stood at the center of cultural debates between traditionalism and modernism lasting throughout the 20th century. While Iorga personally tried to revive it with the magazines Drum Drept and Cuget Clar, Sămănătorism was adopted by other traditionalist or agrarian currents, and was a contributing factor to the cultural tenets of local far right and fascist groups. During the interwar period, it also made a significant impact in Bessarabia (a region since divided between Moldova and Ukraine). The Sămănătorist ideology itself was traditionally criticized for encouraging isolationism and xenophobia, as well as for its flirtation with antisemitism. In literary and art criticism, the term Sămănătorist acquired pejorative connotations, denoting specific pastoral and patriotic clichés.|$|R

Although there were always multiple layers of Lincoln representations in Germany, the dominant images were: the national unifier, the libertarian universalist, the emancipator, the defender of moral values, the modernizer, the democrat who used the power of the democratic state, the egalitarian self-made man from humble origins, and the defender of social justice and workingmen’s rights...|$|R

Soyinka further noted that by honoring Abacha, the government of Goodluck Jonathan had gathered [...] "a century’s accumulated degeneracy in one preeminent symbol, then place it on a podium for the nation to admire, emulate and even – worship".

40|$|This essay {{presents}} and contrasts two narratives {{on the past}} and future {{of the law of}} Aboriginal title. The first narrative, drawn from the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, grounds the law of Aboriginal title in inter-societal norms that enabled the mutual coexistence of colonists and settlers in North America. It locates Aboriginal territorial dispossession in colonial policies and practices that failed to conform to the spirit of mutual coexistence, and calls on governments to provide Aboriginal people with lands and resources necessary for self-sufficiency. The counter-narrative describes the law of Aboriginal title as a relatively minor exception to a more <b>general</b> legal <b>legacy</b> of Aboriginal territorial dispossession. It argues that the law should acknowledge that it has produced unjust distributions of title in Canada. It calls on the law of Aboriginal title to allocate proprietary power to Aboriginal people in ways that force governments to introduce reforms similar to those recommended by the Royal Commission...|$|R

This study {{analyzes}} the Danubian {{front of the}} Crimean War, which includes the military activities in the Ottoman Bulgaria, Dobruja and the Principalities. A comparison between Russian and Ottoman military activities in the Balkan theater helps to explain the “Ottoman and Russian War of 1853 - 1856 ” separate from the existing Eurocentric literature. This study not only explains the war {{as a product of}} interstate politics but also concentrates on the individual participants, both combatants and civilians. Logistics, intelligence activities, and prisoners of war will be focused on in addition to the battles to discuss the Danubian front from a broader perspective. There are three main chapters discussing the Danubian front of the Crimean War: “before the front”, “at the front” and “behind the front”.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} {{insights}} into the reality of human decision-making, is an important challenge for today’s policymakers. Are there `cheaper´, more efficient and possibly as well more effective, non-financial ways of influencing the behaviour of private and corporate citizens, nudging them towards socially desired choices, for example, {{in the domain of}} energy consumption? Can such mechanisms complement or substitute for monetary incentives in fostering sustainable decision-making in policy relevant areas such as energy consumption? If so, what mechanisms might be feasible to implement in actual policymaking? Against this background, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (Ministerie van Economische Zaken) wants to know which “nudges” are the most suitable for application in the field of energy conservation. To this end, in this report we (1) take stock what is known about the effects of non-monetary incentives in <b>general,</b> and <b>legacy</b> reminders in particular, in increasing individuals’ regard for collective interests and for intergenerational beneficence, in particular in the domain of energy consumption (literature review); (2) investigate in a laboratory setting the effects of selected non-monetary incentives on a selection of relevant decision tasks (laboratory experiments); and (3) apply the insights from the literature review and laboratory experiments to specific instruments of policy-making in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} magical procedures (prayers, songs, charms) {{and practices}} against natural calamity in mountain villages (in {{the south of}} Poland) {{in the context of}} a human shape called weather wizard. He was created on the base of the beliefs in air demons (płanetnik, chmurnik, obłocznik), as a mediator between people and demons. The weather wizard had two types of roles. The first one comprised “cooperation” with air demons, whereas the second included independent practices related to protecting the village from storms. Magic procedures used by weather wizards included verbal formulas, certain types of behaviour, as well as religious and magical accessories and property. The formulas constituted a mixture of a magic spell and a prayer to God. Apart from weather wizards’ practices, magic activities were popular among village inhabitants. For example they ploughed the village borders, placed “relics” along these borders, burnt flour or blessed herbs, ringed, danced, sang songs. Opposing the elements in the form of spells, entreaties, threats, noise making, sacrifices with the participation of a mediator (weather wizard) or without, is in <b>general</b> a <b>legacy</b> of the past related to traditional culture.
