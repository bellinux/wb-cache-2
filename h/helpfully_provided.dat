500|$|British {{official}} broadcaster Channel 4 {{received some}} criticism for {{its coverage of}} the Paralympics. Users of Twitter complained that its coverage of the opening ceremony contained too many commercial breaks, drawing comparisons to similar complaints faced by NBC during the Olympics' opening ceremony; unlike the BBC, who televised the Olympics in the United Kingdom, both NBC and Channel 4 are supported by advertising. Complaints noted that Channel 4 had shown five ad breaks within the first hour of the ceremony, and that ironically, it had recently broadcast a six-hour long late-night dance music special with no adverts at all. Channel 4 defended the criticism by stating that it had broadcast [...] "significantly fewer" [...] commercials than normal for primetime programming during the ceremony, and that the ad breaks were {{needed in order to}} help the channel invest in broadcasting programming such as the Paralympics. Criticism was also made towards comments made by Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy during the telecast; Snow was criticized for making comments about war-torn countries during the parade of nations, while Guru-Murthy received similar criticism for quipping that [...] "looking at the ages of these athletes, which have been <b>helpfully</b> <b>provided</b> to us, they're really quite old." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{province}} is frequently {{referred to as}} [...] "English Canada" [...] after the Union of the Canadas, and its ethnic homogeneity {{said to be a}} factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, {{it is interesting to note}} the range of ethnic groups in Upper Canada. However, due to the lack of a detailed breakdown, it is difficult to count each group, and this may be considered abuse of statistics. An idea of the ethnic breakdown can be had if one considers the religious census of 1842, which is <b>helpfully</b> <b>provided</b> below: Roman Catholics were 15% of the population, and adherents to this religion were, at the time, mainly drawn from the Irish and the French settlers. The Roman Catholic faith also numbered some votaries from amongst the Scottish settlers.

40|$|This is {{the most}} recent {{publication}} produced {{by the members of}} the Arbeitskreis Asiatische Religionsgeschichte (AKAR, founded in 1998), a study group affiliated to the German Association for the History of Religions. It contains twelve contributions (the blurb mistakenly gives eleven) most of which are based on papers presented at a workshop of the study group in Weikersheim (Germany) in February 2002. The book discusses new and critical approaches to Edward Said’s concept of “orientalism”, drawing attention to the manifold and complex discourses and debates about and within religions of different geographical areas in Asia and presenting case studies from different time periods. The book, whose title Religion im Spiegelkabinett can be literally translated as “religion in a maze of mirrors” is mainly written in German, but a detailed abstract of the entire volume by editor-inchief Peter Schalk, as well as abstracts of the ten German articles in English, are <b>helpfully</b> <b>provided</b> for those who need it.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{departs from}} {{the assumption that}} the allocation of limited (public) rights in the EU and its Member States is in need of a consistent and general legal theory. The editors of this book assume that inspiration for such an approach may be drawn from the phenomenon of public procurement and its EU regulation. The question dealt with in this contribution is whether and to what extent this is indeed possible. In order to answer that question, and for the purpose of {{a better understanding of the}} subject matter, I will first briefly explain what ‘public procurement’ is and how it is generally being organised having regard to both the objectives that can be pursued with it, and the interests that can be affected by it (Section 2). This will provide a basis to answer the question what ‘EU public procurement law’ is, what type of decisions in an ordinary public procurement process it seeks to regulate and, having regard to its objectives, what the content of the regulation in essence is (Section 3). The information gathered in Sections 2 and 3 will thereupon be considered in order to determine whether and to what extent public procurement and its regulation can serve as a source of inspiration for a consistent and general legal theory on the allocation of limited rights. The analysis will start by making some general comments on the position and relevance that the editors have granted to both public procurement and its regulation in this book (Section 4), having regard to their threefold approach of the subject matter of the allocation of limited rights: a conceptual approach (definitions and characteristics), a top-down approach (EU law perspectives) and a bottom-up approach (comparative law perspectives). Subsequently, this contribution will analyse what probably can – and cannot – be learned from public procurement and its regulatory framework with a view to the development of a consistent and general legal theory on the allocation of limited rights, having regard to public procurement’s generic and particular characteristics, objectives, interests involved, and organisation (Section 5). The analysis will deal with issues that have been selected and organised according to the following distinction <b>helpfully</b> <b>provided</b> by the editors: (i) the object of allocation (limited rights), (ii) allocation procedures, and (iii) their legal form. In conclusion, this contribution will provide an answer to the question raised at the beginning of this section and offer a recommendation for the purpose of developing a consistent and general legal approach of the phenomenon of allocation of limited rights (Section 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{are faced}} with the {{prospect}} of a range of possible losses in later life, relating to one's health, functioning and support network. The view of older adults as being destined to experience psychological distress following such events has begun to be challenged by researchers advocating a strength-based approach to later life. This is in stark contrast to the historical, negative discourse in which older adults are seen as passively accepting or struggling with challenges. The construct of resilience is defined as the ability of individuals to either maintain or return to a position of positive well-being following exposure to unfavourable circumstances. Method A review on resilience in old age and its relationship good mental health was conducted. Additionally, qualitative research using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) enabled exploration of resilience in the personal and relational context via eliciting the experience of spouse carers of individuals with dementia. Results The literature suggested a positive relationship between resilience and good mental health in old age. IPA revealed the presence of four key themes for seven spouse carers demonstrating moderate-very high resilience: 'Making sense of loss'; 'Successfully overcoming the 2 challenges of caring'; 'Recognition of my own needs as a carer' and 'Looking into the future'. Conclusion Resilience does not negate the experience of psychological distress altogether; however, older adults faced with a range of adverse circumstances are able to maintain good psychological functioning and manage well by drawing on personal strengths and external resources. In addition to this, the nature of the marital relationship is important to consider in the context of caring in later life. Clinicians must recognise the presence of resilience in later life, with a view to delivering interventions to promote this, whilst also considering the wider context of aging. Longitudinal research would <b>helpfully</b> <b>provide</b> information on the temporal nature of resilience. 3 •. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Two Cultures phenomenon, first {{given its}} name by C. P. Snow in 1956, {{consists}} of a conflict between participants in the academic communities {{of the natural sciences}} and the humanities; it also mirrors the methodological debate in the social sciences. This phenomenon also occurs in undergraduates in an interdisciplinary research fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh called the Brackenridge Fellowship. The phenomenon is not an issue of jargon—it is about people with different interpretive structures coming into conflict. The Two Cultures phenomenon should not be regarded as an anomaly of normally peacefully-interacting academic disciplines. There are issues about the tradition, culture, and epistemology of different academic disciplines that are perceived as deeply and fundamentally different, and it is only through Two Culture conflicts that these differences are thrown into sharp relief. The problem of interdisciplinary misunderstanding is illuminated by viewing understanding as "being able to imagine a question that a statement answers," as developed in the epistemological theory of hermeneuticist Hans-Georg Gadamer. This study examines the Two Cultures phenomenon in the Brackenridge Fellowship using the methodology of hermeneutic phenomenology. It finds that students usually consider the natural sciences objective and the humanities subjective. These perceptions are overgeneralized at best and harmfully false at worst. Students in all disciplines demonstrate a lack of awareness of the traditional and communal basis of interpretation in academic fields. However, these perceptions do help to hold academic disciplines together, as students define their academic identities by using other fields as counter-examples. There are practical implications from this study for liberal education. Colleges and universities should consider general education programming beyond the traditional requisite of requiring several courses in different subject areas. Without an examination of how the structure of general education implies value judgments of academic disciplines and how these fields have ideas that are perceived as conflicting with each other, an important teachable moment is missed. Gadamerian hermeneutics <b>helpfully</b> <b>provides</b> guidance as to how a truly educational conversation can be realized with these issues, through examining the way that traditions are enacted in academic disciplines...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of various commonly applied order selection criteria in selecting order of Autoregressive (AR) process. The most important {{finding of this study}} is that Akaike’s information criterion, Schwarz information criterion, Hannan-Quinn criterion, final prediction error and Bayesian information criterion perform considerably well in estimating the true autoregressive order, even in small sample. Besides, there is no significant gain in differentiating these criteria unless one has a considerable large sample size. This study contributes to the empirical literature by <b>providing</b> <b>helpfully</b> guidelines regarding the use of order selection criteria in determining the autoregressive order. ...|$|R

The most interesting finding {{of this study is that}} Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and final prediction error (FPE) are superior than the other criteria under study in the case of small sample (60 observations and below), in the manners that they minimize the chance of under estimation while maximizing the chance of recovering the true lag length. One immediate econometric implication of this study is that as most economic sample data can seldom be considered “large ” in size, AIC and FPE are recommended for the estimation the autoregressive lag length...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{examination}} (audit) of {{the files}} of patients who had received any mental health services in the year prior to an alleged offence may inform {{our understanding of the}} relationship between mental health and crime. More <b>helpfully,</b> it may <b>provide</b> information to facilitate a reduction in the rate of such tragic events Method: The records of all patients assessed by the Midland Regional Forensic Psychiatric service in the 26 months from January 2010 were screened. The 222 who received a diagnosis of a non-organic psychosis and who were recorded as having offended within one year of a previous psychiatric service attendance formed the cohort. The data extracted from their clinical files, relating primarily to that pre-offence psychiatric contact, included legal, clinical and contextual information. Results: Analysis examined the characteristics of this forensic population and most particularly, of their pre-offending service contact. This identified clinical practice and delivery issues which could reduce the rate of conversion of psychiatric patients to “forensic” status. Conclusions: The results inform issues of effectiveness of adult service delivery with particular consideration of the intensity of clinical contact, antipsychotic drug choice and adherence and the use of assertive treatment...|$|R
