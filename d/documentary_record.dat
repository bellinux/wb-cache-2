5|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> of {{the castle}} dates from 1086 and further {{evidence}} is limited until the 13th century. Robert's son, William, rebelled against William Rufus in 1106, who confiscated the castle. Reginald de Dunstanville held it between 1141 and 1175, and it passed to the then Prince John when he acquired {{the title of the}} Count of Mortain in 1189, and then passed back {{into the hands of the}} Crown after John's rebellion against his brother, Richard I, in 1191.|$|E
5|$|The serious {{collection}} and publication of Washington's <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> {{began with the}} pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s in Life and Writings of George Washington (12 vols., 1834–1837). The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia. The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come. It contains everything written by Washington or signed by him, together with most of his incoming letters. Part of the collection is available online from the University of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> of Urquhart Castle {{occurs in}} 1296, {{when it was}} {{captured}} by Edward I of England. Edward's invasion {{marked the beginning of}} the Wars of Scottish Independence, which would go on intermittently until 1357. Edward appointed Sir William fitz Warin as constable to hold the castle for the English. In 1297 he was ambushed by Sir Andrew de Moray while returning from Inverness, and Moray subsequently laid siege to the castle, launching an unsuccessful night attack. The English must have been dislodged soon after, since in 1298 Urquhart was again controlled by the Scots. In 1303 Sir Alexander de Forbes failed to hold off another English assault. This time Edward installed as governor Alexander Comyn, brother of John, as the family had sided with the English against Robert Bruce. Following his murder of the Red Comyn in 1306, Bruce completed his defeat of the Comyns when he marched through the Great Glen in 1307, taking the castles of Inverlochy, Urquhart and Inverness. After this time Urquhart became a royal castle, held for the crown by a series of constables.|$|E

25|$|A castle {{was built}} in the 12th century by Gilbert de Gant, Earl of Lincoln and {{enlarged}} by Henry Beaumont in the 14th century. He was given a licence to crenelate it in 1312. The last <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> of occupation of this castle dates from 1372. John Leland described it as a ruin in 1535, in which state it survived until the Civil war. The site was later used as the village house of correction.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1054, Ferdinand {{defeated}} his {{elder brother}} García at the Battle of Atapuerca and reduced Navarre to a vassal state under his late brother's young son, Sancho García IV.

Over the next decade, he gradually extended his control over more of the western territory of Navarre {{at the expense of}} Sancho IV, although this was accomplished peacefully and is only detectable in the <b>documentary</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bishop's {{contributions}} to photography were also lasting. When he {{first arrived in}} China in 1915, {{he set out to}} record sites of interest in Peking, and succeeded in photographing most of them. His photographs of imperial sites now stand as almost unique parts of the <b>documentary</b> <b>record.</b> Bishop also used his spare time to photograph street life and social customs, architecture (especially historic buildings), and scenery. These photographs, which Bishop classified with his own system and annotated with extensive notes, were not put on display, but mounted in twelve notebooks, though the negatives were kept in storage at the Smithsonian. Some 4,000 of these images are included in the Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Brill Publishers microform edition.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} at Kolomenskoye, near Moscow, on 18 December 1709 (O.S.), the {{daughter}} of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, by his second wife, Catherine I. Catherine had been a maid in the household of Peter the Great and, although no <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> exists, {{they are said to}} have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in St. Petersburg at some point of time between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Peter valued Catherine and married her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to them (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimized by their father. The circumstances of Elizabeth's birth would later be used by her political opponents to challenge her right to the throne on grounds of illegitimate birth.|$|E
25|$|Stilwell was {{replaced}} by General Albert C. Wedemeyer, who received a telegram from General Marshall on October 27, 1944 directing him to proceed to China to assume command of the China theatre and replace General Stilwell. Wedemeyer later recalled his initial dread over the assignment, as service in the China theater was considered a graveyard for American officials, both military and diplomatic. When Wedemeyer actually arrived at Stilwell’s headquarters after Stilwell’s dismissal, Wedemeyer was dismayed to discover that Stilwell had intentionally departed without seeing him, and did not leave a single briefing paper for his guidance, though departing U.S. military commanders habitually greeted their replacement in order to thoroughly brief them on {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of headquarters staff, the issues confronting the command, and planned operations. Searching the offices, Wedemeyer could find no <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> of Stilwell's plans or records of his former or future operations. General Wedemeyer then spoke with Stilwell’s staff officers but learned little from them because Stilwell, according to the staff, kept everything in his “hip pocket”.|$|E

500|$|Richard, {{although}} he was never to return to England, dispatched the captured French archives to London, where they were deposited in the Tower. As {{a result of this}} battle, Philip became the first French king not to take his archives on campaign with him, as had been customary, but to create the Trésor des Chartes in Paris for permanent deposit in a newly-created new Chancery.

500|$|The reconstructed walls {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of gunports. West Gate was an innovative piece of defensive design in this regard, forming a powerful battery, carefully designed to have a wide angle of covering fire. Positioning of the gunloops is similar to those at Cooling Castle, built around the same time, and gave particular focus to the left flank along North Gate, the most likely route for any attackers. Gunports in south-west corner of the city walls are put at alternate heights, for overlapping fire. The first <b>documentary</b> <b>record</b> of Canterbury's guns appears in 1403, when {{it is clear that}} there were several kept in the West Gate.|$|E
