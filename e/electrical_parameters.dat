25|$|The {{electrolyte}} must be chemically inert and not chemically {{attack the}} other {{materials in the}} capacitor to ensure long time stable behavior of the capacitor's <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters.</b> The electrolyte's viscosity must be low enough to wet the porous, sponge-like structure of the electrodes. An ideal electrolyte does not exist, forcing a compromise between performance and other requirements.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{permittivity}} {{resulted in}} much higher capacitance values, {{but this was}} coupled with relatively unstable <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters.</b> Therefore, these ceramic capacitors only could replace the commonly used mica capacitors for applications where stability was less important.

25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{may experience}} changes to their <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> due to soldering stress. The {{heat of the}} solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes.

They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications, and for high-frequency applications.|$|E
25|$|Such large {{changes of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> {{specified}} in IEC/EN 62391-2 are usually unacceptable for high current load applications. Components that support high current loads use much smaller limits, e.g., 20% loss of capacitance or double the internal resistance. The narrower definition {{is important for}} such applications, since heat increases linearly with increasing internal resistance and the maximum temperature should not be exceeded. Temperatures higher than specified can destroy the capacitor.|$|E

In a second embodiment, the network is doped with a transition element, such as Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru, Os and/or Au, and change in an <b>electrical</b> <b>parameter</b> value is again analyzed.

The liquid electrolyte provides oxygen for re-forming or self-healing of the dielectric oxide layer. However, it can evaporate through a temperature-dependent drying-out process, which causes <b>electrical</b> <b>parameters</b> to drift, limiting the service life time of the capacitors.|$|E
