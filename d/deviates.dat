40|$|The Reticulitermes flavipes <b>deviate</b> gene was {{investigated}} {{to determine its}} role in termites 2 ̆ 7 response to environmental changes, {{as well as its}} effect on important termite behaviors such as trail following and foraging. ^ The <b>deviate</b> gene was expressed in all four termite body regions that were sampled (antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen), and the gene was also present in the three phenotypes sampled (worker, solder, and nymph). ^ To examine the effect of photoperiod on <b>deviate</b> expression, termites were held in either light, dark, or light/dark cycle conditions. These differences in light conditions resulted in altered <b>deviate</b> expression between light and dark treatments, suggesting a possible connection between the <b>deviate</b> gene and termite circadian rhythm. ^ Temperature did not appear to alter <b>deviate</b> expression across the range tested (17 °C– 27 °C), however when juvenile hormone was added to identical temperature treatments, a difference in gene expression was observed between 17 °C and 22 °C. This information may suggest that the <b>deviate</b> gene is suppressed by juvenile hormone, and that <b>deviate</b> {{may play a role in}} the processes associated with caste maintenance and differentiation in termites. Additionally, when RNA-interference (RNAi) was used to silence <b>deviate</b> gene expression, <b>deviate</b> silenced worker termites held in dishes containing a food source treated with juvenile hormone III did not show significant differences from controls in the number presoldiers that developed or the timing of presoldier development. These findings may further support the hypothesis that <b>deviate</b> expression in termites decreases as juvenile hormone increases. ^ Finally, RNAi gene silencing was used to examine the behavioral role of the <b>deviate</b> gene. First a time-course for the RNAi silencing process was developed using quantitative real-time PCR. It was determined that injections with a short-interfering RNA (siRNA) concentration of 1 ng/ 0. 0036 μl resulted in <b>deviate</b> gene silencing to 53. 6...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Septoplasty for {{correction}} of <b>deviated</b> nose often requires {{removal of the}} <b>deviated</b> part of the quadrangular cartilage and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone or vomer. In most cases, the removed bone is discarded. We de-scribe our experience using septal bone for <b>deviated</b> nose correction, and analyze the postoperative results. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients who underwent {{correction of}} <b>deviated</b> nose using nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage from January 2004 to August 2008. The subjective satisfaction of pa-tients was evaluated 6 to 12 months after rhinoplasty with a questionnaire. Aesthetic outcomes were evaluated by 2 inde-pendent rhinoplastic surgeons who compared preoperative and postoperative photographs. To evaluate outcomes objec-tively, we made anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose before and after surgery using facial photographs. Results: All patients indicated cosmetic satisfaction and improvement in nasal obstruction. The outcome analysis by 2 independent rhinoplastic surgeons indicated that 13 patients had excellent, 5 patients had good, and 5 had fair outcomes. Anthropometric measurements of the <b>deviated</b> nose showed that both the curved <b>deviated</b> angles and the linear <b>deviated</b> angle had improved (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Use of nasal septal bone to straighten <b>deviated</b> septal cartilage appears to be feasible in corrective rhino-plasty, and may be particularly beneficial in cartilage-depleted patients...|$|R

The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E

5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it <b>deviates</b> from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid {{focusing}} on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{corridor}} {{study conducted by}} Main Roads into the long-term needs of the Perth to Darwin National Highway concluded the existing Great Northern Highway, with bypasses around rural towns and the Swan Valley, was the most suitable route for the National Highway. Planning the alignment for the southernmost section, from Reid Highway in Perth to Bindoon, was undertaken from 2003 to 2013.

5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that <b>deviates</b> from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{production}} was tumultuous. Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist {{because of his}} dark skin and typecasting as a villain at the time, but Mahendran refused to direct the film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra (a director himself) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. The film significantly <b>deviates</b> from the novel, with Mahendran having read {{only a part of}} it. Filming lasted for roughly 30 days, and primarily took place in Sringeri. Chettiar was surprised that the finished film had less dialogue than visuals, which he did not expect from Mahendran.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination <b>deviates</b> significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E

5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay <b>deviates</b> from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right <b>deviates</b> from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E

While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway <b>deviates</b> from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E
50|$|The last {{technique}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the seismic anisotropy is related to the sonic logging information of a <b>deviated</b> well.
