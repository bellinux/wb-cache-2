40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{contrast}} to failure approaches at the lamina level or the micromechanics level, the present work concerns failure characterization at the laminate level. Specifically, attention {{is given to}} the ultimate failure characterization for quasi-isotropic laminates.

It is shown that the analytical failure forms decompose into two modes, one for out-of-plane, delamination-type failure and one for in-plane, fiber-controlled-type failure. The work here is mainly given over to the delamination mode of failure. Experimental results are presented for laminates in this mode of failure.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} to the characterisation of the propagation of interlaminar cracks has been through the linear-elastic-fracture-mechanic (LEFM). The mechanical analysis and characterisation of the propagation of interlaminar cracks were mentioned in general. In a number of publications, the fracture behaviour of a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer composite was shown {{to be dominated by}} the properties of the polymer-matrix phase, affecting both the stability of crack propagation and magnitude of the measured fracture toughness. It is shown that for the interlaminar of some polymer/fibre composite the value of the interlaminar fracture energy generally increases as the crack propagates through the composite, i. e. arising 'R-curve' is observed. Thus, it is not usually possible to assign one unique value to the interlaminar fracture energy for any given mode of loading. The performance of the 'R-curve' is various for different mode of loading. In fact, the plastic deformation must more or less occur at the crack tip during crack propagation in polymer/fibre composite, if even thermosetting resin matrix which {{are some of the most}} brittle types of polymer. The common features observed were banding (microshear band) (in thermosetting) and crazing (in thermoplastic). The presence of plastic deformation in process of the interlaminar crack propagation under different mode loading affects the interlaminar failure mechanism pronouncedly. To sum up, the <b>delamination</b> <b>failure</b> mechanisms of the carbon-fibre reinforced composite laminates have two: (1) If interface adhesion between fibre and matrix is weak, the <b>delamination</b> <b>failure</b> mechanism is seem to be interface debonding with accompanied matrix failure, (2) if the interface adhesion between fibre and matrix is good, the <b>delamination</b> <b>failure</b> is commonly matrix failure.

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{is a key}} reliability {{challenge in}} composites and micro-electronic systems due to (high-density) integration of dissimilar materials. Predictive finite element models are used to minimize <b>delamination</b> <b>failures</b> during design, but require accurate interface models to capture (irreversible) crack initiation and propagation behavior observed in experiments. Therefore, an Integrated Global Digital Image Correlation (I-GDIC) strategy is developed for accurate determination of mechanical interface behavior from in-situ delamination experiments. Recently, a novel miniature delamination setup was presented that enables in-situ microscopic characterization of interface delamination while sensitively measuring global load-displacement curves for all mode mixities. Nevertheless, extraction of detailed mechanical interface behavior from measured images is challenging, because deformations are tiny and measurement noise large. Therefore, an advanced I-GDIC methodology is developed which correlates the image patterns by only deforming the images using kinematically-admissible ‘eigenmodes’ that correspond to the few parameters controlling the interface tractions in an analytic description of the crack tip deformation field, thereby greatly enhancing accuracy and robustness.
