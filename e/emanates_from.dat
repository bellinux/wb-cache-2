5|$|Bangui is the {{transport}} {{hub of the}} Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from July to October, some roads are impassable. The road network in the city <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> the Palace de la Republique.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is {{a complex}} structure comprising a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, magnetotail, magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> {{a number of different}} sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> the cloud.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

25|$|A {{corollary}} of {{the rule}} of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a barrister in a court proceeding <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.

25|$|The {{notion of}} Svatantrya {{is central to}} Somananda's philosophy. The free-will of Shiva is {{manifested}} as energy, called Shakti, which <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> Shiva himself and is the stuff from which the world is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, it is beyond any obstacles. When Shakti begins the process of manifestation it subdivides {{into a number of}} ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).|$|E
25|$|The Kabbalistic account {{explains}} {{this difference}} in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> the divine chokhmah (wisdom) realm of Atziluth. However, in order to be perceived it descends to be enclothed in vessels of lower Worlds. Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining his explanation by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.|$|E
25|$|Cells of this {{structure}} are built outwards, from an internal leadership core. Superficially, {{this might be}} likened to a Western cell structure that <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> a headquarters, but the Western centrality is bureaucratic, while structures in other non-western cultures builds on close personal relationships, often built over years, perhaps involving family or other in-group linkages. Such in-groups are thus extremely hard to infiltrate; infiltration has a serious chance only outside the in-group. Still, {{it may be possible}} for an in-group to be compromised through COMINT or, in rare cases, by compromising a member.|$|E

Political theorists from {{the center and the}} right have also found insight in his concepts; his idea of hegemony, for example, has become widely cited. His influence is particularly strong in contemporary political science (see Neo-gramscianism). His work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly popular culture studies in which many have found the potential for political or ideological resistance to dominant government and business interests.|$|E
25|$|SHH <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> the {{notochord}} and ventral {{floor plate}} {{of the developing}} neural tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis.

The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the neural tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral neural tube patterning.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{what is seen}} is not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} that are consistent only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with other gas streams, interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{military}} {{then begins}} a full-scale {{invasion of the}} island, led by Major Strickland. As the U.S. forces continue to the main excavation site, the central mountain on the island begins to fall apart, revealing a huge alien structure inside, which is nearly {{the size of the}} mountain itself. Nomad enters the excavation site at the mountain's base, but is captured by Kyong's men. Kyong deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit, and Nomad watches, helpless, as Kyong shoots one of the hostages in the head and then detonates explosive charges to open the structure. An energy pulse <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> the structure and kills Kyong's men; the pulse also reactivates Nomad's Nanosuit. Kyong, also wearing a Nanosuit, attacks Nomad, but Nomad is able to kill him. As the mountain continues to collapse, a VTOL evacuates the last hostage, Dr. Rosenthal's daughter Helena, but is unable to rescue Nomad.|$|E
25|$|Ganga is a consort to {{all three}} major male deities of Hinduism. As Brahma's partner she always travels {{with him in the}} form of water in his kamandalu (water-pot). She is also Vishnu's consort. She <b>emanates</b> <b>from</b> his foot as Vishnupadi in the avatarana story, and is also, with Lakshmi, his wife. In one popular story, envious of being outdone by each other, the wives begin to quarrel. While Lakshmi {{attempts}} to mediate the quarrel, Ganga and Sarasvati heap misfortune on each other. They curse each other to become rivers, and to carry within them, by washing, the sins of their human worshippers. Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses. He orders Sarasvati to become the wife of Brahma, Ganga to become the wife of Shiva, and Lakshmi, as the blameless conciliator, to remain as his own wife. Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail so loudly, that Vishnu is forced to take back his words. Consequently, in their lives as rivers they are still thought to be with him.|$|E
