40|$|Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a {{cornerstone}} immunosuppressant therapy in solid organ transplantation. MPA is metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase to inactive 7 -O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG). At least three minor metabolites are also formed, including a pharmacologically active acylglucuronide. MPA and MPAG {{are subject to}} enterohepatic recirculation. Biliary excretion of MPA/MPAG involves several transporters, including organic anion transporting polypeptides and multidrug resistant protein- 2 (MRP- 2). MPA metabolites are also excreted via the kidney, {{at least in part}} by MRP- 2. MPA exerts its immunosuppressive effect through the inhibition of inosine- <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> dehydrogenase. Several SNPs have been identified in the genes encoding for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, organic anion transporting polypeptides, MRP- 2 and inosine- <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> dehydrogenase.

While both adenosine <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) and guanosine <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (GMP) form 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes with PtTMPyP 4, the effect on the triplet lifetime is different. With AMP, complexation gives rise to an enhancement of lifetime and quantum yield due to shielding from dissolved oxygen and a slight decrease in the non-radiative decay rate. When complexed with GMP, quenching is observed consistent with photoinduced electron transfer from guanine to triplet-excited PtTMPyP 4, due to both dynamic quenching of the porphyrin and to short-lived emission from 1 : 1 (67 ns) and 1 : 2 (400 ns) complexes. No charge-separated photoproducts are observed by transient UV/vis/near-IR absorption spectroscopy on the nanosecond timescale, suggesting that rapid reverse electron transfer may prevent type 1 DNA damage...|$|R

The rate of inactivation of ATase in vitro is apparently first order {{with respect to}} oxygen concentration and ATase activity. ATase inactivation in vitro (or in vivo) cannot be reactivated {{by a variety of}} reductants. ATase is significantly stabilized to oxygen-dependent inactivation in vitro in the presence of tetrasodium phosphoribosylpyrophosphate and glutamine together. The effects of the end product inhibitors, adenosine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) and guanosine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (GMP), on the stability of ATase are antagonistic. AMP stabilizes ATase, whereas GMP destabilizes the enzyme. The stability of ATase can be manipulated over wide ranges by variations in the AMP/GM ratio. The effects of AMP and GMP on the inactivation of ATase in vitro are very specific. ATase is partially inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, suggesting that the enzyme contains iron (or some other chelatable metal ion).

30|$|Coryne{{bacterium}} glutamicum, a Gram-positive bacterium {{with high}} GC-content {{that belongs to}} the order of Actinomycetales, is a well-known industrial strain for the production of various amino acids and nucleotides, such as lysine, glutamate, and inosine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (IMP) (Eggeling and Bott [2005]). During the fermentation processes, the industrial strains encounter many artificially-driven stresses, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, starvation, and oxidation. These kinds of stressors cause the loss of viability and cellular functions, which lower the productivity of bioprocesses (Li et al. [2009]). Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide are mainly formed during respiration, by the incomplete reduction of oxygen, and because oxidative stress by high oxidizing potential of ROS leads many damages, such as mutations, metabolic pathway disruption, and growth inhibition, oxidative stress is an unavoidable damage for oxygenic bioprocess of aerobic organisms (Fridovich [1998]).|$|R
40|$|AbstractOxidation {{of several}} {{exogenous}} substrates by cultured adult rat ventricular cardiac muscle cells has been assessed. Unlike freshly isolated cardiac muscle cells which oxidize glucose preferentially, the cultured cells more closely resemble metabolically the in situ {{heart and the}} isolated perfused heart, in that their preference for exogenous substrates is {{in the order of}} fatty acid > glucose. This switch in metabolic preference from glucose to fatty acid is complete within 12 h after placing freshly isolated cells in culture. Glucose oxidation is stimulated by insulin and isoproterenol and inhibited by Î²-hydroxybutyrate and octanoate. The adenylate cyclase system has also been examined in these cultured cells. Isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine stimulate the accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3 : <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cyclic AMP) in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of potency is isoproterenol > norepinephrine â epinephrine. This stimulation is potentiated by 1 -isobutyl- 3 -methylxanthine and inhibited by 1 -propranolol...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCystic {{fibrosis}} {{is characterized}} by an impaired cyclic adenosine 3, <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) activated Clâ conductance in parallel with an enhanced amiloride sensitive Na+ conductance (ENaC) of the respiratory epithelium. Very recently, acute downregulation of ENaC by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was demonstrated in several studies. The mechanism, however, by which CFTR exerts its inhibitory effect on ENaC remains obscure. We demonstrate that cytosolic domains of human CFTR are sufficient to induce inhibition of rat epithelial Na+ currents (rENaC) when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and stimulated with 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). Moreover, mutations of CFTR, which occur in cystic fibrosis, abolish CFTR-dependent downregulation of rENaC. Yeast two hybrid analysis of CFTR domains and rENaC subunits suggest direct interaction between the proteins. Enhanced Na+ transport as found in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients is probably {{due to a lack}} of CFTR dependent downregulation of ENaC...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, serine {{is derived}} from the diet and is biosynthe-sized from {{glycolysis}} via 3 -phosphoglycerate. Serine plays a central role in intermediary metabolism as a contributor to phos-pholipid, sphingolipid, and cysteine biosynthesis and as a primary source of glycine (1, 2). There is a tremendous demand for glycine that probably exceeds dietary intake by 10 â 50 -fold, not only for protein synthesisâin particular collagenâbut also as a precursor for 5 major biosynthetic pathways: creatine, porphyrins, purines, bile acids, and glutathione (3). As a consequence of its role in glycine production, serine is also the major donor of folate-linked one-carbon units, which are used in the biosynthesis of purines and 2 -deoxythymidine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Note that for each glycine mole-cule derived from serine there is also a one-carbon unit formed. Therefore, is glycine use equal to the use of one-carbon units? O...|$|R
40|$|Neurotrophins at axonal {{terminals}} {{signal to}} cell bodies to regulate neuronal development via signaling endosomes containing activated Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Requirements {{for the formation}} of signaling endosomes remain, however, poorly characterized. Here we show that a novel Trk-interacting protein, NTRAP (neurotrophic factor receptorâassociated protein), plays a crucial role in this signaling process. NTRAP interacts with the Trk intracellular domain through its C 2 H 2 zinc fingers in a kinase-dependent manner. It is associated with vesicles, some of which contain markers for signaling endosomes. Inhibition of NTRAP function suppresses neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells by altering TrkA endocytic traffic, inhibiting the formation of endosomes containing persistently active MAPKs. In compartmentalized sensory neuron cultures, down-regulation of NTRAP abolishes the ability of neurotrophins applied to distal axons to activate the transcription factor adenosine 3 !, <b>5</b> !<b>-monophosphate</b> response element-binding protein (CREB) and to promote neuronal survival. We propose that NTRAP regulates retrograde neurotrophic signaling by controlling the formation of signaling endosomes...|$|R
