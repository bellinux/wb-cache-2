All IHCA are recorded on a database including : demographic data, medical history, location of IHCA, event time sequence of CPR, initial cardiac rhythm (VF, VT, PEA, Asystole), first treatment attempt, number of EES, type of IV treatment, immediate survival rate (ISR). For Survivors : SAPS II score, duration of ICU stay, treatments and hospital survival rate (HSR) are recorded. Two groups defined by presence (group V) or absence (Group NV) of MV prior to IHCA were compared.|$|E

40|$|Background Clinical {{trials have}} not shown a benefit of {{high doses of}} {{epinephrine}} {{in the management of}} cardiac arrest. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized study comparing repeated high doses of epinephrine with repeated standard doses in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods Adult patients who had cardiac arrest outside the hospital were enrolled if the cardiac rhythm continued to be ventricular fibrillation despite the administration of <b>external</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks,</b> or if they had asystole or pulseless electrical activity at the time epinephrine was administered. We randomly assigned 3327 patients to receive up to 15 high doses (5 mg each) or standard doses (1 mg each) of epinephrine according to the current protocol for advanced cardiac life support. Results In the high- dose group, 40. 4 percent of 1677 patients had a return of spontaneous circulation, as compared with 36. 4 percent of 1650 patients in the standard- dose group (P= 0. 02); 26. 5 percent of the patients in the high-dose group and 23. 6 percent of those in the standard-dose group survived to be admitted to the hospital (P= 0. 05); 2. 3 percent of the patients in the high-dose group and 2. 8 percent in the standard-dose group survived to be discharged from the hospital (P= 0. 34). There {{was no significant difference in}} neurologic status according to treatment among those discharged. High-dose epinephrine improved the rate of successful resuscitation in patients with asystole, but not in those with ventricular fibrillation. Conclusions In our study, long-term survival after cardiac arrest outside the hospital was no better with repeated high doses of epinephrine than with repeated standard doses.

40|$|Fear {{conditioning}} {{associated with}} <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> {{is one of}} the learning and memory in emotion. Such conditioning was usually trained and tested in a Skinner box, in which the <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> was applied on its whole floor. This means that the animal cannot avoid the <b>electrical</b> <b>shock,</b> and then he shows freezing. Here, we developed a fear conditioning task which the <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> is applied on a certain location in an open field. The animal received an <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> when he entered in a quarter of the square open field. The animal can learn easily the place-fear association that a certain dangerous area was avoided in the open field. Rat amygdala was lesioned to study contribution of fear emotion in the conditioned place avoidance. Ibotenic acid lesion of the central or lateral/basolateral nuclei induced revisiting in the shocked arena during conditioning. Avoidance of <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> during conditioning was partially possible even in the lesioned animals. Place-fear memory was impaired by central or lateral/basolateral lesions of the amygdala before and after conditioning. This suggests that the amygdala plays an important role of learning/memory in the place−fear association. 電気ショックと連合した恐怖条件づけは，情動が関係した学習記憶のひとつである。恐怖条件づけは，通常，スキナー箱を用いて訓練されるが，スキナー箱では電気ショックを回避することができず，動物はフリージングを示す。本研究では動物がオープンフィールドの特定の領域に入ったときのみ電気ショックを受ける装置を作製し，場所－恐怖条件づけにおける扁桃体の影響を調べた。その結果，ラットは容易にショック領域を回避する課題を学習できた。扁桃体をイボテン酸により傷害すると，訓練後の試験では，場所－恐怖関連の記憶は，扁桃体を傷害されたラットで有意に減弱された。この結果は，扁桃体が場所－恐怖条件づけの情動記憶学習に関与することを示唆する...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2005 the new {{guidelines}} {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrest were published. The diagnostic criteria of cardiac arrest were simplified and priority is given to thoracic compressions. The ratio of thoracic compressions to insufflations is 30 / 2. The frequency of thoracic compression is 100 /min. In ventricular tachycardia (VT) without pulse or in ventricle fibrillation (VF), defibrillation is attempted with a single external electric shock per cycle. The reanimation cycles are divided in periods of 2 minutes. The two drugs, used to treat VF and VT without pulse, are amiodarone and adrenaline. Adrenaline is not given before the fourth minute into the reanimation and it is administered before the third <b>electrical</b> <b>external</b> <b>shock.</b> In case of asystole or pulse less electrical activity adrenaline is administered as early as possible. Atropine is used in case of pulse less electrical activity with a ventricular response lower than 60 /min. In advanced life support a priority is given to whether or not there are treatable secondary causes (4 H, 4 T), furthermore controlled hypothermia is installed when systemic circulation is restored and optimal support to all vital functions is given.

40|$|Previous studies did {{not provide}} strong {{evidence}} for an increased Parkinson's disease (PD) risk after exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF), but were limited in their scope to address other exposures related {{to the use of}} electricity such as <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks.</b> We evaluated the associations of PD with exposure to ELF-MF, <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> and having worked in "electrical occupations.

No association of PD risk with any of the evaluated exposures related to electricity was observed. We did, however, observe quite consistently reduced risk estimates across the majority of the exposure categories explored. Given the results of the previous studies and the absence of any postulated mechanism, this is unlikely to represent a true protective effect of ELF-MF or <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> on the occurrence of PD.

Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1. 55 (95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 15)), but closer to unity for <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> (HR 1. 17 (95 % CI 0. 83 - 1. 65)). When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1. 56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0. 97.

Lifetime occupational ELF-MF exposure and risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>shocks</b> were assigned to jobs reported in the censuses using job-exposure matrices.

We conducted sensitivity analyses with different assumptions to assess the robustness of our results.
