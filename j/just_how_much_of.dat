Churchill and Grey came to Wilson’s house (4 September) to discuss the situation until after midnight. Wilson (18 September) recorded four separate reports from spies of German troops massing opposite the Belgian frontier. Wilson was also responsible for Military Intelligence, then in its infancy. This included MO5 (under George Macdonogh, succeeding Edmonds) and the embryonic MI5 (under Colonel Vernon Kell) and MI6 (under “C”, Commander Mansfield Cumming). It is unclear from the surviving documents <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Wilson’s time was taken up by these agencies, although he dined with Haldane, Kell and Cumming on 26 November 1911.|$|E

The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E

Several excuse themselves {{and go to the}} warehouse to talk, turning off their microphones in an unsuccessful effort to keep the discussion private. [...] Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) suggests that Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) talk to dismissed crew member Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) to learn more. At Brian's house, Pam tells him that upon seeing the old footage she thinks Jim's feelings for her have largely faded, and Brian agrees. When she asks about what the crew filmed, he tells her that every important moment was captured even when not wearing their microphones. Realizing the extent to which their privacy has been violated, Pam storms out of Brian's house. On re-watching the promo, Pam decides she is glad that the history of her relationship with Jim has been captured.|$|E

There is some disagreement over <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the album is}} actually recorded live – producer Tony Visconti claimed that the only parts that were not overdubbed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, {{saying that he had}} refused Lynott's request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, [...] "It's just not true. The only reason we said that it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... so everything that Visconti claims is bollocks." [...] Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, [...] "I re-did one rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that's it." [...] The album was a huge success, reaching no. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by Classic Rock Magazine in 2004. But this success was overshadowed by the permanent departure of Robertson some time after a gig in Ibiza on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having developed to an impossible level. Robertson soon teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, Wild Horses.|$|E

[...] Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of {{knowledge}} of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. [...] The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum. [...] Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). [...] Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when South Pacific was filmed in 1958, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, [...] "it is difficult to assess <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the final book Josh Logan was responsible for.

The grant—shared by MSU, the University of Montana, the state's seven tribal colleges, the state's six two-year colleges, and its three community colleges—permitted the hiring of 12 tenure-track faculty, provided research support for graduate students, established a math and science mentoring program for Native American students, and created a high school-to-college transition assistance program for Native American students. Another $3.5 million in matching funds was received from the federal Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program.
