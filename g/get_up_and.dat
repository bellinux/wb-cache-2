5|$|He {{had shot}} June in her bed, but {{she managed to}} <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walk a few steps before {{collapsing}} and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill {{was able to get}} downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice into the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was able to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E

5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed very comfortable fighting on their feet in the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E

25|$|In some countries, medical {{personnel}} may be slow {{to respond to}} accidents. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, a pair skater who had been injured in a lift accident lay on the ice for several minutes and had to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave the ice on his own before being offered medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Hypothermia (and also cardiac arrest) {{present a}} risk for {{survivors}} of immersion, as for survivors of exposure; {{in particular the}} risk increases if the survivor, feeling well again, tries to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> move, not realizing their core body temperature is still very low and {{will take a long}} time to recover.|$|E

25|$|Abdul choreographed videos {{for several}} singers {{throughout}} the 1980s, including many videos for Janet Jackson during her Control era. In 1995, Abdul released a dance workout video entitled Paula Abdul's <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Dance! (re-released on DVD in 2003), a fast-paced, hip-hop style workout. In 1998, she released a second video called Cardio Dance (re-released on DVD in 2000). In December 2005, Abdul launched a cheerleading/fitness/dance DVD series called Cardio Cheer, which is marketed {{to children and}} teenage girls involved with cheerleading and dance.|$|E
25|$|After the {{procedure}} is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over {{the procedure}} site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> go about their normal activities. Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics {{can be used to}} ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after {{the procedure is}} completed.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walk around {{a couple of times}} every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic {{marathon}} {{was held}} in the afternoon of a very hot day, and the course provided little or no shade, except for the start and finish. Mihalić kept with the leading group, gradually advancing in the standings, but had a serious setback while approaching the first water station at the 15th kilometer. In a scramble for refreshment he tripped, collided with the water table and fell to the ground, injuring himself. Despite bruising his arms and legs he managed to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> continue the race but only reconnected {{with the head of the}} pack at the 20th kilometer. Shortly after that, Mimoun suddenly broke away from the leading group. Mihalić decided against chasing him until the 35th kilometer, when he realized none of the other runners were able to follow. By that time however Mimoun had an advantage of more than a minute, and Mihalić was unable to catch up with him. In the end, he was the second to cross the finish line in a time of 2:26:32, a minute and a half after Mimoun, and a minute in front of the bronze medalist Veikko Karvonen.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{students}} and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, {{the students}} began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging him to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> go to work. As Mildred tries {{to care for}} her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: {{over the course of several}} decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
