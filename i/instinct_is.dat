Their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> to mask {{pain and}} signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|E

25|$|Basic <b>Instinct</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Ciara. It was {{released}} on December 10, 2010, by LaFace Records and Jive Records. Executive-produced by A agent Mark Pitts, Ciara, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, Basic Instinct returns Ciara to her urban roots with mid-tempo R cuts and bass-heavy pop and dance songs. Aside from production by Stewart and The-Dream, Ciara collaborated with production by Soundz, Infinity and T-Minus. Frequent collaborator and friend Ludacris makes a guest vocal appearance, as does labelmate and fellow Atlanta-native, Usher. After her previous album, Fantasy Ride, suffered numerous leaks and pushbacks, information about Basic Instinct was kept confidential until the first single was released and album was complete.|$|E

25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, {{their job is to}} absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; they respond to experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with her idea of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides the instinct, and elements of nurture depend on whether the <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> expressed.|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E

[...] The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race, and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms. Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.|$|E

50|$|On April 8, 2004, Ubisoft {{announced}} Far Cry Instincts for the Xbox, GameCube and PlayStation 2 systems.

The game uses a similar premise as the original PC version and same game engine, but by comparison, <b>Instincts</b> <b>is</b> less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the PC version's vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts added new multiplayer modes, weapons, dual wielding and feral abilities, which is also added to the storyline. The PlayStation 2 and GameCube ports were later canceled. Far Cry <b>Instincts</b> <b>was</b> exclusive to the Xbox and was released to acclaim in North America on September 27, 2005.|$|R

2500|$|Although Spielrein's {{paper was}} {{published}} in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. In The Ego and the Id (1923) he would develop his argument to state that [...] "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an instinct of destruction directed against the external world". The following year he would spell out more clearly that the [...] "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct {{to a great extent}} outwards [...] The <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power", a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{women are}} not {{explicitly}} condemned for their occupation, and some think that the narrator {{does not intend to}} discredit them for being prostitutes, and their conduct should be judged against universal human standards. On the other hand, Phyllis Bird thinks that the story presupposes the stereotypical biblical image of the prostitute as a selfish liar. The true mother is revealed when her motherly essence - which is also stereotypical - surpasses her selfish essence. Athalya Brenner notes that both women's maternal <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> intact: For the true mother it is manifested, as mentioned, in the compassion and devotion that she shows for her son; And for the impostor it is manifested in her desire for a son, which makes her steal the other mother's son when her own son dies. According to Brenner, one of the lessons of the story is that [...] "true maternal feelings [...] may exist even in the bosom of the lowliest woman".|$|E
2500|$|Freud applied his new {{theoretical}} construct in Civilization and Its Discontents (1930) to {{the difficulties}} inherent in Western civilization—indeed, in civilization and in social {{life as a}} whole. In particular, given that [...] "a portion of the [...] <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] the greatest impediment to civilization". The need to overcome such aggression entailed {{the formation of the}} [...] superego: [...] "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness". [...] The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.|$|E
