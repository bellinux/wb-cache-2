5|$|At the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, Daenerys Targaryen befriends one of {{the younger}} Dosh Khaleen, and when they go outside, they {{encounter}} Jorah and Daario.

5|$|Historically {{the role}} of French rugby coach (or trainer) has varied considerably.

5|$|Since it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to entirely {{eliminate}} pest insects {{from the}} human food chain, insects are inadvertently present in many foods, especially grains. Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock.|$|E

5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> even for experts to identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E

5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something <b>is</b> <b>impossible,</b> we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
