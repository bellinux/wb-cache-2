5|$|Following a <b>fall-out</b> between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's {{contract}} at L'Oranger, {{which saw}} Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L’Oranger with Wareing's former sous chef, Kamel Benamar, {{as the new}} head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open Pétrus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head chef and operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The name came from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with Pétrus being named as a one star restaurant seven months after opening.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} disaster-forced {{biological}} evolution model {{as a general}} framework that includes Darwinian “phylogenic gradualism”, Eldredge-Gould's “punctuated equilibrium”, mass extinctions, and allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation. It describes how reproductive isolation of organisms is established through global disasters due to supernova encounters and local disasters due to radioactive volcanic ash <b>fall-outs</b> by continental alkaline volcanism. Our new evolution model uniquely highlights three major factors of disaster-forced speciation: enhanced mutation rate by higher natural radiation level, smaller population size, and shrunken habitat size (i. e., isolation among the individual populations). We developed a mathematical model describing speciation of a half-isolated group from a parental group, {{taking into account the}} population size (Ne), immigration rate (m), and mutation rate (μ). The model gives a quantitative estimate of the speciation, which is consistent with the observations of speciation speed. For example, the speciation takes at least 105 generations, if mutation rate is less than 10 − 3 per generation per individual. This result is consistent with the previous studies, in which μ is assumed to be 10 − 3 – 10 − 5. On the other hand, the speciation is much faster (less than 105 generations) for the case that μ is as large as 0. 1 in parapatric conditions (m ＜ μ). Even a sympatric (m ～  1) speciation can occur within 103 generations, if mutation rate is very high (μ ～  1 mutation per individual per generation), and if Ne ＜  20 – 30. Such a high mutation rate is possible during global disasters due to supernova encounters and local disasters due to radioactive ash <b>fall-outs.</b> They raise natural radiation level by a factor of 100 – 1000. Such rapid speciation events can also contribute to macro-evolution during mass extinction events, such as observed during the Cambrian explosion of biodiversity. A similar rapid speciation (though in a much smaller scale) also has been undergoing in cichlid fishes and great African apes in the last several tens of thousand years in the current African rift valley, including the origin of humankind due to the radioactive ash <b>fall-outs</b> by continental alkaline volcanism...|$|R

25|$|Various autoantibodies may {{be present}} against thyroid peroxidase, {{thyroglobulin}} and TSH receptors, although {{a small percentage of}} people may have none of these antibodies present. As indicated in various twin studies a percentage of the population may also have these antibodies without developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nevertheless, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic <b>fall-out</b> of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells) in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells) is central to thyrocyte destruction. As is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivities, recruitment of macrophages is another effect of the helper T-lymphocyte activation, with Th1 axis lymphocytes producing inflammatory cytokines within thyroid tissue to further macrophage activation and migration into the thyroid gland for direct effect.|$|E

We propound a futuristic paradigm, founded on symbiosis and utility-oriented ideas, and propose a new architecture/framework for systems of the future. The authors have also made an attempt to address the question of what is to transcend cloud computing and current networking paradigms. Several applications are discussed qualitatively and rudimentary approaches are discussed. Principal theoretic feasibility of one of the proposed hypothesis of cloud communications is established. In this proposed scenario we obtain a linear increase in communication capacity, with minimal energy requirement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
