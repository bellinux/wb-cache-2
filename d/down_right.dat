States one after another submitted with minimal resistance. By March 1557, Bayinnaung in one stroke controlled most of the cis-Salween Shan states from the Patkai range at the Assamese border in the northwest to Mohnyin (Mong Yang), Mogaung (Mong Kawng) in present-day Kachin State to Momeik (Mong Mit), and Thibaw (Hsipaw) in the northeast. But the order broke <b>down</b> <b>right</b> after the army left. The powerful state of Mone (Mong Nai), which sent in tribute in 1556 and thus did not face the invasion, revolted {{with the support of}} Lan Na, which not accidentally was ruled by Mekuti, a brother of Mone's ruler. Mone forces went on to occupy Thibaw, and executed the new saopha appointed by Bayinnaung. In November 1557, five Toungoo armies (33,000 men, 1800 horses, 170 elephants) led by the king himself invaded, and easily occupied Mone and Thibaw.|$|E

His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen.

[...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns."

[...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial. [...] Roosevelt wanted them to be ugly wooden buildings, so that people would want to tear them <b>down</b> <b>right</b> away after World War I. [...] However, to make the buildings more fire resistant, concrete and steel materials were recommended. Roosevelt later expressed regret for allowing these building to be constructed, saying in 1941, [...] "I didn't think I would ever be let into the Gates of Heaven, because I had been responsible for desecrating the parks of Washington." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head.

2500|$|A yorker is a {{difficult}} delivery to bowl as a mistimed delivery can either result in a full toss or half-volley which can easily be played by the batsman. Bowling yorkers is a tactic used most often by fast bowlers. A fast yorker {{is one of the}} most difficult types of delivery in cricket to play successfully, as the bat must be swung <b>down</b> <b>right</b> to the pitch to intercept the ball—if any gap remains between the bat and the pitch, the ball can squeeze through and potentially go on to hit the wicket. The yorker might miss the bat but hit the pads in front of the wicket, resulting in the batsman getting out lbw. When the batsman blocks such a ball, it is referred to as [...] "dug out". A bowler who achieves swing when bowling yorkers can be even more dangerous, as the ball will deviate sideways as it travels towards the batsman, making it even harder to hit.|$|E

[...] The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five, stating, [...] "The game's most compelling aspect is its almost RPG-like popularity engine, which encourages you to see every slight kink in the road as a means to show off. If driving like a hooligan without having to face any consequences – in cars you'll never be able to afford – sounds appealing, then you'll love Forza Horizon.
