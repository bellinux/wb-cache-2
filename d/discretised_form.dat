40|$|Abstract The Convolution and Master {{equations}} {{governing the}} time {{behavior of the}} term structure of Interest Rates are particularly simple for continuous variables. The infinitesimal generator of the generalized Markov process is usually a distribution. We believe that the <b>discretised</b> <b>forms</b> of the equation and of the generator are better suited to compare with actual distributions. They help to avoid the Gaussian-like tail behavior generally derived form the continuous equations with {{a finite number of}} Markov processes. In this paper, the notion of discretised Seed is introduced which naturally leads to an infinite superposition of Markov processes and hence allows a power (rather than exponential) decrease of the empirical probabilities of the variations of the interest rates. The discretised theoretical distributions of probabilities matching the empirical data from the Federal Reserve System (FRS) are deduced from a discretised seed which enjoys remarkable scaling laws. In particular the tails of the distributions are very well reproduced. These results may be used to develop new methods for the computation of the value-at-risk and fixed-income derivative pricing and suggest the appearance of the critical exponents related to models based on self-organized systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for fitting smooth curves {{through a series}} of shapes of landmarks in two dimensions using unrolling and unwrapping procedures in Riemannian manifolds. An explicit method of calculation is given which is analogous to that of Jupp & Kent (1987) for spherical data. The resulting splines are called shape-space smoothing splines. The method resembles that of fitting smoothing splines in real spaces in that, if the smoothing parameter is zero, the resulting curve interpolates the data points, and if it is infinitely large the curve is a geodesic line. The fitted path to the data is defined such that its unrolled version at the tangent space of the starting point is a cubic spline fitted to the unwrapped data with respect to that path. Computation of the fitted path consists of an iterative procedure which converges quickly, and the resulting path is given in a <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> in terms of a piecewise geodesic path.

40|$|A {{previous}} termnumericalnext term algorithm for kinetic modelling of droplet evaporation processes is suggested. This {{algorithm is}} focused on the direct previous numerical solution of the Boltzmann equations for two gas components: vapour and air. The physical and velocity spaces are discretised, and the Boltzmann equations are presented in <b>discretised</b> <b>forms.</b> The solution of these discretised equations is performed in two steps. Firstly, molecular displacements are calculated ignoring the effects of collisions. Secondly, the collisional relaxation is calculated under the assumption of spatial homogeneity. The conventional approach to calculating collisional integrals is replaced by the integration based on random cubature formulae. The distribution of molecular velocities after collisions is found {{based on the assumption that}} the total impulse and energy of colliding molecules are conserved. The directions of molecular impulses after the collisions are random, but the values of these impulses belong to an a priori chosen set. A new method of finding the matching condition for vapour mass fluxes at the outer boundary of the Knudsen layer of evaporating droplets and at the inner boundary of the hydrodynamic region is suggested. The previous numerical algorithm is applied to the analysis of three problems: the relaxation of an initially non-equilibrium distribution function towards the Maxwellian one, the analysis of the mixture of vapour and inert gas confined between two infinite plates and the evaporation of a diesel fuel droplet into a high pressure air. The solution of the second problem showed an agreement between the results predicted by the widely used Bird’s algorithm and the algorithm described in this paper. In the third problem the difference of masses and radii of vapour and air molecules is taken into account. The kinetic effects predicted by the previous numerical algorithm turned out to be noticeable if the contribution of air in the Knudsen layer is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{differential}} diffusion in the numerical modelling of a turbulent non-premixed hydrogen-air jet flame using a Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) method are investigated. The CMC calculations, which are coupled with {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) calculations, relax the commonly used assumption of equal species mass diffusivities. The {{focus is on the}} predictions of species mass fractions and temperatures, especially the production of NO. The results of the calculations are compared with available experimental measurements. The formulation of the CMC species transport equation including differential diffusion is presented and the closure of the terms are discussed. Further, the CMC equation for conditional enthalpy is also derived in the present study. The implementation of the CMC equations using two dimensional finite volume method is discussed, including a presentation of the <b>discretised</b> <b>forms</b> of the equations. The results of the CMC calculations including the effects of differential diffusion show that NO mass fractions are increased from the large underpredictions observed for equal diffusivity results near the jet nozzle. Improvements are also found for other species such as H 2 and H 2 O. The results show physical behaviours, such as a shift in the location of the reaction zone and increased reaction rates due to increased diffusion rates of H 2. It is also found that differential diffusion effects persist downstream from the nozzle, where the effects are expected to be small, and reasons for the discrepancies are discussed in the present study. The profiles obtained from the CMC calculations show large radial variations, much larger than in equal diffusivity calculations. An analysis isolating the differential diffusion effects of various species shows that the largest changes occur due to the accounting for the differential diffusivity of H 2. A budget of the terms in the CMC equations for the differentially diffusing chemical species and enthalpy is also investigated...|$|R

Recent {{progress has been made}} in obtaining data-rich results, using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models within smaller river reaches, but the application of CFD to large rivers has not been fully developed due to our inability to: i) design numerically-stable meshes for complex topographies, and ii) collect high resolution data appropriate for model boundary conditions. Here, we test a new five-term mass-flux scaling algorithm to include bed topography over large spatial scales, where the <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of the mass and momentum equations are modified using a mass-flux scalling approach.

40|$|A user-oriented {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} hydrocyclone classifier is described. The model uses state-of-the-art numerical techniques to solve the <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of the Navier-Stokes equations relating to pulp velocities, and the transport equations for air and particle concentrations. Turbulence closure is affected by employing a turbulence model which takes into direct account the effects of swirl {{and the presence of}} particles. An algebraic slip approach is used to model the relative movement of particles in the cyclone and also the formation of the air-core. The calculation produces point-by-point values of the three pulp velocity components, the pressure, the mass fraction of particles and the mass fraction of air which eventually forms the air core. The model is general in its formulation and not subject to geometrical or operational constraints. It is here validated by comparison to the well known Kelsall (1952) experiment. The predicted velocity profiles agree well with experiment, and flow rate (pressure drop), flow split, cut point and efficiency curve compare well with a number of empirical formulae. The particle profiles show not only a build-up at the cyclone conical surface but also the existence of an equilibrium radius for each particle size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{two phase flow}} investigation, {{there is}} a need for robust methods capable of {{predicting}} interfaces, in addition to treating the traditional governing equations of fluid mechanics (Navier-Stokes Eqs.). Such methods in a finite volume approach can be classified into two typical categories called interface tracking and interface capturing methods. According to their abilities, interface capturing methods are of more interest in free surface modeling, especially when complex interface topologies such as wave breaking are included. These methods solve a scalar transport equation in order to find the distribution of two phases all over the computational domain. That is, all properties of the effective fluid will be calculated. In this paper, some existing schemes will be reviewed and two high order composite schemes will be applied on a <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of the volume fraction convection equation. A discussion on the performance of methods will be presented as a result of different scalar distribution convection in various velocity fields according to the program that has been developed in this manner.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a frequency-domain computational aeroacoustics tool for predicting aft noise radiation through turbofan ducts and jets and {{its application to}} two realistic engine exhaust configurations which have been experimentally tested. The tool {{is based on the}} <b>discretised</b> axisymmetric <b>form</b> of the linearised Euler equations in conjunction with perfectly matched layer equations at the inlet and far-field boundaries using high-order finite differences. The resultant linear system of equations is inverted by the state-of-the-art parallel sparse solver MUMPS. The far-field prediction is carried out by integrating Kirchhoff's formula in frequency domain. The code has already been verified extensively for idealized semi-infinite duct cases with comparisons to available analytical solutions with very good agreement. Therefore, we concentrate in this paper on numerical solutions to the experimental cases tested in the EC FP 6 Project TURNEX (TUrbomachinery noise Radiated through the engine EXhaust) to assess and partially validate the present solver further. Comparisons of the computed results with the measured data reveal that the solver predicts the general noise radiation patterns and sound levels reasonably well, so long as the target in-duct azimuthal mode remains dominant as it radiates to the far-field. The agreement strongly suggests that, at least for the range of mean flows and acoustic conditions considered, the physical aeroacoustic radiation processes are fully captured through the frequency-domain solutions to the linearised Euler equations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn modern {{computer}} systems, the intermittent behaviour of infrequent, additional loads affects performance. Often, representative {{traces of}} storage disks or remote servers can be scarce and obtaining real data is sometimes expensive. Therefore, stochastic models, through simulation and profiling, provide cheaper, effective solutions, where input model parameters are obtained. A typical {{example is the}} Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which can have its time index <b>discretised</b> to <b>form</b> a hidden Markov model (HMM). These models {{have been successful in}} capturing bursty behaviour and cyclic patterns of I/O operations and Internet traffic, using underlying properties of the discrete (or continuous) Markov chain. However, learning on such models can be cumbersome in terms of complexity through re-training on data sets. Thus, we provide an online learning HMM (OnlineHMM), which is composed of two existing variations of HMMs: first, a sliding HMM using a moving average technique to update its parameters “on-the-fly” and, secondly, a multi-input HMM capable of training on multiple discrete traces simultaneously. The OnlineHMM reduces data processing times significantly and thence synthetic workloads become computationally more cost effective. We measure the accuracy of reproducing representative traces through comparisons of moments and autocorrelation on original data points and HMM-generated synthetic traces. We present, analytically, the training steps saved through the OnlineHMM's adapted Baum-Welch algorithm and obtain, through simulation, mean waiting times of a queueing model. Finally, we conclude our work and offer model extensions for the future...|$|R
40|$|For many {{industries}} {{the propagation}} of sound in complex flows is a critical issue. Most Computational Aero Acoustics propagation methods currently in use in industry {{are based on the}} full potential theory which cannot properly describe sound propagation through complex sheared flows. When dealing with turbomachinery noise radiated from the engine exhaust, a strong refraction occurs through the jet shear layer. To better represent the physics at hand one can solve instead the Linearised Euler Equations (LEE). However, time-domain LEE models have shortcomings for industrial applications, such as the presence of linear instabilities and the stability of impedance models. Most of these issues can be avoided by solving the LEE in the frequency domain. Nevertheless, this can be very demanding because of the high memory requirements associated with solving large sparse linear systems. For high frequency, the standard finite element method (FEM) is known to suffer from large dispersion errors. Its straightforward application to the LEE, which involve up to five unknowns in 3 D, would be computationally costly. To address these issues, an alternative approach based on high-order FEM is presented in this paper. A <b>discretised</b> axisymmetric <b>form</b> of the LEE is described in conjunction with Perfectly Matched Layers. In addition, a numerical stabilisation scheme of type Galerkin/Least-Squares is included in the numerical model.

The sound propagation and radiation are accurately described, as well as the interaction between the acoustic waves and the hydrodynamic field resulting in the vorticity shedding from the duct lip...|$|R
40|$|Granular flow is broadly {{classified}} into two distinct regimes. The first is rapid granular flow where particle collisions {{are assumed to}} be instantaneous and the second is dense granular flow where particles move together and slide on each other. Many contributions on the modelling of granular flow and the solving of such models numerically, restrict themselves to one of these distinct regimes. In some applications this is not possible. Because many features of granular media can be reproduced by a system of smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions, it is tempting to extend the hydrodynamic modelling often used for rapid granular flow to the dense regime by means of algebraic relations. We present here a kinetic modelling approach inheriting a dynamic Coulomb friction for the dilute regime extended by a smooth transition to a full Coulomb friction for dense granular flow. The system of hydrodynamic equations together with strongly nonlinear, diverging algebraic rel ations for the system quantities pose, in <b>discretised</b> <b>form,</b> a challenging numerical problem.

A method able to simulate the dynamic transient rolling and slipping operating conditions is developed, although the small displacement assumption of the modal approach is dropped. The method, which is based on the combined modal-time and space-time domain solutions, is applied on the study of the physical mechanism of the launch process.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the vibrational characteristics of wide band bandsaws. Firstly, the vibration of bandsaw structures was considered. A computer program was developed to predict the natural frequencies and mode shapes of three dimensional structures, consisting of beams, springs, viscous dampers, concentrated masses, and gyroscopic rotors. The method used was the dynamic stiffness method. Some of the vibrational characteristics of the bandsaw structure were then established from experimental results and results obtained from the computer program. The gyroscopic effects on the bandsaw structure due to rotating pulleys were also examined. Secondly, the dynamic stiffness method was used to solve the moving beam problem. The moving beam had been used previously to model the bandsaw blade. The dynamic stiffness method allowed complex problems to be analysed in a systematic manner. A moving beam proved to be too crude a representation of a wide bandsaw blade at the level of detail being investigated. Therefore, attempts were made to model the dynamic behaviour of wide bandsaw blades with moving plates. A general approach to the solution of the moving plate problem is presented in this thesis, it uses the extended Galerkin method to discretise the partial differential equation of motion and the boundary conditions into a quadratic eigenvalue problem. The solutions for this problem were obtained by using a linearisation technique. The effects of in-plane stresses on bandsaw blades are considered in this thesis. Three cases are examined; a linearly distributed stress across the width of the blade due to wheel-tilting and/or backcrowning, a parabolic distributed stress across the width of the blade due to prestressing, and stresses induced by tangential cutting forces. Parametric instabilities due to fluctuating tension, and due to periodic tangential cutting forces were investigated. The harmonic balance method was used on the <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of the moving plate equation to obtain the required instability regions. Finally, the dynamic instability of a moving plate due to a nonconservative component of the tangential cutting force was considered.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{examined}} the <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of Boltzmann-like transport, i. e. the neutron trans- port equation and the Boltzmann-Fokker-Plank (BFP) equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method and polynomial basis functions. In particular we examined an adaptive algorithm, which bases its decision of where to refine on the adjoint problem, as in sensitivity analysis. In this way an accurate detector response should be obtained in an efficient manner. The goal-orietend criterion uses the adjoint solution as a measure for importance to the detector response. This refinement technique is compared to traditional methods, which base refinement on {{the change in the}} solution of a local test refinement, and to the discrete ordinates method. Problems with one spatial and one angular dimension are used to test the adaptive algorithm. In previous work the same problems were solved with first order polynomials in the spatial di- rection and zeroth order polynomials in the angular direction. We saw then that constant patches, zeroth order polynomials in the angular part of the domain, could not represent the angular flux in diffusive materials accurately. We furthermore saw that the quality of the error estimate with the global adjoint approximation was reasonable, while with the local adjoint approximation it was poor. In this work we employed first order polynomials in both the spatial and angular domains. Linear patches, the first order polynomials in the angular domain, provide a better approximation of the angular flux using less unknowns. This can be seen when comparing both the constant and linear patches to the discrete ordinates method. Also the diffusive materials are now much easier to approximate, which has as effect that traditional refinement gives smaller errors than with constant patches. The quality of the error estimate with linear patches, however, is poor for almost every test case. A cause {{can be found in the}} approximation of the exact adjoint solution that is used in the estimate. This approximation is done by refining all the current mesh uniformly one level. It appears the space of the deeper level is only slightly larger than the coarser level on which the forward problem is solved, in the sense that the adjoint solution on that deeper level does not yield information not contained in the coarser level. The solution we propose is to solve the adjoint problem with higher order basis functions than those of the forward problem. Finally we present some results on the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation discretised with discontinuous Galerkin. The discrete operator one obtains is very similar to the discrete transport operator, with extra bands added within a spatial element. To solve this system of equations one could use a Gauss-Seidel iteration, which means one sometimes uses outdated angular flux values of neighbours, or Kylov subspace methods, as the matrix operator is not computed explicitly.

However, the opportunities to witness one another, already tenuous in physical presence, do not smoothly transition into the new generation of technology-mediated interactions, be it person-to-person or person-to-system. It is only through the act of witnessing one another that people establish presence and develop trust, in ever-expanding merging biological, social and algorithmic realities. As a technological medium acting at the very boundary of the individual in both the physical and digital world, {{it would be interesting to}} design wearables that enhance witnessing in modern network(ed) societies. This work approaches the effort simultaneously from Policy Analysis, sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives. Key references include Marshall McLuhan (Medium Theory), Barry Wellman (Networked Individualism) and Caroline Nevejan (Witnessed Presence). This is coupled with a case-study of an upcoming wearable called BOND by Kwamecorp, a new media agency. BOND utilises the touch modality that wearables uniquely can harness, to send tickles between a pair of synced devices. The product is targeted at intimate couples. As such, both the wearable form-factor as well as the novel communication channel make BOND ideal for investigating witnessed presence in wearables. It was found that wearables in their mobility and portability can be imagined as technological organs on the modern human being. A useful design mantra for wearables was condensed as contextual embodied augmentation. Context-sensitivity demands specialised affordances; embodiment refers to intuitive extensions and calls to action that keep users immersed in the real world, as opposed to the reality-in-a-screen; and finally augmentation is recommended as a design principle such that wearables provide ways the enrich reality with information. Touch-modality is seen as a promising new avenue unique to wearables; digital stimuli can be ‘affective’ on users. Wearables in their selective and portable enhancement divorce traditionally conflated social function and physical place, condensing expertise into portable devices. In bridging the digital-physical world, wearables become the offline equivalent of digital ‘avatars’, which gain value by storing valuable personal information and furthermore using them to provide pointed affordances for (inter) actions in both online and offline worlds. An ethnographic study of Kwamecorp and a design history of BOND contributes an insider look at new technology development in a contemporary startup setting. Interviews conducted with nine designers from Kwamecorp are analysed to elucidate the design intentions of BOND. BOND’s Touch module is confirmed to facilitate witnessed presence by enhancing co-presence among interacting parties. This is enabled by a ‘quantum of presence’ interaction. This <b>discretised</b> <b>form</b> of connectivity is in line with a general trend of affordances to counterbalance the greater frequency of connection and communication in modern living. These kinds of communications, in their reduced format, are both easily deployable in wearables and, while the reduction in complexity can be ambiguous, it is a feature that invites more creative participation from both parties. Ultimately, the thesis is useful to anyone interested in developing both industrial and consumer applications with wearable electronics, those interested in how sociological insights can help actively in the design of new technologies for socio-technical systems, or as a primer for witnessed presenceEngineering and Policy AnalysisMulti Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
