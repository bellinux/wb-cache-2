SEAM was invited to improve the prototype by lengthening the <b>hull,</b> <b>fitting</b> a more supple suspension, and moving the fire-proof bulkhead 95 mm to the back to enlarge the fighting compartment, creating more room to operate the 75 mm gun.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spinnaker}} {{is often}} called a kite, or a chute (as in cruising chute) because it somewhat resembles a parachute in both construction and appearance. This {{should not be confused}} with the spinnaker chute which is a <b>hull</b> <b>fitting</b> sometimes used for launching and recovering the spinnaker. A purported etymology has the first boat to carry this sail being a Cowes yacht named Sphinx, from which [...] "Sphinx's Acre" [...] and eventually [...] "Spinnaker".|$|E
40|$|Reasoning from {{information}} extraction given by point cloud data mining allows contextual adaptation and fast decision making. However, {{to achieve this}} perceptive level, a point cloud must be semantically rich, retaining relevant information for the end user. This paper presents an automatic knowledge-based method for pre-processing multi-sensory data and classifying a hybrid point cloud from both terrestrial laser scanning and dense image matching. Using 18 features including sensor’s biased data, each tessera in the high-density point cloud from the 3 D captured complex mosaics of Germigny-des-prés (France) is segmented via a colour multi-scale abstraction-based featuring extracting connectivity. A 2 D surface and outline polygon of each tessera is generated by a RANSAC plane extraction and convex <b>hull</b> <b>fitting.</b> Knowledge is then used to classify every tesserae based on their size, surface, shape, material properties and their neighbour’s class. The detection and semantic enrichment method shows promising results of 94 % correct semantization, {{a first step toward}} the creation of an archaeological smart point cloud...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{hull form}} module {{is the main}} module in ship design. The problem of {{creating}} fair ship hull surface is of major importance in Computer Aided Ship Design environment. The fitness of these surfaces is generally considered a subjective notion depending on {{the judgment of the}} designers (eg. visually pleasing, devoid of unnecessary bumps or wiggles, satisfying certain continuity requirements). One of the restriction in ship hull design is that the existing details of a ship design on paper or a ship that already been constructed physically couldn’t be reconstructed accurately and concisely in a ship hull design software. This problem can take on many different characteristics, depending on the goal of the reconstruction, the origin of the offset, and tools or methods available to tackle the job. All of these {{must be taken into account}} in developing the best approach to solving the problem in the most efficient manner. In the field of surface modeling of hull form, geometric complexity of hull form gives many difficulties. This leads to the issue of what is the best surface reconstruction method for ship hull? This research strives to solve this problem by creating fair ship hull surface using NURBS. An optimized ship <b>hull</b> <b>fitting</b> approach using NURBS is developed. Evaluation and analysis (percentage of accuracy, fairness and speed of processing) on the proposed approach and also comparison of proposed approach and other systems/softwares will be done...|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} put in dry dock {{for the first time}} at Lyttelton and the carpenter, Frederick Dailey, {{prepared}} a lengthy report detailing the numerous empty bolt holes and slack <b>hull</b> <b>fittings</b> he found. Six feet (1.8 metres) of water had seeped into the ship's bilges and lower hold through badly-sealed joints in the planking.

A staggered refit was also announced, which will involve cutting into the ships' <b>hulls</b> and <b>fitting</b> additional diesel generation capacity. The reliability issues have on occasion resulted in near-complete power generation failures, temporarily disabling not only propulsion, but power generation for weapons, navigational systems, and other purposes, leaving the ships vulnerable to [...] "total electric failure".|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} space must {{be large enough}} for a fully kitted diver and bellman to sit, and for their umbilicals to be stowed neatly on racks, and the hatch to be opened inwards while they are inside. Anything bigger will make the bell heavier than it really needs to be, so all equipment that {{does not need to}} be inside is mounted outside. This includes a framework to support the ancillary equipment and protect the bell from impact and snagging on obstacles,and the emergency gas supply, which is usually racked around the framework and connected via manifolds to the internal gas panel. The part of the framework that keeps the lower hatch off the bottom is called the bell stage. It may be removable. The bell umbilical is connected to the bell via through <b>hull</b> <b>fittings</b> (<b>hull</b> penetrations), which must withstand all operating pressures without leaking. The internal gas panel connects to the hull penetrations and the diver's umbilicals. The umbilicals will carry main breathing gas supply, a communications cable, a pneumofathometer hose, hot water supply for suit heating, power for helmet mounted lights, and possibly gas reclaim hose and video cable. The bell umbilical will usually also carry a power cable for internal and external bell lighting. Hydraulic power lines for tools do not have to pass into the interior of the bell as they will never be used there, and tools can also be stored outside. There may be an emergency through-water communications system with a battery power supply, and a location transponder working on the international standard 37.5 kHz. The bell may also have viewports and a medical lock.|$|R

This nonetheless represented the single richest capture from any naval action during the Seven Years' War. The captains of Active and Favourite each received £64,872 as prize money – a sum worth approximately £ at 2015 prices. Ordinary seamen on both ships received £480 each, equivalent to 33 years' wages. One of the crew purchased a gold watch and then melted it in a frying pan for the amusement of his crew mates.|$|R

5000|$|Johnson Boat Works {{had built}} mostly scow designs on White Bear Lake, Minnesota since its {{founding}} in 1896.

Melges Boat Works took control of most scow molds, while Catalina Yachts bought the Johnson 18 molds as well as several un-finished Johnson 18 <b>hulls</b> and <b>fittings.</b> Very few Johnson 18's were produced after the sale and Catalina Yachts retains control of the class molds.|$|R
50|$|Some {{concern has}} been raised {{with regard to the}} use of {{aluminium}} alloys almost exclusively in the construction of Sea Fighter’s hull, as well as future vessels based on the design.

Additionally galvanic corrosion may result between the aluminum <b>hull</b> and steel <b>fittings,</b> as happened to the littoral combat ship USS Independence.|$|R
