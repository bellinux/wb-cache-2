40|$|<b>Discharging</b> <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> from {{a nozzle}} at {{sufficient}} large velocity {{leads to a}} continuous jet that due to capillary forces breaks up into droplets. Here we investigate the formation of microdroplets from the breakup of micron-sized jets with ultra high-speed imaging. The diminutive size of the jet implies a fast breakup time scale τ_c = √(ρ r^ 3 / γ) {{of the order of}} 100 ns, and requires imaging at 14 million frames per second. We directly compare these experiments with a numerical lubrication approximation model that incorporates inertia, surface tension, and viscosity [Eggers and Dupont, J. Fluid Mech. 262, 205 (1994); Shi, Brenner, and Nagel, Science 265, 219 (1994) ]. The lubrication model allows to efficiently explore the parameter space to investigate the effect of jet velocity and liquid viscosity on the formation of satellite droplets. In the phase diagram we identify regions where the formation of satellite droplets is suppressed. We compare the shape of the droplet at pinch-off between the lubrication approximation model and a boundary integral (BI) calculation, showing deviations at the final moment of the pinch-off. Inspite of this discrepancy, the results on pinch-off times and droplet and satellite droplet velocity obtained from the lubrication approximation agree with the high-speed imaging results...|$|E

30|$|The {{emission}} spectrum [30 – 32] {{has shown that}} the main contributions to the {{emission spectrum}} of the water vapor plasma are OH, atomic hydrogen, and the oxygen radical. In the case of the bubble mode, when the streamers fill the entire bubble, a significant emission from the nitrogen second positive system and the nitrogen ion (first negative system). The discharge operates in two different modes. For small conductivities of the <b>liquid,</b> the <b>discharge</b> is <b>a</b> direct <b>liquid</b> streamer <b>discharge</b> (liquid mode). This mode is similar to the typical so-called corona discharges in water. For conductivities above typically 45  μS cm− 1 a large vapor bubble is formed. In the bubble mode, the streamers are located at the bubble–liquid interface. The hydrogen peroxide formation efficiency is dependent on power with a maximum for intermediate powers. The hydrogen peroxide formation efficiency is significantly smaller in the bubble mode than in the liquid mode. In the work [33], the kinetic parameters of electrons for the dielectric barrier <b>discharge</b> with <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> electrode at atmospheric pressure have been estimated. Thus, we may suppose that the CNP will possess chemical activity with respect to its application in realization of the different oxidative-reductive processes.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problems related to measuring and analyzing the characteristics of partial discharges which are the main instrument for oil-filled high-voltage electrical equipment diagnosing. The experiments on recording of partial discharges in transformer oil {{have been carried out}} in the “point-plane” electrode system at alternating current. The instantaneous voltage and the apparent charge have been measured depending on the root-mean-square voltage and the phase angle of partial discharges. This paper aimes at carrying out a statistical analysis of the obtained experimental results, in particular, the construction of a parametric probabilistic model of the dependence of the partial discharge inception voltage distribution on the value of the root-mean-square voltage. It differs from usual discharges which occur in liquid dielectric materials in case of sharp inhomogeneous electrode system. It has been suggested that <b>discharges</b> of <b>a</b> different type are the discharges in gas bubbles that occur when partial <b>discharges</b> in <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> emerge. This assumption is confirmed {{by the fact that the}} number of such discharges increases with increasing the root-mean-square voltage value. It is the main novelty of this paper. This corresponds to the nature of the occurrence of such discharges. After rejecting the observations corresponding to discharges in gas bubbles, a parametric probabilistic model has been constructed. The model obtained makes it possible to determine the probability of partial <b>discharge</b> occurrence in <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> at <b>a</b> given value of the instantaneous voltage depending on the root-mean-square voltage...|$|R
50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the <b>discharge.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>liquid</b> flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the <b>liquid</b> into <b>a</b> vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.|$|R

40|$|The {{observation}} of light at deep sea hydrothermal vents at wavelengths in the visible from 450 nm to 650 nm [1] {{can not be}} explained as thermal radiation at the observed temperatures (~ 350 °). The physical processes that have been considered as possible explanations include sonoluminescence. Sonoluminescence (SL) is a phenomenon in which light is emitted when <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> is cavitated in some manner. [2, 3] In laboratory studies the cavitation is usually excited by ultrasonic sources of 20 KHz to MHz, and the light results from the implosion of bubbles of radius less than 100 /im.

The improved confinement derives from {{a reduction of}} electron thermal conductivity (chi(e)) as density increases, while ion thermal conductivity (chi(i)) remains close to neoclassical values. Linear microstability reveals the importance of lithium in triggering a turbulent inward flux for electrons and deuterium by changing the growth rates and phase of the ion-driven turbulence, while lithium flux is always directed outwards. A particle diffusion coefficient, D similar to 0. 07 m(2) s(- 1), and an inward pinch velocity, V similar to 0. 27 ms(- 1), in qualitative agreement with Bohm-gyro-Bohm predictions are inferred in pellet fuelled lithized discharges. Radio frequency heated plasmas benefit from cleaner plasmas with edge optimized conditions. Lower hybrid waves penetration and current drive effects are clearly demonstrated at and above ITER densities thanks to a good control of edge parameters obtained by plasma operations with the external poloidal limiter, lithized walls and pellet fuelling. The electron cyclotron (EC) heating system is extensively exploited in FTU for contributing to ITER-relevant issues such as MHD control: sawtooth crash is actively controlled and density limit disruptions are avoided by central and off-axis deposition of 0. 3 MW of EC power at 140 GHz. Fourier analysis shows that the density drop and the temperature rise, stimulated by modulated EC power in low collisionality plasmas are synchronous, implying that the heating method is the common cause of both the electron heating and the density drop. Perpendicularly injected electron cyclotron resonance heating is demonstrated to be more efficient than the obliquely injected one, reducing the minimum electric field required at breakdown {{by a factor of}} 3. Theoretical activity further develops the model to interpret high-frequency fishbones on FTU and other experiments as well as to characterize beta-induced Alfven eigenmodes induced by magnetic islands in ohmic discharges.
