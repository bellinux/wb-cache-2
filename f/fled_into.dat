5|$|After an {{individual}} ascends the throne, {{he or she}} reigns until death. The only voluntary abdication, that of Edward VIII, had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament, His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was James VII and II, who <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution.|$|E

5|$|AQI {{launched}} {{a series of}} attacks in Jordan in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar. The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the Trebil checkpoint along the Jordanian border with Anbar Province in December 2004. In August, two US warships in Aqaba, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> Iraq. On 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide bombings in Amman, killing 60. A fourth bomber, also from Anbar, was caught.|$|E
5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|In December 1963, Zanzibar {{was granted}} {{independence}} by the United Kingdom {{and became a}} constitutional monarchy under the Sultan. Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was overthrown a month later during the Zanzibar Revolution. Jamshid <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile, and the Sultanate {{was replaced by the}} People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba. In April 1964, the republic was united with Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which became known as Tanzania six months later.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia {{at the head of}} a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus. Thoros <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 29/30 September 1962, {{military}} commanders in South Kasai, led by Kankolongo, led a coup d'état in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. The coup d'état was followed by calls for South Kasai to be fully re-integrated into the Congo. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking {{the end of the}} secession. Kalonji himself escaped capture during the coup and <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile in Barcelona in Francisco Franco's Spain. General Dinanga also fled.|$|E
5|$|The few Turks {{who survived}} the {{massacre}} <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the mountains, where the majority {{were killed by the}} local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their troops, with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result was}} dramatic. An {{estimated}} 500,000 Rwandans <b>fled</b> east <b>into</b> Tanzania {{in the month}} of April. On 2829 April, 250,000 people crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania in 24 hours in what the UNHCR agency called [...] "the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times". The apparent organization of this Rusumo evacuation is seen as evidence that the collapsing government was behind the large refugee outflows. By May 1994, a further 200,000 people from the provinces of Butare, Kibungo and Kigali-Rural had <b>fled</b> south <b>into</b> Burundi.|$|R
5|$|When the French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.|$|E
5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E
5|$|All six LSTs were {{unloaded}} by 11:45. There {{was little}} opposition. Eleven Japanese {{soldiers were killed}} by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the interior. American casualties {{on the day of the}} landing came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, but most were small.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, {{the number}} of Amin's {{supporters}} and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed {{as a result of}} the years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile. In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General Mustafa Adrisi, was injured in a car crash, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of Tanzanian territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E
5|$|Discharging {{most of the}} {{remaining}} escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president. Between Washington and Woodstock, the party was overtaken by Union forces under Lieutenant Colonel Andrew K. Campbell; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and Clifton, James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the nearby woods. At Sandersville, he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he {{and the rest of his}} companions would proceed to Madison, Florida. On May 11, they reached Milltown, Georgia, where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.|$|E
5|$|During Warwick's exile, King Edward {{stripped}} Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, {{making him}} Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville {{appears to have}} seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained {{about the lack of}} landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a 'pie's nest'. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile in Burgundy.|$|E

25|$|In April one of Yacef's collaborators, Djamila Bouhired {{was arrested}} by a French patrol, Yacef {{following}} her and disguised as a woman attempted to shoot her, but only succeeded in wounding her and Yacef <b>fled</b> back <b>into</b> the Casbah.|$|R
5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories to the east and south of the Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Blökkumen ("Romanians") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians"). Some of the Pechenegs <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, Duyệt {{became a}} eunuch of the 18-year-old Prince Nguyễn Ánh, {{the nephew of}} the slain Nguyễn Lord and the most {{senior member of the}} family who survived the revolt by the three Tây Sơn brothers, who seized {{southern}} Vietnam from the Nguyễn in 1777. As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> the dense jungles of the Mekong Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards. From 1777 onwards, the military balance between the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E
