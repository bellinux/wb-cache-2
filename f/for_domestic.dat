5|$|In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes {{revisited}} the Jevons paradox for {{the case}} of society's energy use.

Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> and irrigation purposes.|$|E

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process {{accelerated}} as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E
