5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E

5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average {{length of the}} femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the female.|$|E

30|$|We first analyze {{correlation}} coefficients of the EX magnitude–frequency distributions on the double-logarithmic and semilogarithmic graphs (Figs.  2, 3, 4, 5). The {{correlation coefficients}} show high values {{of more than}} about 0.9 in both types of graph {{for all of the}} EXs. This suggests that both relationships explain the observed data well. However, it is clear that correlation coefficients for the semilogarithmic graphs <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the double-logarithmic ones for all of EXs except Suwanosejima. All of the semilogarithmic graph coefficients <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> 0.89, and most <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> 0.97.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter (5.2AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 {{times the}} mass {{of all the other}} planets put together. It is {{composed}} largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 69 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Mercury.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Akodon boliviensis group, {{including}} A.caenosus, {{are generally}} similar {{and difficult to}} separate, but they differ in relative cranial measurements and some other characters. A.spegazzinii <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less well-developed eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well-developed ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears.|$|E
50|$|Like its {{relative}} the banksia bee (Hylaeus alcyoneus), H. sanguinipictus displays sexual dimorphism—the males {{of the species}} <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the females; in most other types of bee, females <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> males. The males perch and defend Banksia inflorescences while waiting to mate with females, and combat other males.|$|R

5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} otter <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left.

The mean tracheal length of the river otter is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E
