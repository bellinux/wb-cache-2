40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the concept of}} optical transport network based on high altitude platforms (HAPs) flying in lower stratosphere and equipped with optical communications payload. The stratospheric transport network is formed of optical links between HAPs and optical backhaul uplinks and downlinks between HAPs and ground stations (GSs) hosting gateways to the backbone network. In order to consider limitations of free space optics (FSO) for the dimensioning of stratospheric optical transport network (OTN), we investigate the physical layer aspects for a DWDM based optical interplatform link (IPL). Taking into account the physical constraints imposed by FSO, we estimate the number of wavelengths required for <b>full</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> without wavelength conversions. We are using an analytical approach for bus and full mesh regular topologies, and a numerical approach for circumcircled star, ring and star regular topologies. We also evaluate {{the performance of a}} representative network with irregular topology using different routing and wavelength assignment algorithms. We show that the number of wavelengths needed to achieve <b>full</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> strongly depends on the physical topology of the network, and that adaptive routing yields better overall performance of the network compared to fixed and fixed alternate routing. The analysis also shows that resources in realistic network topologies tend to be used very inefficiently, which could be improved by traffic engineering solutions or wavelength conversions...|$|E
40|$|A medium {{access control}} (MAC) {{strategy}} that accounts for the limited tunability of present-day lasers and filters and yet supports a large total number of wavelengths in the network is proposed. <b>Full</b> <b>interconnectivity,</b> contention-free access and a high value of concurrency are achieved by dividing the network into disjunct subnetworks on a wavelength basis and by reconfiguring these subnetworks on a time basis. Each subnetwork allows for simplified access to be implemented with fast tunable transceivers each assessing only a moderate number of wavelengths. A performance analysis shows that this concept is most efficient when applied to a high-level broadband interconnection metropolitan area network (MAN...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Department of Communications {{has been}} {{studying}} options for a government-sponsored demonstration payload to be launched {{before the end of}} the century. A summary of the proposed system concepts and network architectures for providing an advanced private business network service at Ku-band and personal and mobile communications at Ka-band is presented. The system aspects addressed include coverage patterns, traffic capacity, and grade of service, multiple access options as well as special problems, such as Doppler in mobile applications. Earth terminal types and the advanced payload concept proposed in a feasibility study for the demonstration mission are described. This concept is a combined Ka-band/Ku-band payload which incorporates a number of advanced satellite technologies including a group demodulator to convert single-channel-per-carrier frequency division multiple access uplink signals to a time division multiplex downlink, on-board signal regeneration, and baseband switching to support packet switched data operation. The on-board processing capability of the payload provides a hubless VSAT architecture which permits single-hop <b>full</b> mesh <b>interconnectivity.</b> The Ka-band and Ku-band portions of the payload are fully integrated through an on-board switch, thereby providing the capability for fully integrated services, such as using the Ku-band VSAT terminals as gateway stations for the Ka-band personal and mobile communications services...|$|R

These matrices enhance satellite capacity by providing <b>full</b> and flexible <b>interconnectivity</b> between the received and transmitted signals and facilitate optimum utilization of system bandwidth. Waveguide and semiconductor technology are two prominent {{candidates for the}} realizing such types of switch matrices. Waveguide switches are dominant in high frequency applications of 100 ? 200 GHz and in high power satellite communication. However, their heavy and bulky profile reinforces {{the need for a}} replacement. In some applications, semiconductor switches are an alternative to mechanical waveguide switches and utilize PIN diodes to create the ON and OFF states. Although, these switches are small in size, they exhibit poor RF performance and low power handling. RF MEMS technology is a good candidate to replace the conventional switches and to realize an entire switch matrix. This technology has a great potential to offer superior RF performance with miniaturized dimensions. Because of the advantages of MEMS technology numerous research studies have been devoted to develop RF MEMS switches. However, they are mostly concentrated on Single-Pole Single-Throw (SPST) configurations and very limited work has been performed on MEMS multi-port switches and switch matrices. Here, this research has been dedicated on developing multi-port RF MEMS switches and amenable interconnect networks for switch matrix applications. To explore the topic, three tasks are considered: planar (2 D) multi-port RF MEMS switches, 3 D multi-port RF MEMS switches, and RF MEMS switch matrix integration. One key objective of this thesis is to investigate novel configurations for planar multi-port (SPNT), C-type, and R-type switches. Such switches represent the basic building blocks of switch matrices operating at microwave frequencies. An in house monolithic fabrication process dedicated to electrostatic multi-port RF MEMS switches is developed and fine tuned. The measurement results exhibit an excellent RF performance verifying the concept. Also, thermally actuated multi-port switches for satellite applications are designed and analyzed. The switch performance at room condition as well as at a very low temperature of 77 K degrees (to resemble the harsh environment of satellite applications) is measured and discussed in detail. For the first time, a new category of 3 D RF MEMS switches is introduced to the MEMS community. These switches are not only extremely useful for high power applications but also have a great potential for high frequencies and millimetre-waves. The concept is based on the integration of vertically actuated MEMS actuators inside 3 D transmission lines such as waveguides and coaxial lines. An SPST and C-type switches based on the integration of rotary thermal and electrostatic actuators are designed and realized. The concept is verified for the frequencies up to 30 GHz with measured results. A high power test analysis and measurement data indicates no major change in performance as high as 13 W. The monolithic integration of the RF MEMS switch matrix involves the design and optimization of a unique interconnect network which is amenable to the MEMS fabrication process. While the switches and interconnect lines are fabricated on the front side, taking advantage of the back side patterning provides a high isolation for cross over junctions. Two different techniques are adopted to optimize the interconnect network. They are based on vertical three-via interconnects and electromagnetically coupled junctions. The data illustrates that for a return loss of less than - 20 dB up to 30 GHz, an isolation of better than 40 dB is obtained. This technique not only eliminates the need for expensive multilayer manufacturing process such as Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) but also provides a unique approach to fabricate the entire switch matrix monolithically...|$|R

In this paper, polyamide and polycaprolactone scaffolds were fabricated using a solid free form technique known as selective laser sintering. These scaffolds had fully interconnected pores, minimized strut thickness, and a porosity of approximately 55 %. Tensile and compression tests as well as finite element analysis were carried out on these scaffolds. It {{was found that the}} values predicted for the effective modulus by the FE model were much higher than the actual values obtained from experimental results.

New opportunities of interconnecting ranges are changing the business of open air range testing and the resulting capabilities. Two predominant opportunities will be discussed in this paper. First, is taking advantage of the fiber glut that the US is currently experiencing along with opportunities for government-acquired assets to service the testing community. This approach provides the government the ability to fiber-optically create a virtual test range and provide <b>full</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> of all data.

40|$|Abstract Controllability of {{scaffold}} {{architecture is}} essential to meet specific criteria for bone tissue engineering implants, including adequate porosity, interconnectivity, and mechanical properties to promote bone growth. Many current scaffold manufacturing techniques induce random porosity in bulk materials, requiring high porosities (> 95 %) to guarantee complete interconnectivity, but the high porosity sacrifices mechanical properties. Additionally, the stochastic arrangement of pores causes scaffold-to-scaffold variation. Here, we introduce a biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold with an inverted colloidal crystal (ICC) structure that provides a highly ordered arrangement of identical spherical cavities. Colloidal crystals (CCs) were constructed with soda lime beads of 100 -, 200 -, and 330 -μm diameters. After the CCs were annealed, they were infiltrated with 85 : 15 PLGA. The method of construction and highly ordered structure allowed for ease of control over cavity and interconnecting channel diameters and for <b>full</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> at lower porosities. The scaffolds demonstrated high mechanical properties for PLGA alone (> 50 [*]MPa), in vitro biocompatibility, and maintenance of osteoblast phenotype, making them promising for a highly controllable bone tissue engineering scaffold...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{way of looking at the}} {{sequence}} of events leading to different styles of silicic, volcanic eruptions. Small-tomedium sized eruptions, either explosive or effusive, are explained by the ascent of isolated magma batches from mid-crustal magma chambers. We separate magma ascent into four different zones: the Supply System, the Intermediate Storage System, the Transport System and the Eruptive System. Of primary importance is the concept that ascent from the Intermediate Storage System through the Transport System to the Eruptive System first requires the development of a fracture network. Initially, this fracture network allows the ascent of individual magma batches by opening and then closing after their passage. An increase in the complexity of the fracture network with time increases the connectivity of the fractures and hence the ease of upward magma movement. In this model, the dynamics of the ensuing eruptions are controlled entirely by the time spent in the Transport System. Large explosive eruptions require a <b>full</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> of the Transport System from the Intermediate Storage System to the Eruptive System. Moreover, we suggest that a fully connected conduit is rare, develops only under particular conditions, and typically generates catastrophic eruptions during formation. Here we examine two case histories that illustrate the interplay of these processes: Mt St. Helens, USA, between 1980 and 2004, and Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines, in 199...|$|E
