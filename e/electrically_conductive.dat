5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive,</b> such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive.</b> A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{improved}} high-frequency {{method for}} solving the bistatic scattering from <b>electrically</b> large <b>conductive</b> targets {{is presented in}} this paper. Since the previous physical optical methods overlooked the current impact of shadow zone {{and led to the}} increasing problems of the large angle bistatic calculation, the improved method is deduced by introducing the current marching technique into the conventional physical optical method. Combined with the graphical-electromagnetic computing method that extracted the illuminated and shadow facet in accordance with the direction of the incident sort iteration, one may calculate the bistatic radar cross-section of a conductive targets object. The numerical results show that this method is efficient and accurate. 1...|$|R

The analysis of the simulation results shows that a clear detection of the conductive parts is achieved if the sensor geometry enforces a non-uniform electrical field distribution in the range of the sensor area. By studying the capacitive coupling to the individual parts of the sensors, design rules for sensor electrode and shielding geometry are deduced...|$|R

40|$|Thermally <b>conductive</b> and <b>electrically</b> {{insulating}} polymer/boron nitride (BN) nanocomposites {{are highly}} attractive for various applications in many thermal management fields. However, so far {{most of the}} preparation methods for polymer/BN nanocomposites have usually caused difficulties in the material post processing. Here, an in situ grafting approach is designed to fabricate thermally <b>conductive,</b> <b>electrically</b> insulating and post-melt processable polystyrene (PS) /BN nanosphere (BNNS) nanocomposites by initiating styrene (St) on the surface functionalized BNNSs via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. For example, at a St/BN feeding ratio of 5 : 1, an enhancement ratio of 1375 % is achieved in comparison with pure PS. Moreover, the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites show a desirable weak dependence on frequency, and the dielectric loss tangent of the nanocomposites remains at a very low level. More importantly, the nanocomposites can be subjected to multiple melt processing to form different shapes. Our method can become a universal approach to prepare thermally <b>conductive,</b> <b>electrically</b> insulating and melt-processable polymer nanocomposites with diverse monomers and nanofillers...|$|R

The established AH-INBCs shielding boundaries are incorporated into a set of implicit equations to calculate the expansion coefficients vectors of electromagnetic fields in the computational domain. The method is free of CFL condition and no convolution integral operation for solving the conventional INBCs-FDTD is involved. Numerical example shows that, compared with analytical solutions and conventional FDTD method, the proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate...|$|R
