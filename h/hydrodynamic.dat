5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} {{field on the}} surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the <b>hydrodynamic</b> behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater jitter during measurements of its radial velocity. Variations of −1 were measured over a 20year period, which is much higher than the measurement uncertainty of −1. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks have {{a complex}} dermal corset made of {{flexible}} collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This {{works as an}} outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them <b>hydrodynamic</b> advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from <b>hydrodynamic</b> theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions have color vision, {{though it}} {{is limited to the}} blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an {{adaptation}} for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. Sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following <b>hydrodynamic</b> trails, although they still perform well.|$|E
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, <b>hydrodynamic</b> and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hydrodynamic</b> wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's {{atmosphere}} allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) is {{also known}} as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or gel filtration chromatography and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their <b>hydrodynamic</b> diameter or <b>hydrodynamic</b> volume).|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} these zones will {{necessarily}} {{be affected by}} the sensory capabilities of the fish. Fish rely on both vision and on <b>hydrodynamic</b> signals relayed through its lateral line. Antarctic krill rely on vision and on <b>hydrodynamic</b> signals relayed through its antennae.|$|E
25|$|It {{would seem}} {{reasonable}} {{to think that}} the regular spacing and size uniformity of fish in schools would result in <b>hydrodynamic</b> efficiencies. However, experiments in the laboratory have failed to find any gains from the <b>hydrodynamic</b> lift created by the neighbours of a fish within a school, though it is still thought that efficiency gains do occur in the wild. Landa (1998) argues that the leader of a school constantly changes, because while being in the body of a school gives a <b>hydrodynamic</b> advantage, being the leader means you are the first to the food.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedback}} is essentially incompressible; {{the speed of}} sound, although finite, is sufficiently large {{that it can be}} considered infinite. This action may be called near field or <b>hydrodynamic</b> feedback. There are a number Class I devices. The feedback that causes a stick in a water stream to vibrate, or a flag to wave, is due to <b>hydrodynamic</b> feedback.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} these zones will {{necessarily}} {{be affected by}} the sensory capabilities of the given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on <b>hydrodynamic</b> perceptions relayed through their lateral line, while Antarctic krill rely both on vision and <b>hydrodynamic</b> signals relayed through antennae.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydrodynamic</b> radius is numerically similar, {{and can be}} {{measured}} with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).|$|E
25|$|The stress terms become highly {{significant}} when performing calculations such as <b>hydrodynamic</b> simulations of core-collapse supernovae.|$|E
25|$|By July 2010 the {{replacement}} of turbine 3 was underway and should be completed in December 2010. The new turbine has better electrical and <b>hydrodynamic</b> characteristics and a 40-year working life.|$|E
25|$|Biofouling occurs {{everywhere}} but is {{most significant}} economically to the shipping industries, since fouling on a ship's hull significantly increases drag, reducing the overall <b>hydrodynamic</b> {{performance of the}} vessel, and increases the fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|James Watt of Scotland {{is widely}} {{given credit for}} {{applying}} the first screw propeller to an engine at his Birmingham works, an early steam engine, beginning {{the use of an}} <b>hydrodynamic</b> screw for propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The Potez-CAMS 160 was a one-off 5/13 scale {{flight model}} built in France, first flown {{in the summer}} of 1938 to test {{aerodynamic}} and <b>hydrodynamic</b> qualities of the Potez-CAMS 161 airliner and mail carrier, which was too large for detailed modelling in existing wind tunnels.|$|E
25|$|Fish derive many {{benefits}} from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting {{the chance of}} capture), enhanced foraging success, and higher success in finding a mate. It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased <b>hydrodynamic</b> efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{the buildup}} of {{biofouling}} on marine vessels poses a significant problem. In some instances, the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged. The accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can increase both the <b>hydrodynamic</b> volume of a vessel and the <b>hydrodynamic</b> friction, leading to increased drag of up to 60%. The drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising {{up to half of}} marine transport costs, antifouling methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around $60 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72% by 2020.|$|E
25|$|The {{elliptical}} planform keel {{is designed}} by C and fabricated by Mars Metal (MarsKeel). The keel is of lead alloyed with antimony for added strength and cast to exacting tolerances. In {{addition to providing}} the yacht's stability, the foil shape of the keel produces <b>hydrodynamic</b> lift while sailing to weather, enhancing upwind performance.|$|E
25|$|The trains {{feature a}} {{hydraulic}} transmission, supplied by Voith {{which is a}} three-speed type, with integral <b>hydrodynamic</b> braking (rated at 750kW short term, 420kW continuous). These trains are the only diesel-powered high-speed trains {{in the world with}} diesel-hydraulic transmission. One bogie per coach is powered, with both axles driven. Total vehicle weight is 278 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Long homopolymers of {{amino acids}} often form helices if soluble. Such long, {{isolated}} helices {{can also be}} detected by other methods, such as dielectric relaxation, flow birefringence, and measurements of the diffusion constant. In stricter terms, these methods detect only the characteristic prolate (long cigar-like) <b>hydrodynamic</b> shape of a helix, or its large dipole moment.|$|E
25|$|Adsorbents {{are used}} {{usually in the}} form of spherical pellets, rods, moldings, or monoliths with a <b>hydrodynamic</b> radius between 0.25 and 5mm. They must have high {{abrasion}} resistance, high thermal stability and small pore diameters, which results in higher exposed surface area and hence high capacity for adsorption. The adsorbents must also have a distinct pore structure that enables fast transport of the gaseous vapors.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{researchers}} at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign created a three-dimensional, <b>hydrodynamic</b> simulation of the Chicago River, which suggested that density currents are the cause of an observed bi-directional wintertime flow in the river. At the surface, the river flows east to west, away from Lake Michigan, as expected. But deep below, near the riverbed, water seasonally travels west to east, toward the lake.|$|E
25|$|Re-opened as {{a museum}} in 1982, it retains many of its {{original}} features, including the 100-meter-long ship testing tank, {{as long as a}} football pitch, which although demonstrated from time to time, lacks instrumentations and can no longer be used for <b>hydrodynamic</b> research and testing. The museum also {{tells the story of the}} test tank's original owners, William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton; one of the most innovative shipbuilding companies in the world, until their closure in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the program date back to 1960, when a Pacific White-sided Dolphin was {{acquired}} for <b>hydrodynamic</b> studies seeking to improve torpedo performance. The aim {{was to determine whether}} dolphins had a sophisticated drag-reduction system, but the technology of the day failed to demonstrate that dolphins have any unusual capabilities in this respect. This research has now resumed with the benefit of modern-day technology; among the possible drag-reducing mechanisms being studied for human use are skin compliance, biopolymers, and boundary-layer heating.|$|E
25|$|Periodic {{vibration}} of a {{cyclone separator}} would indicate vortex instability. Large centrifugal fans sometimes use radial inlet blades {{that can be}} rotated to control the flow into the fan; they create a swirling flow. At near shutoff, where the swirl is very high, rotating blade stall of the fan blades occurs. Although not researched, it is highly likely that swirl instability is the cause. The feedback is clearly <b>hydrodynamic</b> (Class I) {{and there is no}} indication that more than one stage occurs.|$|E
25|$|However {{technology}} {{also allows}} for a multitude of smaller workstations in a classroom setting. Administrators network student workstations so that the instructor can launch individual scenarios at each station. Computer models are used to accurately simulate conditions such as wind, seas, and currents. Moreover, shallow-water effects or other <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces, such as ships passing close to each other, can also be depicted. A computer application records training sessions, complete with voice commands issued by the instructor which are received by the students via a headset.|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{algorithms}} {{follow a}} Lagrangian approach or an Eulerian approach. The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a field, {{working with the}} density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a <b>hydrodynamic</b> approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms. However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an agent-based model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. Individual particle models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the Eulerian approach.|$|E
25|$|Otter {{trawling}} derives {{its name}} from the large rectangular otter boards which are used to keep the mouth of the trawl net open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a plough, digging up to 15cm into the seabed, creating a turbid cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.|$|E
500|$|Dynamic testing {{examined}} [...] "the vehicle's {{response to}} lateral, longitudinal, and torsional excitation, simulating those {{that would be}} experienced in flight. [...] The vehicle was [...] "mounted on a <b>hydrodynamic</b> support system made up of four hydraulic/pneumatic pedestals to permit a simulated unrestrained reaction." [...] Engineers tested vibrations in one plane at a time with different amounts of ballast simulating [...] "fuel load at critical time points in the flight trajectory." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{technology}} was improved, and by 1951 the four ionization chambers {{were replaced by}} twenty scintillation counters, each using five gallons of a liquid scintillator. The flashes from [...] of burning scintillator were remarkably brilliant {{in the early morning}} times when the tests were usually performed. RaLa tests continued until 1962, after which they were replaced by more advanced methods. Currently several other methods are used for <b>hydrodynamic</b> testing.|$|E
500|$|Biologists have {{considered}} other senses that {{may contribute to}} animal navigation. Many marine animals such as seals are capable of <b>hydrodynamic</b> reception, enabling them to track and catch prey such as fish by sensing the disturbances their passage leaves behind in the water. Marine mammals such as dolphins, [...] and many species of bat, are capable of echolocation, which they use both for detecting prey and for orientation by sensing their environment.|$|E
