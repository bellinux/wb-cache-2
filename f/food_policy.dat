25|$|According to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian {{population}} and about 75% of South Asia's poor live {{in rural areas}} and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2015, approximately 281 {{million people in the}} region were malnourished. The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population. Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National <b>Food</b> <b>Policy</b> frameworkwith only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend.There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990sa number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished. Approximately 194.6 million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{childhood}} obesity epidemic, the European Commission and Member States have developed the EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity 2014 - 2020. Supporting its implementation, the JRC has been facilitating knowledge exchange by mapping national school <b>food</b> <b>policies</b> and fostering stakeholder dialogue. To provide further insight into the various school <b>food</b> <b>policies</b> in place across Europe, the JRC has produced country factsheets that answer questions such as: what are the common objectives of school <b>food</b> <b>policies</b> in Europe? Which nutrient-based standards are used for lunch-time meals? Which countries restrict food marketing in schools, and how? Country by country, the factsheets give details about policy objectives, evaluation measures, food- and nutrient-based standards or guidelines, restrictions on vending services and food marketing in schools, and whether food and nutrition education is a mandatory {{part of the national}} curriculum. The information is complemented by key figures on population size and the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in different age groups. JRC. F. 1 -Health in Societ...|$|R

40|$|Government {{actors have}} an {{important}} role to play in creating healthy public policies and supportive environments to facilitate access to safe, affordable, nutritious food. The purpose of this research was to examine Waterloo Region (Ontario, Canada) as a case study for “what works” with respect to facilitating access to healthy, local food through regional <b>food</b> system <b>policy</b> making. Policy and planning approaches were explored through multi-sectoral perspectives of: (a) the development and adoption of <b>food</b> <b>policies</b> as part of the comprehensive planning process; (b) barriers to food system planning; and (c) the role and motivation of the Region’s public health and planning departments in <b>food</b> system <b>policy</b> making. Forty-seven in-depth interviews with decision makers, experts in public health and planning, and local food system stakeholders provided rich insight into strategic government actions, as well as the local and historical context within which <b>food</b> system <b>policies</b> were developed. Grounded theory methods were used to identify key overarching themes including: “strategic positioning”, “partnerships” and “knowledge transfer” and related sub-themes (“aligned agendas”, “issue framing”, “visioning” and “legitimacy”).
