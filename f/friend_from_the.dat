5|$|Johann Peter Hebel (10 May 1760– 22 September 1826) was a German {{short story}} writer, dialectal poet, evangelical theologian and pedagogue, most famous for a {{collection}} of Alemannic lyric poems (Allemannische Gedichte) and one of German tales (Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreundes Treasure Chest of the Family <b>Friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rhine).|$|E
5|$|A <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{discussion}} group, {{who uses}} the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying {{a friend of a}} friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, a <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jacaranda, {{heard about}} Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry {{to a local}} civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks, covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia gave up her accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a desk, chair and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E

5|$|The Dirty War {{eventually}} ended, and the National Reorganization Process allowed {{political activity}} {{in preparation for}} a return to democracy. Kirchner led one of the three internal factions of the local Justicialist Party (PJ), but Peronist Arturo Puricelli prevailed in the primary elections. Kirchner founded the Ateneo Juan Domingo Perón organization, which supported deposed president Isabel Perón and promoted political dialogue with the military. Cristina Fernández became an attorney of the PJ in Santa Cruz, with the help of Rafael Flores, a former <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> FURN. Raúl Alfonsín, who was running for president for the Radical Civic Union (UCR), denounced an agreement between the military and the Peronist unions which sought an amnesty for the military. Kirchner organized a rally on behalf of Rodolfo Ponce, a union leader mentioned by Alfonsín in his denouncement. Alfonsín won the 1983 presidential election, and Puricelli was elected governor of Santa Cruz. Puricelli sought to unify the local Peronist movement by adding members of the other factions into his government, and appointed Kirchner president of the provincial social-welfare fund.|$|E

25|$|Bankhead {{appeared}} in a revival of Noël Coward's Private Lives, taking it on tour and then to Broadway {{for the better part}} of two years. The play's run made Bankhead a fortune. From that time, Bankhead could command 10% of the gross and was billed larger than any other actor in the cast, although she usually granted equal billing to Estelle Winwood, a frequent co-star and close <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1920s until Bankhead's death in 1968.|$|E

She reconnected with Marella Caracciolo Agnelli, a <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s in New York, and told Agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden.

Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration {{and a piece of}} bread to Levi without asking for anything in return.

Ellyson was accepted {{and went on}} to become Naval Aviator No. 1 in 1911, but Whiting was not and continued his submarine duties. On 29 June 1914, however, Whiting finally began his career in naval aviation, the field in which he was to make his name as a true pioneer, when he reported to the Wright Company at Dayton, Ohio, to learn to fly. The last naval officer to take flight training from Orville Wright personally, Whiting was designated Naval Aviator No. 16 on 6 September 1914.|$|E
25|$|Sulley {{was born}} in Sheffield, UK on 22 March 1963. She was raised and spent all her early years in the Gleadless suburb of the city. For her final {{education}} she attended the city's Frecheville Comprehensive School from the late 1970s until mid 1981. Her best <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> age of 13 was fellow lifelong Sheffield resident and Frecheville student Joanne Catherall. By early 1981 she was calling herself 'Susanne Sulley', a familiar amalgamation of her two first names, a nickname by which she had been casually known at school. In 1980 while still at school she had a part-time job in a Sheffield hairdressing salon and a casual summer job selling ice cream at a Sheffield cinema, the only jobs she has had in her life apart from music.|$|E

25|$|During this time, {{legislation}} {{had been}} passed allowing the licensing of commercial radio stations in the UK. One of the first, Capital Radio, began broadcasting to London and the Home Counties in October 1973. Everett joined the station and was given a weekend show,(recorded) where he further developed his distinctive ideas. From January 1974, following poor audience figures which in turn followed a difficult start for Capital {{during a time of}} industrial strife, the station changed to a more pop based, rather than light music, format, with Kenny presenting the breakfast show with his former colleague and <b>friend</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pirate station Radio London (Big L) days, Dave Cash, and so re-activating the 'Kenny and Cash' show. When Dave Cash moved to the lunchtime slot in 1975, Kenny continued alone on the breakfast show. Everett had a great love of sound recording equipment, in particular using reel-to-reel tape recorders and mixing equipment, often adding sound-on-sound to his recordings and stereo/multi-track recordings of his pseudo-singing voice. These were broadcast on air regularly and he often created his own radio jingles. Everett created many comedy characters on The Breakfast Show with Dave Cash on Capital.|$|E
