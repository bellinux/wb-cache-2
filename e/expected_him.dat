5|$|In 2015, Dickinson {{underwent}} {{seven weeks}} of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour {{found at the}} back of his tongue. Dickinson's medical team <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to make a full recovery as the tumour was discovered in the early stages. On 15 May, Dickinson was given the all-clear by his specialists.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Allied commanders and the German high command <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to be present for any invasion of France. Clarke hoped Montgomery's apparent presence in Gibraltar and Africa would lend support to the idea that the Allies might be planning landings in southern France, as part of Operation Vendetta, rather than across the Channel. While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and Ops (B) drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to support the Church's teachings.|$|E

5|$|Both faced {{disastrous}} marches across Anatolia in {{the months}} that followed, and most of their armies were destroyed. Louis abandoned his troops and travelled by ship to the Principality of Antioch, where his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine's uncle, Raymond, was prince. Raymond <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to offer military assistance against the Seljuk Turks threatening the principality, but Louis refused and went to Jerusalem to fulfil his crusader vow. Conrad, stricken by illness, had earlier returned to Constantinople, but arrived in Jerusalem a few weeks later in early April 1148. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
5|$|When the Danes stalled and {{prolonged}} {{the fulfillment of}} some provisions of the Treaty of Roskilde by postponing payments and not blocking foreign fleets from access to the Baltic Sea, and {{with half of the}} 2,000 Danish soldiers that were obliged by Roskilde to enter Swedish service deserting, the Swedish king embarked from Kiel with a force of 10,000 men on 16 August. While everyone <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to head for Royal Prussia, he disembarked on Zealand on 17 August, and headed for Copenhagen, which was defended by 10,650 Danes and 2,000 Dutch. This time however, the town did not surrender, and a long siege ensued. When Swedish forces took Kronborg in September, they controlled both sides of the Øresund, yet in November a Dutch fleet broke the Swedish naval blockade of Copenhagen in the Battle of the Sound.|$|E

5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Bill Hedrick {{ran against}} Calvert again. While most pundits such as Larry Sabato <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to lose again, {{sources such as}} The New York Times ranked the race more competitive.

25|$|The allies' indecision {{and lack}} of {{preparation}} {{would come back to}} haunt them. It turned out that Tabinshwehti had decided to attack Prome right after the rainy season when no one <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to. He secretly prepared for war throughout the rainy season (June to October) of 1541. Only King Minkhaung of Prome reinforced his city's defensive fortifications, and stockpiled supplies and provisions.|$|E
25|$|Leadbeater {{stayed in}} India until 1915, {{overseeing}} {{the education of}} Krishnamurti; he then relocated to Australia. During the late 1920s, Krishnamurti disavowed the role that Leadbeater and other Theosophists <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to fulfil. He disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its doctrines and practices, and during the next six decades became known as an influential speaker on philosophical and religious subjects.|$|E
25|$|In March 1910, J. W. H. Pollard {{announced}} his resignation as {{head football coach}} and athletic director, and took the same positions at Washington and Lee University. After several months of searching for a replacement, in August the University's Committee on Athletics hired Guy Lowman from the University of Missouri to serve as both head football coach and athletic director. With his hiring, many <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to successfully guide the football team through what was viewed as it's toughest schedule in school history.|$|E

25|$|As a {{child he}} worked shining shoes and selling {{newspapers}} and lottery tickets. When, at age 11, he finished grade school, his father <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to leave school {{and get a}} job to support the family. With his teacher's encouragement, Toledo was able to continue his schooling by working nights and weekends, becoming the first person in his family to attend high school. Toledo eventually found employment as a news correspondent for La Prensa in Chimbote, where he interviewed several high-ranking politicians.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{election}} of 1764 {{resulted in the}} elevation of Stanisław August Poniatowski, a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to the Czartoryski family, but hand-picked and imposed by Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, who <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to be her obedient follower. Stanisław August ruled the Polish–Lithuanian state until its dissolution in 1795. The king spent his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save the failing state and the perceived necessity of remaining in a subordinate relationship to his Russian sponsors.|$|E
25|$|United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also {{condemned}} these policy {{positions on}} a short visit to India in July 1971, particularly when Subrahmanyam told Kissinger that he <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> to be more considerate on account of Kissinger's own experience with genocide, having himself escaped the Holocaust. In spite of these many objections the substance of Subrahmanyam's views swiftly gained ground {{and led to the}} Indian government's examination of various military options. These culminated in India's December 1971 war with Pakistan, its victory, and the subsequent creation of Bangladesh.|$|E
