50|$|A balestron rig is a sailplan {{involving}} a boom that extends forwards of the mast and <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> on it. It is a balanced rig. It involves a mainsail {{and a smaller}} jib on an unstayed mast.|$|R
30|$|All {{these results}} lead to {{conclude}} that multidimensional communities <b>are</b> <b>pivoted</b> by SMS communities which are merged in greater multidimensional communities by means of call links, whereas SMS links bring portions of call communities into different multidimensional communities.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{the term}} {{refers to the}} {{structural}} component that attaches the undercarriage or landing gear to the airframe. For aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear, the trunnion <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> to permit rotation of the entire gear assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Tongs {{which have}} long arms {{terminating}} in small flat circular ends of tongs and <b>are</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{close to the}} handle, as in the common fire-tongs, used for picking up pieces of coal and placing them on a fire.|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} stabilizer provides directional (or yaw) stability and usually comprises a fixed fin and movable control rudder hinged to its rear edge. Less commonly, {{there is no}} hinge and the whole fin surface <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> for both stability and control.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rodgers Anchor. The arms, de, df {{were formed}} in one piece, and <b>were</b> <b>pivoted</b> at the crown d on a bolt {{passing through the}} forked shank ab. The points or pees e, f, to the palms g were blunt.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pivot</b> coding <b>is</b> also {{a common}} method of {{translating}} data for computer systems. For example, the internet protocol, XML and high level languages <b>are</b> <b>pivot</b> codings of computer data {{which are then}} often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.|$|R
50|$|Some string {{trimmers}} {{are designed}} {{so that they can}} be easily maneuvered with their head being positioned vertically instead of the default horizontal. Other string trimmers come with specific lawn edging attachments, or the one head can <b>be</b> <b>pivoted</b> to <b>be</b> realigned vertically.|$|R
5000|$|The {{elements}} below <b>pivots</b> <b>are</b> {{zero and}} elements above <b>pivots</b> <b>are</b> nonnegative and strictly {{smaller than the}} pivot.|$|R
50|$|At high speeds, both subsonic and supersonic, {{the wing}} would <b>be</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{at up to}} 60 degrees to the aircraft's {{fuselage}} for better high-speed performance. The studies showed these angles would decrease aerodynamic drag, permitting increased speed and longer range with the same fuel expenditure.|$|R
50|$|The NASA AD-1 {{was both}} an {{aircraft}} and an associated flight test program conducted between 1979 and 1982 at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards California, which successfully demonstrated an aircraft wing that could <b>be</b> <b>pivoted</b> obliquely {{from zero to}} 60 degrees during flight.|$|R
50|$|Inboard-Outboard drives are a hybrid, with {{an engine}} block mounted within the hull, but {{linked to a}} lower drive unit mounted to the transom {{containing}} the propeller which <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> for steering the craft, similar to an outboard motor. An outdrive {{also serves as a}} rudder.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the seconds}} hand is co-axial with the minute and hour hand, that <b>is</b> it <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{at the center}} of the dial, this {{arrangement}} is called [...] "center seconds" [...] or [...] "sweep seconds", because the seconds hand sweeps around the minute track on the dial.|$|R
60|$|It was then, {{when the}} mustangs <b>were</b> <b>pivoting,</b> {{with the white}} in the lead, that Jones jumped upon the stone, fired his pistol and roared with all his strength. Taking his cue, I did likewise. The band huddled back again, {{uncertain}} and frightened, then broke up the canyon.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when the}} capsule <b>was</b> <b>pivoted</b> to its stowing {{position}} behind the cockpit, {{it made it}} impossible to kayak roll due to being filled with water like a bucket. Therefore, whenever he capsized, he had to swim out of the kayak, push it upright and perform full self-rescue.|$|R
50|$|The driving spring {{assemblies}} {{held the}} lock frame against the carrier dog until the carrier {{was released by}} carrier catch which <b>was</b> <b>pivoted</b> by the incoming round. The springs then drove the lock frame assembly forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round and raise the breech block.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third of this <b>was</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{so that the}} Redoubt could <b>be</b> isolated. The <b>pivot</b> and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent unauthorised entry and vandalism.|$|R
50|$|The {{sunlight}} concentrated at {{the focal}} {{line of a}} spherical reflector is collected using a tracking receiver. This receiver <b>is</b> <b>pivoted</b> around the focal line and is usually counterbalanced. The receiver may consist of pipes carrying fluid for thermal transfer or photovoltaic cells for direct conversion of light to electricity.|$|R
5000|$|A fixed {{tricycle}} landing gear, mounted {{close to}} the fuselage to lessen aerodynamic drag, gave the aircraft a very [...] "squatty" [...] appearance on the ground. It was only 6.75 ft high. The wing <b>was</b> <b>pivoted</b> by an electrically driven gear mechanism located inside the fuselage, just forward of the engines.|$|R
