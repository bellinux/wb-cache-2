With no financial resources, and no skills {{on which to}} trade, for many women a sale {{was the only way}} out of an unhappy marriage. Indeed, the wife is sometimes reported as having insisted on the sale. A wife sold in Wenlock Market for 2s. 6d. in 1830 was quite determined that the transaction should go ahead, despite her husband's last-minute misgivings: e [...] turned shy, and tried {{to get out of the}} business, but Mattie mad' un stick to it.

She proclaims in the lyrics [...] "I conjure up {{the thought of being}} gone, but I’d {{probably}} even do that wrong." [...] In [...] "Glitter in the Air", Pink asks many questions such as, [...] "Have you ever looked fear in the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I just don’t care?", and [...] "Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?" [...] Pink admits, [...] "I still don’t have some of the answers to the questions I pose on this record. I’m still figuring it all out." ...|$|E

The neighbor said that the youth pulled the cap over his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, Jesus!" [...] as he sprinted by. Other neighbors claimed to have seen the [...] "teenager", as well as another person matching Berkowitz's description, loitering separately {{in the area for}} about an hour before the shooting.

Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you."
