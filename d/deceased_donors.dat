25|$|It is {{accepted}} that kidney transplantation {{is the preferred}} treatment for ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Among American patients on the kidney transplant waiting list (as of December 2011), 7256 (8.4%) were listed due to cystic kidney disease and of the 16,055 renal transplants performed in 2011, 2057 (12.8%) were done for patients with cystic kidney disease, with 1,189 from <b>deceased</b> <b>donors</b> and 868 from living donors.|$|E
25|$|While {{offering}} {{income tax}} deductions {{has been the}} preferred method of providing tax incentives, some commentators have expressed concern that these incentives provide disproportionate benefits to wealthier donors. Tax credits, on the other hand, are perceived as more equitable since the after tax benefit of the incentive is not tied to the marginal tax rate of the donor. Additional tax favored approaches have been proposed for organ donation, including providing: tax credits {{to the families of}} <b>deceased</b> <b>donors</b> (seeking to encourage consent), refundable tax credits (similar to the earned income credit) to provide greater tax equity among potential donors, and charitable deductions for the donation of blood or organs.|$|E
25|$|Organ donors may {{be living}} or may {{have died of}} brain death or circulatory death. Most <b>deceased</b> <b>donors</b> {{are those who have}} been {{pronounced}} brain dead. Brain dead means the cessation of brain function, typically after receiving an injury (either traumatic or pathological) to the brain, or otherwise cutting off blood circulation to the brain (drowning, suffocation, etc.). Breathing is maintained via artificial sources, which, in turn, maintains heartbeat. Once brain death has been declared the person can be considered for organ donation. Criteria for brain death vary. Because less than 3% of all deaths in the U.S. are the result of brain death, the overwhelming majority of deaths are ineligible for organ donation, resulting in severe shortages.|$|E

25|$|By the 1990s, growing {{concerns}} about possible abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups {{and human rights}} organizations to start condemning China’s use of prisoner organs. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese military doctor testified before U.S. Congress {{that he had taken}} part in organ extraction operations from executed prisoners, some of whom were not yet dead. In December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu acknowledged that up to 95% of transplant organs came from executed prisoners and promised steps to prevent abuse. Huang reiterated these claims in 2008 and 2010, stating that over 90% of organ transplants from <b>deceased</b> <b>donors</b> are sourced from prisoners. In 2006 the World Medical Association demanded that China cease harvesting organs from prisoners, who are not deemed able to properly consent. In 2014, Huang Jiefu said that reliance on organ harvesting from death row inmates was declining, while simultaneously defending the practice of using prisoners’ organs in the transplantation system.|$|E
25|$|An {{academic}} institution {{devoted to the}} science of blood transfusion was founded by Alexander Bogdanov in Moscow in 1925. Bogdanov was motivated, at least in part, by a search for eternal youth, and remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms after receiving 11 transfusions of whole blood. Bogdanov died in 1928 {{as a result of}} one of his experiments, when the blood of a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis was given to him in a transfusion. Following Bogdanov's lead, Vladimir Shamov and Sergei Yudin in the USSR pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood from recently <b>deceased</b> <b>donors.</b> Yudin performed such a transfusion successfully {{for the first time on}} March 23, 1930 and reported his first seven clinical transfusions with cadaveric blood at the Fourth Congress of Ukrainian Surgeons at Kharkiv in September.

2500|$|<b>Deceased</b> <b>donors</b> (formerly cadaveric) {{are people}} who have been {{declared}} brain-dead and whose organs are kept viable by ventilators or other mechanical mechanisms until they can be excised for transplantation. Apart from brain-stem dead donors, who have formed the majority of <b>deceased</b> <b>donors</b> for the last 20 years, there is increasing use of donation-after-circulatory-death-donors (formerly non-heart-beating donors) to increase the potential pool of donors as demand for transplants continues to grow. Prior to the recognition of brain death in the 1980s, all deceased organ donors had died of circulatory death. [...] These organs have inferior outcomes to organs from a brain-dead donor. For instance, patients who underwent liver transplantation using donation-after-circulatory- death (DCD) allografts have been shown to have significantly lower graft survival than those from donation-after-brain-death (DBD) allografts due to biliary complications and PNF. However, given the scarcity of suitable organs and {{the number of people who}} die waiting, any potentially suitable organ must be considered.|$|E
40|$|Background. Increasing {{numbers of}} older {{patients}} are developing established renal failure and considering kidney transplant as a renal replacement therapy (RRT) option. The probability of older patients actually receiving a <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplant is unclear, preventing informed choice about pursuing {{the option of}} transplantation. We sought to analyse our RRT population to determine the probability of receiving a <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplant in patients commencing RRT categorized by age and for whom there was no suitable living kidney donor. Methods. Patients commencing dialysis in our centre between 1992 and 2009 were identified. Time to listing on the <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> transplant waiting list and time to first <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> transplant were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis for patients, categorized by age, with censoring at the date of first living donor kidney transplant, death or last dialysis.

40|$|Contemporary {{studies have}} not {{comprehensively}} compared waiting times and determinants of <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation across all major racial {{ethnic groups in}} the Unites States. Here, we compared relative rates and determinants of waitlisting and <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation among 503, 090 nonelderly adults of different racial ethnic groups who initiated hemodialysis between 1995 and 2006 with follow-up through 2008. Annual rates of <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> transplantation from the time of dialysis initiation were lowest in American Indians/Alaska Natives (2. 4 %) and blacks (2. 8 %), intermediate in Pacific Islanders (3. 1 %) and Hispanics (3. 2 %), and highest in whites (5. 9 %) and Asians (6. 4 %). Lower rates of <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> transplantation among most racial ethnic minority groups appeared primarily to reflect differences in time from waitlisting to transplantation, but this was not the result of higher rates of waitlist inactivity or removal from the waitlist. The fraction of the reduced transplant rates attributable to measured factors (e. g., demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic factors) varied from 14 % in blacks to 43 % in American Indians/Alaska Natives compared with whites. In conclusion, adjusted rates of <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation remain significantly lower among racial ethnic minorities compared with whites; generally, differences in time to waitlisting were not as pronounced as differences in time between waitlisting and transplantation. Determinants of delays in time to transplantation differed substantially by racial ethnic group. Area-based efforts targeted to address racial- and ethnic-specific delays in transplantation may help to reduce overall disparities in <b>deceased</b> <b>donor</b> kidney transplantation in the United States...|$|R
2500|$|In {{carefully}} screened kidney donors, {{survival and}} the risk of end-stage renal disease appear to be similar to those in the general population. However, women who have donated a kidney have a higher risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia than matched nondonors with similar indicators of baseline health. Traditionally, the donor procedure has been through a single incision of , but live donation is being increasingly performed by laparoscopic surgery. This reduces pain and accelerates recovery for the donor. Operative time and complications decreased significantly after a surgeon performed 150 cases. [...] Live donor kidney grafts have higher long-term success rates than those from <b>deceased</b> <b>donors.</b> [...] Since the increase in the use of laparoscopic surgery, the number of live donors has increased. [...] Any advance which leads to a decrease in pain and scarring and swifter recovery has the potential to boost donor numbers. [...] In January 2009, the first all-robotic kidney transplant was performed at Saint Barnabas Medical Center through a two-inch incision. In the following six months, the same team performed eight more robotic-assisted transplants.|$|E
2500|$|Over 121,000 {{people in}} need of an organ are on the U.S. {{government}} waiting list. This crisis within the United States is growing rapidly because on average there are only 30,000 transplants performed each year. More than 8,000 people die each year from lack of a donor organ, an average of 22 people a day. Between the years 1988 and 2006 the number of transplants doubled, {{but the number of}} patients waiting for an organ grew six times as large. It has been estimated that the number of organs donated would double if every person with suitable organs decided to donate. In the past presumed consent was urged to try to decrease the need for organs. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1987 was adopted in several states, and allowed medical examiners to determine if organs and tissues of cadavers could be donated. By the 1980s, several states adopted different laws that allowed only certain tissues or organs to be retrieved and donated, some allowed all, and some did not allow any without consent of the family. In 2006 when the UAGA was revised, the idea of presumed consent was abandoned. In the United States today, organ donation is done only with consent of the family or donator themselves. According to economist Alex Tabarrok, the shortage of organs has increased the use of so-called expanded criteria organs, or organs that used to be considered unsuitable for transplant. Five patients that received kidney transplants at the University of Maryland School of Medicine developed cancerous or benign tumors which had to be removed. The head surgeon, Dr. Michael Phelan, explained that [...] "the ongoing shortage of organs from <b>deceased</b> <b>donors,</b> and the high risk of dying while waiting for a transplant, prompted five donors and recipients to push ahead with the surgery." [...] Several organizations such as the American Kidney Fund are pushing for opt-out organ donation in the United States.|$|E
