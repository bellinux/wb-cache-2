25|$|When a {{hypothesis}} proves unsatisfactory, {{it is either}} modified or discarded. If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into {{the framework of a}} scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than {{a hypothesis}}; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.|$|E
