Between January 2012 and December 2012, we performed transthoracic minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>device</b> closure of atrial septal defects in 95 patients with secundum atrial septal defects (ASD), and performed transthoracic echocardiography to measure blood flow velocities at the tricuspid valve orifice {{and at the}} pulmonary valve orifice, sizes of {{the left and right}} atria and ventricles, right ventricular fractional area change, right ventricular Tei index, three-dimensional right ventricular ejection fraction, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and left ventricular ejection fractions before the procedure and 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year post-procedure.

Material and Method: Two hundred forty patient included in the prospective active surveillance study that was conducted in Bakırköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Research and Training Hospital PICU department between January 2008 and July 2009. Center of Disease Control methodology has been used for data collecting and calculating rates. Results: Eleven <b>invasive</b> <b>device</b> related nosocomial infection were detected in 240 patients and 2909 patient days for overall rate of 4. 58 % and 3. 78 infections per 1000 days. Ventilator utilisation rate was found to be 53 % and ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ventilator day was 4. 53. Urinary catheter utilization rate was 14 %, urinary catheter related urinary system infection rate was 4. 75 / 1000 urinary catheter days. Central catheter utilization rate was 22 %, central catheter related bloodstream infection rate was 3. 16 / 1000 catheter days. Coagulase-negative stafilococcus (% 26. 09), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (% 13. 04), Escherichia coli (% 13. 04), Staphylococcus aureus (% 8. 70), Candida spp (% 8. 70), Acinetobacter baumannii (% 4. 35), Enterobacter aerogenes (% 4. 35), enterococcus faecium (% 4. 35), Proteus mirabilis (% 4. 35) were the most common microorganisms isolated.

From January 2000 to December 2001, 416 trauma patients were admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hours, the mean length of stay was 9. 3 days (range 2 - 65) and 188 (45 %) patients developed a total of 290 NI.

A case-control study using two randomly selected VRE-negative controls for each positive case was performed to assess risk-factors for VRE colonisation by univariate and multivariate analysis. VRE faecal colonisation was documented in 53 (14. 3 %) of 370 patients screened. Previous exposure to anti-anaerobic agents, as well as quinolones, was associated with VRE colonisation (p < 0. 05).

In case of caesarean section, advanced monitoring allows to optimize haemodynamic condition and to improve morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of pulse contour analysis calibrated by Trans-pulmonar thermodilution (Picco Plus® for the perioperative management of a caesarean section in a patient with severe cardiomyopathy. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 28 -year-old woman with a congenital heart disease who was submitted to a caesarean section under general anaesthesia for maternal pathology and foetal breech presentation. Intra- and post-operative management was optimized by advanced haemodynamic monitorization obtained by pulse contour wave analysis and thermodilution calibration (Picco Plus® monitor).

MethodsTwenty-one patients aged 11 months to 12 years (median age, 3. 6 years) with isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects underwent minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>device</b> closure with an inferior sternotomy of 3 to 5 cm under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. A single per–right ventricular U-like suture was established, and a new delivery system was introduced, aided by a 16 -gauge trocar, including a guidewire, proper sheath, and loading sheath. The proper size of devices was determined by means of transesophageal echocardiographic analysis, and then the device was released under real-time transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring if no significant aortic regurgitation, abnormal atrioventricular valvular motion, or residual interventricular shunt appeared.
