5|$|Although {{considered}} disgusting in Western culture, cockroaches are eaten <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> {{around the}} world. Whereas household pest cockroaches may carry bacteria and viruses, cockroaches bred under laboratory conditions {{can be used}} to prepare nutritious food. Common household cockroaches can be decontaminated by being isolated and fed a diet of apple and lettuce.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk {{performed}} {{live without}} costumes <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> including the United States. In 1996, the duo were featured at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin, their first public {{performance in the}} U.S. In addition to live original performances, they performed {{a number of times}} in various clubs using vinyl records from their collection.

5|$|Service roads allowed {{engineers}} to separate local access {{from the highway}} and avoid space-consuming interchanges <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places.</b> As such, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then Highway25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then Highway122), Erin Mills Parkway, Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then Highway10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and Highway27.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny {{is seen in the}} sheared rock and cleaved shales. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places,</b> has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon fresco. Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco but added a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E
50|$|Convergence {{occurs when}} place names drift towards other {{familiar}} phonemes in place names; e.g. in Abingdon (Aebbeduna, 'Aebbe's hill'), the middle sound has converged {{to the familiar}} 'ing' found <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>place</b> names (usually meaning 'people of').|$|R
50|$|Bosc {{is an old}} French {{word meaning}} bois (wood), {{deriving}} from the Germanic bosk which {{is related to the}} Latin boscus. The same word occurs in Norman. It can be found <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>place</b> names and surnames.|$|R

5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles as there is in adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though it occurs <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates {{back more than}} 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1776 an iron entrepreneur, a Mr Cox, {{recognised}} {{the potential}} {{that the site}} offered and started to build his iron mill which became known as Coxes Lock Mill (pre-dating the adoption of apostrophes <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>place</b> names <b>in</b> the English Language).|$|R
5000|$|Termonn is an Irish (Gaelic) {{word meaning}} [...] "sanctuary, boundary". Other spellings include tearmann, tarman and termondd.

The word is common <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>place</b> names <b>in</b> Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Paleo-Sardinian {{language}} are currently not known. Research has attempted to discover obscure, indigenous, pre-Romance roots; the root s(a)rd, present <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>place</b> names and denoting the island's people, is reportedly from Sherden (one of the Sea Peoples), although this assertion is hotly debated.|$|R
5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places.</b> Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies {{invaded the}} Italian mainland, {{following}} Italy's armistice with the Allies. Germany {{with the help}} of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines. German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.|$|E
5|$|Parks are {{interlinked}} <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> and the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area connects regional {{parks and}} visitor centers. The country's oldest public wildflower garden, the Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden and Bird Sanctuary, is located within Theodore Wirth Park. Wirth Park is shared with Golden Valley {{and is about}} 60% the size of Central Park in New York City. Site of the 53-foot (16m) Minnehaha Falls, Minnehaha Park {{is one of the}} city's oldest and most popular parks, receiving over 500,000 visitors each year. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow named Hiawatha's wife Minnehaha for the Minneapolis waterfall in The Song of Hiawatha, a bestselling and often-parodied 19th century poem.|$|E

5|$|Since Herrick and {{his brother}} began selling {{manipulated}} taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, can be found <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called The Jackalope. On {{the other side of}} the world, The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo. In 1986, James Abdnor, a senator from South Dakota, gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope (rabbit head with antlers) during a presidential campaign stop in Rapid City.|$|E
5|$|Some on-street {{track was}} laid {{in a special}} {{foundation}} with cobbled road surfacing designed to be sympathetic with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted {{on the sides of}} buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} the Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event (251.4Ma), a fungal spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period. However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess, the spike did not appear worldwide, and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>places</b> it did not fall on the Permian–Triassic boundary.|$|E
