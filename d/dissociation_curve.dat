5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} each {{hemoglobin}} molecule to carry oxygen is normally modified by altered blood pH or CO2, causing an altered oxygen–hemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve.</b> However, {{it can also}} be pathologically altered in, e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
2500|$|Methemoglobinemia is a {{condition}} caused by elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood. Methemoglobin {{is a form of}} hemoglobin that contains the ferric [...] form of iron. The affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an increased affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit. [...] This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated oxygen–hemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in red blood cells, tissue hypoxia may occur.|$|E

50|$|The oxygen <b>dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> for {{southern}} bluefin tunas show a reverse temperature effect between 10 and(-) 23 C, and temperature insensitivity between 23 and(-) 36 C. Reverse temperature shift might prevent premature oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin {{as it is}} warmed in rete mirabile. Root effect and a large Bohr factor were also observed at 23 C.|$|R
2500|$|Hyperventilation depletes {{the blood}} of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia), which causes {{respiratory}} alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve.</b> This results in a lower venous partial pressure of oxygen, which worsens hypoxia. A normally ventilated breath-hold usually breaks (from CO2) with over 90% saturation which is far from hypoxia. [...] Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but {{not as strong as}} the hypercapnic respiratory drive. This has been studied in altitude medicine, where hypoxia occurs without hypercapnia due to the low ambient pressure. The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training. These variations imply that predictive risk cannot be reliably estimated, but pre-dive hyperventilation carries definite risks.|$|E
5000|$|The oxygen-hemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve,</b> {{also called}} the oxyhemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> or oxygen <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> (ODC), is a curve that plots the {{proportion}} of hemoglobin in its saturated (oxygen-laden) form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis. This curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin <b>dissociation</b> <b>curve</b> relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called [...] "hemoglobin affinity for oxygen"; that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules into the fluid that surrounds it.|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} ANOVA {{analysis of}} the thermal dissociation of RNA hybridized to DNA microarrays was used to improve discrimination between two soil microbial communities. Following hybridization of in vitro transcribed 16 S rRNA derived from uncontaminated and 2, 4, 6 - trinitrotoluene contaminated soils to an oligonucleotide microarray containing group- and species-specific perfect match (PM) probes and mismatch (MM) variants, thermal dissociation was {{used to analyze the}} nucleic acid bound to each PM-MM probe set. Functional ANOVA of the <b>dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> generally discriminated PM-MM probe sets when Td values (temperature at 50 % probe-target dissociation) could not. Maximum discrimination for many PM and MM probes often occurred at temperatures greater than theTd.

50|$|Size {{consistency}} and size extensivity are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature, However, {{there are very}} important distinctions to be made between them.

For example, the Restricted Hartree-Fock model {{is not able to}} describe correctly the <b>dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> of H2 and therefore all post HF methods will fail in that matter (except FCI).

40|$|Erhualian and Landrace breeds {{are typical}} genetically obese and lean pigs, respectively. To compare the fecal methanogenic Archaeal {{community}} {{between these two}} pig breeds, fecal samples from different growth phase pigs were collected and used for PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with two primer pairs (344 fGC/ 519 r and 519 f/ 915 rGC) and real-time PCR analysis. Results showed that a better separation and higher quality of bands pattern were obtained in DGGE profiles using primers 344 fGC/ 519 r as compared with primers 519 f/ 915 rGC. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that the predominant methanogens in the feces of Erhualian and Landrace pigs belonged to Methanobrevibacter spp. and Methanosphaera spp. Real-time PCR analysis revealed {{that there was no}} significant difference in the numbers of fecal total methanogens between Erhualian and Landrace pigs; however, pig growth phase affected the numbers of 16 S rRNA genes of total methanogens and Methanobrevibacter smithii. <b>Dissociation</b> <b>curves</b> of methyl coenzyme-M reductase subunit A (mcrA) gene fragments amplified with real-time PCR showed all samples possessed a single peak at 82 °C, which might be associated with M. smithii.
