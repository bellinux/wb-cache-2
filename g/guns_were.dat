5|$|Bigger <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury {{became an}} {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, {{and were}} back in Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve, leaving Bretagne {{the only member of}} her class in service; while out of service, Provence {{underwent}} a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and was carried out in Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75mm M1897 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire control station and a rangefinder for the ship's anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added.|$|E

5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To compensate for the added weight, the ship's armored conning tower was removed.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable {{received}} a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun on a high-angle Mark II mount in March 1915. It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed {{at the same}} time.|$|E

5|$|Static dummy {{tanks and}} <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> made mainly of local {{materials}} including calico and palm-frond hurdles. Some dummy tanks were mobile, consisting of light frames placed over jeeps. A total of 500 dummy tanks and 150 dummy <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> constructed.|$|E
5|$|The eight 8-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{mounted in}} pairs in four wing turrets {{placed on the}} superstructure. Their arc of fire, {{although}} big on paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13-inch guns. The smaller 6-inch <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> mounted in twin wing casemates midships on the main deck level, with a 6-pounder in between. The other Hotchkiss 6-pounders lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the 1-pounders were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern {{of the ship and}} two more in the fighting tops of the masts. In 1908, all the 6-inch and most of the lighter <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery and because ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50-caliber single-purpose <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> added midships and in the fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size by the Royal Navy, while the waist <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> then {{dismantled}} {{and moved}} to {{the northern part of the}} eastern front, where an attack was planned on Leningrad. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> placed 30km (18.6mi) from the city near the railway station of Taizy. The <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fully operational when the attack <b>was</b> cancelled. The <b>gun</b> then spent the winter of 1942/43 near Leningrad.|$|R

5|$|The main <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} director and the rangefinder. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> aimed solely by eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} intended 12-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> exchanged for sixteen 4-in (102mm) QF Mk III guns {{early in the}} construction process. They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were {{not expected to be}} manned in a ship-to-ship engagement during daylight. During 1914–15 the turret roof <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

5|$|The ships' {{anti-aircraft}} batteries were {{revised and}} improved {{throughout the course}} of their careers. The original single-mounted 8.8cm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> replaced with twin mounts for the new 8.8 cm SK C/32 guns and a third twin mount was also installed, bringing the number of guns to six. Eight 3.7 cm SK C/30 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> installed in the mid-1930s and up to eight 2 cm Flak 30 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> also added. Köln, the only ship to survive {{to the end of the}} war, was ultimately armed with eight 3.7cm and eighteen 2cm guns, though provisions had been made to mount up to ten and twenty-four guns of the two calibers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{mounted in}} barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at the forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> on the upper deck, fore and aft of the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E

5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> given to the Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called {{for the use of}} these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
5|$|After World War II two of Frunzes turrets {{and their}} <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> used to rebuild Coast Defense Battery 30 (Maksim Gor'kii I) in Sevastopol. It {{remained}} in service with the Soviet Navy through 1997.|$|E
5|$|Asama made a {{training}} cruise in 1921 before her armament was modified in 1922. All of her main deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder <b>guns,</b> <b>were</b> removed and their casemates plated over. In addition {{all of her}} QF 2.5-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type AA gun was added. After the refit, she resumed her training cruises, generally at two-year intervals, until she ran aground in 1935. The damage to her bottom was severe enough that the IJN decided make her a stationary training ship in 1938.|$|E
