500|$|Shakira {{felt it was}} {{something}} she had not [...] "tapped into {{for the past three}} years," [...] and its inclusion in the album resulted in [...] "very intense, very romantic" [...] songs. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] is one such song from the album. The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar. According to Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily, its [...] "softer" [...] production helps in putting the focus on Shakira's voice, which she opined had been [...] "stripped to its sensitive core." [...] The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of [...] "longing, regrets and loneliness." [...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it's right there in the songs. I've decided that I'm not going to explain every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain me better than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>explain</b> them." ...|$|E

60|$|Upon recovering, {{my first}} impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of what I {{had seen and}} heard--and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>explain</b> what feeling of repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.|$|R

40|$|After {{defining}} U. I. as a symptom, {{sign and}} condition, the author claims, through epidemiological studies, that this reflects a major medical, {{social and economic}} problem. On the other hand the physiopathology of U. <b>I.</b> <b>can</b> be <b>explained</b> {{in a context of}} balance between the retention and emptying forces during the filling phase. Therefore the author explains U. I. as an urgency due to overactive bladder as well as hypermobility of the bladder neck and/or injury of the intrinsic sphincter. The diagnosis and severity of the different types of U. I. are based on clinical history, the pad test, the diurnal fictional record and the Q tip test. The abnormal continence factors are measured by the following tests: plain XR of the urinary system, urinoculture, urodynamic studies, transvaginal ultrasound. The treatment of U. <b>I.</b> <b>can</b> be <b>explained</b> by the physiopathology and exemplified with clinical cases in a systematic way. After defining U.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>explain</b> the {{feelings}} that filled my breast as I saw the schooner take her final plunge and sink beneath the waves.

25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> neither <b>explain</b> nor understand.

5000|$|The song, {{written by}} Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, is an uptempo dance-oriented synthpop track with Clarke's {{signature}} analogue sound and Bell's lyrics about breaking through any restrictions or stereotypes of what love should be. The lyrics allude subtly to Bell's desire for wider acceptance of homosexual couples, his pain {{evident from the}} opening lines [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> when there are few words <b>I</b> <b>can</b> choose/How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> when words get broken". The chorus is memorable for Bell's use of falsetto. The music video featured Clarke and Bell performing the song while being hoisted through the air by thick, metal chains.|$|R

[...] "I do {{not blame}} you for resenting {{what seems to be}} curiosity, but you must {{take my word for it}} that it is nothing of the sort. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> perhaps <b>explain</b> myself better by asking you still another sort of question.

60|$|With a {{buoyancy}} and hopefulness and a gaiety {{that hardly}} ever flagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me, principally because he mistook it, {{in such a}} very odd way, for prudence.

50|$|Mithridates I {{appeared}} to have died in c. 66 BC, as his relative Darius I was King of Media Atropatene in c. 65 BC.
