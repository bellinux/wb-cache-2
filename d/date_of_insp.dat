GTP[S] caused a shift to lower concentrations of Ca 2 + and also increased the maximal response. The effects of GTP[S] and Ca 2 + were synergistic. Although as much as 80 % <b>of</b> the <b>InsPs</b> were derived from phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PtdInsP) or 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2), the amount <b>of</b> <b>InsPs</b> produced could be several times {{the total amount of}} PtdInsP and PtdInsP 2 in the cells and was largely accounted for by a decrease in PtdIns. The levels of labelled PtdInsP and PtdInsP 2 increased on stimulation with Ca 2 +, but decreased on stimulation with GTP[S] or the combination of Ca 2 + and GTP[S]. Preincubation with Ca 2 + and ATP amplified the subsequent GTP[S]-induced production <b>of</b> <b>InsPs.</b> ATP and its gamma-thio and beta gamma-imido analogues stimulated the formation <b>of</b> <b>InsPs</b> in intact cells.

40|$|Prolonged {{stimulation}} of rat A 7 r 5 aortic smooth muscle cells with 3 microM vasopressin, or of hamster DDT 1 MF- 2 smooth muscle cells with 10 microM bradykinin or 100 microM histamine led within 4 h to a 40 - 50 % down-regulation {{of the type}} 1 InsP 3 receptor (InsP 3 R- 1) and of the type 3 InsP 3 receptor (InsP 3 R- 3). InsP 3 R down-regulation was a cell- and agonist-specific process, since several other agonists acting on PLC-coupled receptors did not change the expression level <b>of</b> the <b>InsP</b> 3 R isoforms in these cell types and since no agonist-induced down-regulation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 Rs was observed in HeLa cells. Down-regulation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 Rs was prevented by an inhibitor of proteasomal protease activity, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN). The Ca 2 + channel blocker verapamil (2 microM) also induced InsP 3 R- 1 down-regulation (43 %) in A 7 r 5 cells, which was inhibited by ALLN. In A 7 r 5 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct, bearing a luciferase coding sequence under control <b>of</b> the rat <b>InsP</b> 3 R- 1 promoter, reduced luciferase activity could be demonstrated upon {{stimulation of}} cells with vasopressin or verapamil. Thus, besides enhanced protein degradation, a reduction <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 R promoter activity might contribute to the down-regulation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 Rs in A 7 r 5 cells. We next investigated the effect <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 R down-regulation on Ca 2 + responses in A 7 r 5 cells. A rightward shift in the dose-response curve for InsP 3 -induced Ca 2 + release was observed in permeabilized monolayers of vasopressin-pretreated A 7 r 5 cells (EC 50 630 nM and 400 nM for pretreated and non-pretreated cells, respectively). The Ca 2 + responses to threshold doses of vasopressin were markedly reduced in intact vasopressin-pretreated cells. We conclude that prolonged agonist-exposure leads to down-regulation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 Rs in A 7 r 5 and DDT, MF- 2 smooth muscle cells. The mechanism of down-regulation likely involves proteasomal degradation and reduction <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 R promoter activity.

In the present study, Scatchard analysis <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 binding to cerebellum microsomes indicates that the effects of Ca 2 + and pH are exerted through changes in the apparent affinity of the receptor without effects on maximal binding. The influence of extravesicular Ca 2 + and pH on InsP 3 -mediated 45 Ca 2 + release was investigated. Extravesicular Ca 2 + inhibited InsP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + release.

By measuring unidirectional 45 Ca 2 + efflux from permeabilized rat hepatocytes, we demonstrate that such quantal responses to InsP 3 occur at all temperatures between 2 and 37 degrees C, but at much lower rates at the lower temperatures. Preincubation with submaximal concentrations <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3, which themselves evoked quantal Ca 2 + release, {{had no effect on}} the sensitivity of the stores to further additions <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3.

Such incremental responses and the persistence of quantal behaviour at 2 degrees C indicate that InsP 3 -evoked receptor inactivation is unlikely to be the cause of quantal Ca 2 + mobilization. Reducing the Ca 2 + content of the intracellular stores by up to 45 % did not affect their sensitivity to InsP 3, but substantially reduced the time taken for each submaximal InsP 3 concentration to exert its full effect. These results suggest that neither luminal nor cytosolic Ca 2 + regulation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 receptors are the determinants of quantal behaviour. Our results are not therefore consistent with incremental responses to InsP 3 depending on mechanisms involving attenuation <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 receptor function by cytosolic or luminal Ca 2 + or by InsP 3 binding itself.

40|$|Injection of {{inositol}} 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate (InsP 3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors causes {{an elevation}} of intracellular free Ca concentration (Cai) and depolarizes the photoreceptors.

However, sensitivity to further injections <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 remains suppressed for several tens of seconds. The possibility that the suppression of Ca release (feedback inhibition) is due to a small lingering elevation of Cai, below the existing detection limit of aequorin, was investigated by measuring Cai with Ca-sensitive electrodes. Double-barreled, Ca- selective microelectrodes were used to pressure inject InsP 3 and measure Cai at the same point. Light or InsP 3 injections into the light- sensitive compartment depolarized the photoreceptors and induced {{an elevation of}} Cai that persisted for tens of seconds. Injections <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 during the decay of Cai showed that sensitivity to InsP 3 recovered as resting Cai approached the prestimulus level. The relationship between elevated Cai and feedback inhibition was very steep. An elevation of Cai of 1 microM or more was associated with inhibitions of 79 +/- 12. 4 % (SEM; n = 7) for the InsP 3 -induced Cai increase and of 76 +/- 8 % for depolarizations. With a residual Cai elevation of 0. 01 microM or less, the mean inhibition was 10 +/- 7. 4 % for InsP 3 -induced Cai increase and 6. 6 +/- 4 % for InsP 3 -induced depolarization. Injections <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 into a light-insensitive compartment within the cell induced elevations of Cai with no associated depolarizations or feedback inhibition. To verify that a sustained elevation of Cai is necessary for inhibition <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3 -induced Cai increase and depolarization, we injected ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta- aminoethylether) -N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) between two injections <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 3.

In the absence of Ca 2 +, 125 I-labeled calmodulin reversibly bound to multiple sites on InsP 3 receptors and Ca 2 + increased the binding by 190 % Â± 10 %; the half-maximal effect occurred when the Ca 2 + concentration was 184 Â± 14 nM. In the absence of Ca 2 +, calmodulin caused a reversible, concentration-dependent (IC 50 = 3. 1 Â± 0. 2 Î¼M) inhibition of [3 H]InsP 3 binding by decreasing the affinity of the receptor for InsP 3. This effect was similar at all Ca 2 + concentrations, indicating that the site through which calmodulin inhibits InsP 3 binding has similar affinities for calmodulin and Ca 2 +-calmodulin.

An enhancement of LTP was not observed if a non-metabolizable inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) analogue (2, 3 -dideoxy- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, 100 Î¼M) was applied intracellularly. Current-voltage relations of NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs were not altered by InsP 4 application. The presence <b>of</b> <b>InsP</b> 4 was slightly effective in relieving a D-(â) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) -induced block of LTP. The peak current amplitude of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) was increased by InsP 4. Ï-Conotoxin GVIA inhibited the InsP 4 -induced LTP facilitation. These data indicate that InsP 4 can modify the extracellular Ca 2 + entry through upregulation of VGCCs, which may in turn contribute to the observed enhancement of LTP induced by InsP 4.

Both InsP 3 R 2 and InsP 3 R 3 are positively regulated by cytosolic ATP, but InsP 3 R 2 is 10 -fold more sensitive than InsP 3 R 3 to this form of modulation.
