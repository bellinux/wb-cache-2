This work directly supports the "Breakthrough Propulsion" objectives detailed in the NASA OCT TA 02 In-space Propulsion Roadmap, and aligns with the # 10 Top Technical Challenge identified in the report. Since the work being pursued by this laboratory is applied scientific research in the areas of the quantum vacuum, gravitation, nature of space-time, and other fundamental physical phenomenon, high fidelity testing facilities are needed. The lab will first implement a low-thrust torsion pendulum (< 1 uN), and commission the facility with an existing Quantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster. To date, the QVPT line of research has produced data suggesting very high specific <b>impulse</b> <b>coupled</b> with high specific force. If the physics and engineering models can be explored and understood in the lab to allow scaling to power levels pertinent for human spaceflight, 400 kW SEP human missions to Mars may become a possibility, and at power levels of 2 MW, 1 -year transit to Neptune may also be possible. Additionally, the lab is implementing a warp field interferometer that will be able to measure spacetime disturbances down to 150 nm. Recent work published by White [1] [2] [3] suggests that it may be possible to engineer spacetime creating conditions similar to what drives the expansion of the cosmos.

Compared to general (non-mutual) insurance models, which involve one-sided impulse control (i. e., either downside or upside impulse) of the underlying insurance reserve process that is required to be positive, a mutual insurance differs in allowing two-sided impulse control (i. e., both downside and upside <b>impulse),</b> <b>coupled</b> with the classical proportional control of reinsurance. We prove that a special band-type impulse control $(a,A,B,b) $ with $a= 0 $ and $a<A<B<b$, coupled with a proportional reinsurance policy (classical control), is optimal when {{the objective is to}} minimize the total maintenance cost. That is, when the reserve position reaches a lower boundary of $a= 0 $, the reserve should immediately be raised to level $A$; when the reserve reaches an upper boundary of $b$, it should immediately be reduced to a level $B$. An interesting finding produced by the study reported in this paper is that there exists a situation such that if the upside fixed cost is relatively large in comparison to a finite threshold, then the optimal band control is reduced to a downside only (i. e., dividend payment only) control in the form of $(0, 0;B,b) $ with $a=A= 0 $. In this case, it is optimal for the mutual insurance firm to go bankrupt as soon as its reserve level reaches zero, rather than to jump restart by calling for additional contingent funds. This finding partially explains why many mutual insurance companies, that were once quite popular in the financial markets, are either disappeared or converted to non-mutual ones...|$|R
5000|$|Because the magneto has {{low voltage}} output at low speed, {{starting}} an engine is more difficult.

The <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> uses a spring, a hub cam with flyweights, and a shell. The hub of the magneto rotates while the drive shaft is held stationary, and the spring tension builds up. When the magneto is supposed to fire, the flyweights are released {{by the action of}} the body contacting the trigger ramp. This allows the spring to unwind giving the rotating magnet a rapid rotation and letting the magneto spin at such a speed to produce a spark.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} general scheme for {{creating}} atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) {{such as the}} Rashba or Dresselhaus types using magnetic-field-gradient pulses. In contrast to conventional schemes based on adiabatic center-of-mass motion with atomic internal states restricted to a dressed-state subspace, our scheme works for the complete subspace of a hyperfine-spin manifold by utilizing the coupling between the atomic magnetic moment and external magnetic fields. A spatially dependent pulsed magnetic field acts as an internal-state-dependent <b>impulse,</b> thereby <b>coupling</b> the atomic internal spin with its orbital center-of-mass motion, as in the Einstein-de Haas effect. This effective coupling can be dynamically manipulated to synthesize SOC of any type (Rashba, Dresselhaus, or any linear combination thereof).

We verify the results with direct N-body simulations, and also compare them with the conventional straight path approximation. Heating on highly eccentric orbits dominates, as adiabatic corrections strictly prohibit energy changes on low eccentricity orbits. The results are illustrated for globular cluster NGC 6712. For the orbital eccentricities higher than 0. 9, the future lifetime of NGC 6712 is less than 10 10 yr.

According to strong explosion theory and an ideal gas model, a dimensionless factor indicating energy law of similitude is introduced, and formula of <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient is deducted. Then theoretical study of altitude characteristic is carried out and mechanism of altitude characteristic is further explained. The results indicate that there is a maximum value of <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient if the dimensionless factor equals to 0. 41 in theory, and whether the phenomena of maximum appear or not depends on the range of the dimensionless factor related to altitude. As to a conical nozzle with the fixed length of 120 mm, the relationship between the sonic velocity and the dimensionless factor causes the maximum phenomenon at the altitude of about 12. 5 km, and maximum theoretical <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient is also found in the experimental investigations.

Mission scenarios were analyzed for nanosatellite launch to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using a ground-based high energy laser as energy supply significantly optimizing the mass-to-payload-ratio. Experimental work {{was carried out}} using a home-made, electron-beam sustained CO 2 high energy laser in the 10 kW class with around 10 μs pulse length. The parabolic thruster was compared with the Lightcraft Technology Demonstrator in air-breathing mode {{as well as with}} Polyoxymethylene (POM) as an ablative propellant with respect to laser pulse energy and beam profile taking into account for standardization issues of ballistic pendula. Experiments showed good performance of pure air-breathing mode without propellant down to 200 mbar ambient pressure allowing for a drastic propellant reduction for the initial flight phase during dense atmosphere. The commonly used hydrodynamic point explosion model with a strong shock wave was analyzed with respect to the optimization of the <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient in geometric scaling by the adaptation of nozzle diameter and length to the range of the applied laser pulse energy. The usage of ablative propellants like POM, inevitable in the vacuum of space, yields enhancement of <b>impulse</b> <b>coupling</b> under atmospheric conditions which can partly be attributed to combustion. Various polymer-metal composites were developed and analyzed in order to achieve a higher specific impulse, but failed due to material inhomogeneity.

40|$|Impact {{happens when}} {{two or more}} bodies collide, {{generating}} very large impulsive forces {{in a very short}} period of time during which kinetic energy is first absorbed and then released after some loss. This paper introduces a state transition diagram to model a frictionless multibody collision. Each state describes a different topology of the collision characterized by the set of instantaneously active contacts. A change of state happens when a contact disappears at the end of restitution, or when a disappeared contact reappears as the relative motion of two bodies goes from separation into penetration. Within a state, (normal) <b>impulses</b> are <b>coupled</b> differentially subject to relative stiffnesses at the active contact points and the strain energies stored there. Such coupling may cause restart of compression from restitution during a single impact. Impulses grow along a bounded curve with first-order continuity, and converge during the state transitions.
