40|$|Abstract. We study Nash equilibria in {{the context}} of <b>flows</b> over <b>time.</b> Many results on static routing games have been {{obtained}} over the last ten years. In <b>flows</b> over <b>time</b> (also called dynamic flows), flow travels through a network over time and, as a consequence, flow values on edges are time-dependent. This more realistic setting has not been tackled from the viewpoint of algorithmic game theory yet; but there is a rich literature on game theoretic aspects of <b>flows</b> over <b>time</b> in the traffic community. We present a novel characterization of Nash equilibria for <b>flows</b> over <b>time.</b> It turns out that Nash <b>flows</b> over <b>time</b> {{can be seen as a}} concatena-tion of special static flows.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} parts-to-picker warehouses with remotely located order-picking workstations. More specifically, we deduce mathematical expressions for the order <b>flow</b> <b>times,</b> which are defined as the time between release and completion of a customer order in the warehouse. To this end, we model an order-picking workstation as a polling system so that order <b>flow</b> <b>times</b> correspond to cycle times in the polling system. The order-picking policy of each order picker handling one order {{at a time to}} avoid picking errors is captured by a specific service discipline, which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, has not been studied before. As this service discipline does not satisfy the so-called branching property, we establish stochastic bounds for the order <b>flow</b> <b>times.</b> These bounds are shown to be adequate and aid in setting targets for the throughput of the storage area, which, in turn, is the input rate of the workstations. As research on parts-to-picker warehouses has traditionally focused on optimizing operations in the storage area, we believe our results are complementary to those established in literature...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntrinsic {{to family}} based {{dispatching}} is the grouping of similar types {{of jobs in}} front of a machine for joint processing. Machine <b>flow</b> <b>times</b> may be improved in this way, as less time is spent on set-ups. Our observations in practice, however, suggest that family based dispatching may result in a bulky arrival pattern for successor manufacturing stages, thereby causing additional delay. So far, literature seems to neglect this effect. To explore this issue we develop queueing theoretical approximations of <b>flow</b> <b>times</b> for a simple two-stage shop. It appears that the optimal batch size for the shop is typically smaller than the optimal batch size for the batch machine. Furthermore, we propose extensions to existing dispatching rules by using information on successor stages. Existing and new extended rules are tested by an extensive simulation study. In line with the queueing theoretical analysis the outcomes indicate that exhaustive rules - assuming batch size to be equal to family queue length - are clearly outperformed by non-exhaustive rules - allowing for smaller batches. Moreover, results show that the inclusion of local information on successor stages in rule decision making improves shop <b>flow</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
