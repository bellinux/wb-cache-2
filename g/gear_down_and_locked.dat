50|$|The landing <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> at impact. There was no {{evidence}} of mechanical or structural failure prior to the impact.|$|R
50|$|Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 crashed while {{circling}} {{around the}} airport at Miami, on December 29, 1972, The Eastern crew became {{preoccupied with the}} nose gear indicator light problem and accidentally disconnected the autopilot, causing the aircraft to make a slow descent and crash into the Everglades. Further investigation revealed that the nose <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pilots {{confirming}} that their landing <b>gear</b> is <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> refer to [...] "three green" [...] or [...] "three in the green.", {{a reference to}} the electrical indicator lights (or painted panels of mechanical indicator units) from the nosewheel/tailwheel and the two main gears. Red lights indicate the gear is in the up-locked position; amber lights indicate that the landing gear is in transit (neither <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> nor fully retracted).|$|R
50|$|A {{free-fall}} or gravity drop {{system uses}} gravity to deploy the landing <b>gear</b> into the <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or mechanical handle in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then pulls the landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> deploys it. Once in position {{the landing gear}} is mechanically <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> safe to use for landing.|$|R
50|$|After about a 30-minute flight, it {{was time}} to land and Welch lowered the flaps and gear. At this point, the nose gear would not extend completely. For 40 minutes, Welch unsuccessfully tried {{everything}} to extend the nose gear. When he reached a low fuel state, he elected to land on Muroc Lake Bed without a fully extended nose gear. Upon touchdown, in a nose-high attitude, Welch cut the engine and as the XP-86 slowed the nose <b>gear</b> snapped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> The aircraft was undamaged.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 August 1978 - At San Antonio, the Metro II {{commuter}} {{plane was}} refueled {{in the right}} wing with 125 gallons. After an 18-minute flight, while approaching Austin, the left engine failed due to fuel starvation. Failing to assure if the landing <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> the crew continued their approach to runway 12R. After touchdown, the plane veered off the runway. It appeared that the crossflow valve had been off during the entire flight, thereby disabling fuel flow from the right wing tank to the fuel tank in the left wing.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{wing flaps}} {{are used to}} improve low speed flying {{characteristics}} and reduce landing and take-off speeds. The flaps are hydraulically operated. Interconnecting cables synchronize the flaps throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on the left flap sector prevents over-travel. An audible waning horn warns of flap extension to more than 25 degrees if the landing <b>gear</b> is not <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 28 July 1959, an East Anglian Flying Services Vickers 614 Viking 1 (registration G-AHPH) {{was written}} off at Southend Airport {{as a result}} of being damaged beyond repair in a landing {{accident}} {{at the end of a}} non-scheduled passenger flight. On approach to Southend, the aircraft's right-hand main gear indicator did not show [...] "green", thereby failing to confirm that the <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> The pilot in command of the aircraft attempted an emergency landing on the grass parallel to the runway after noticing that the emergency gear extension system was inoperable. Following touch-down, the right main gear collapsed and the aircraft swung to the right, damaging it beyond repair. None of the 39 occupants (three crew and 36 passengers) were injured.|$|R
50|$|Peterson {{fired the}} landing rockets to provide {{additional}} lift, but he hit the lake bed before the landing <b>gear</b> was fully <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> The M2-F2 rolled over six times, coming to rest upside down. Pulled from the vehicle by Jay King and Joseph Huxman, Peterson {{was rushed to the}} base hospital, transferred to the March Air Force Base Hospital and then the UCLA Hospital. He recovered but lost vision in his right eye due to a staphylococcal infection.|$|R
50|$|The {{crash was}} {{investigated}} by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. On 5 January 2012 a preliminary report was issued stating that the TSB listed the accident as a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). The report stated that two seconds prior to impact the crew began a go-around. At that time the crew had completed the landing checklist, the flaps were at 40, the aircraft was travelling at 157 kn and the landing <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> Both engines were in operation and producing power at the time. The aircraft had been following an ILS approach due to poor visibility, and post-crash investigation found the ILS system to be operating normally. In fact another aircraft landed 20 minutes after the crash of Flight 6560 using an ILS approach.|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Alianza Lima air {{disaster}} {{took place}} on 8 December 1987, when a Peruvian Navy Fokker F27-400M chartered by Peruvian football club Alianza Lima plunged into the Pacific Ocean six miles short of its destination, off the Ventanilla District {{of the city of}} Callao. On board the flight were a total of 44 players, managers, staff, team supporters, and crewmembers, of whom only the pilot survived the accident. The team was returning from a Peruvian league match in Pucallpa. Uncomfortable with the malfunctioning indicator on his control panel, the pilot requested a flyby of the control tower at Lima's Jorge Chávez International Airport so that spotters on the ground could confirm that the aircraft's landing <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> Upon receiving visual confirmation of safe configuration for landing, the aircraft went around for another attempt at a landing, during which the aircraft flew too low, hitting the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
2500|$|The DC-8 was {{following}} a Cessna 177 Cardinal, designated 67T, {{which was also}} conducting a back-course approach, flying at [...] All communication between SK933, 67T and air traffic control was occurring on the same frequency. Air-traffic control asked SK933 at 19:19:35 to reduce its speed further to take the Cessna into account, and the pilots reduced their speed to [...] This speed requires the full extension of the flaps, but this step was not carried out. The nose gear was showing an unsafe indication; should the flaps be extended fully without the nose <b>gear</b> <b>down,</b> a horn would blow, {{which could not be}} silenced without retracting the flaps. The captain recycled the gear, but the indicator light still showed an unsafe condition. Meanwhile, the first officer believed that the flaps were fully extended, and started reducing speed to [...] After the flight engineer confirmed that the nose <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> the captain fully extended the flaps.|$|R
50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} when the landing gear was lowered, a loud thump was heard. That unusual sound was accompanied by abnormal vibration and yaw of the aircraft. The right main landing gear retract cylinder assembly had failed due to corrosion, and that allowed the right gear to free fall. Although it was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> the rapid <b>and</b> abnormal free fall of the gear damaged a microswitch so severely that it failed to complete the circuit to the cockpit green light that tells the pilots that <b>gear</b> is <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> Those unusual indications (loud noise, vibration, yaw, and no green light) led the captain to abort the landing, {{so that they would}} have time to diagnose the problem and prepare the passengers for an emergency landing. While the decision to abort the landing was prudent, the accident occurred because the flight crew became so absorbed with diagnosing the problem that they failed to monitor their fuel state and calculate a time when they needed to return to land or risk fuel exhaustion.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{our experience}} with modeling {{the landing gear}} system of an aircraft using the formal specification language Fiacre. Our model {{takes into account the}} behavior and timing properties of both the physical parts and the control software of this system. We use this formal model to check safety and real-time properties on the system but also to find a safe bound on the maximal time needed for all <b>gears</b> to be <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> (assuming the absence of failures). Our approach ultimately relies on the model-checking tool Tina, that provides state-space generation and model-checking algorithms for an extension of Time Petri Nets with data and priorities...|$|R
25|$|The Spitfires {{with the}} {{single-stage}} Merlin engines used four different wing types, Type A, B, C and D wings, {{which had the}} same dimensions and plan but different internal arrangements of armament and fuel tanks. All Mk Is, IIs, and Vs and their derivatives had small, rectangular undercarriage indicator pins which projected at an angle from the upper wing surfaces when the undercarriage legs were locked down, providing a positive mechanical indication that the landing <b>gears</b> were indeed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> since the pilot {{could not see the}} landing gear for himself. These were a backup to the indicator lights on the instrument panel, in case the lights malfunctioned or failed. All of these variants used Dunlop AH2061 tyres, mounted on alloy mainwheels which had five openings. The fixed, castering tailwheels used Dunlop AH2184 tyres.|$|R
5000|$|The aircraft, {{carrying}} sixteen footballers, five coaching staff, four directors, eight cheerleaders, three referees, two Navy personnel, and six crewmembers, {{took off}} from FAP Captain David Abenzur Rengifo International Airport in Pucallpa at 6:30 in the afternoon. As the pilots began their descent into Lima, they noticed {{that they could not}} confirm that the Fokker's landing <b>gear</b> was <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b> The aircraft requested a flyby of the control tower at Jorge Chavez airport so that observers on the ground could confirm that the wheels were down. The observers confirmed that the airplane was configured for landing; at the aircraft mechanic's go-ahead, the pilot brought the aircraft around for another attempt at a landing. The aircraft flew too low over the water and the right wing struck the surface of the ocean as the aircraft was lining up with the runway, 6.9 mi northwest of the airport. At 8:05 PM, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft and a state of emergency was declared, but search and rescue teams couldn't respond as all the rescue vehicles were out of fuel, due to corrupt officers selling the daily quota on the black market. The search for survivors started in the morning of the next day. As soon as the pilot of the aircraft, Edilberto Villar, was found, the search and rescue teams started to give up on looking {{for the rest of the}} passengers ...|$|R

50|$|Two {{hours into}} the flight, air traffic control at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport told flight 715 to start its {{approach}} and land on runway 15. The flight crew started their approach, putting the landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> extending the flaps. The aircraft descended below MDA of 750 feet, then at 300 feet it crashed {{into the side of}} a hill 4 miles from the airport, near an estate called Ladang Elmina.

50|$|At 19:57, Funchal {{cleared the}} crew to descend to 3500 ft and {{informed}} them that the QNH was 1014.0 mb. Apparently, during the landing checklist, the crew forgot to set the altimeter to that value, and proceeded to the final 180° turn to the downwind leg well below the correct altitude, losing sight of the runway lights. Relying only on instruments, the pilot descended below the 720 ft required during circling and reached the base leg below 200 ft, impacting the sea soon after that. At the time of impact, the altimeter was reading 500 ft. The aircraft had its landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the flaps were extended at 20 degrees.|$|R
60|$|The Steam whistled {{warnings}} as he {{went about}} his business: {{it is in this}} short, quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea that most of the accidents happen, for then everything thinks that the worst is over and goes off guard.

50|$|See {{completed}} a full circle {{to the left}} {{at an altitude of}} 500 to 600 ft, and announced his intention to land on the southwest runway (24). With landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> full flaps, the plane dropped quickly but too far left of the runway. See turned on his afterburner to increase power while pulling up and turning hard right. Seconds later, at 8:58 a.m. CST, the plane struck the roof of McDonnell Building 101 on the northeast side of the airport. It lost its right wing and landing gear on impact, then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond the building which was in use as a construction staging area.|$|R
5000|$|The Dreger Clock has {{a number}} of unusual {{characteristics}} in regard to its internal movements. First of all, the clock is powered and regulated by a simple 110 V electrical motor. There is no pendulum in the clock, as there is in other large street clocks such as the Jessop's Clock. The movement of the clock is simple yet effective. Mechanical power is distributed to each clock face from the central location of the motor, <b>and</b> <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> transferred to the various displays on the clock's three display faces. The international face of the clock uses what amounts to a bicycle chain drive to transfer mechanical power to each of the smaller international city clocks.|$|R
