25|$|Gwalior is {{also known}} for not {{participating}} in the 1857 rebellion, mainly due to non-co-operation with Rani Lakshmibai. After Kalpi (Jhansi) fell {{into the hands of}} the British on 24May 1858, Lakshmibai sought shelter at Gwalior Fort. The Maharaja of Gwalior was not willing to give up his fort without a fight as he was a strong ally of the British, but after negotiations, his troops capitulated and the rebels took possession of the fort. The British attacked Gwalior <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>time,</b> the battle was fought by Lakshmibai. Indian forces numbered around 20,000, and British forces around 1600 assisted by Maharaja of Gwalior troops. Lakshmibai's example is remembered to this day by Indian nationalists. She died fighting, and Gwalior was free from rebels. There is a statue of Lakshmibai on her horse which commemorates her contribution to the fight for independence. Tatya Tope and Rao Sahib escaped. Tatya Tope was later captured and hanged in April 1859.|$|E
25|$|The music {{style of}} the first records was a mixture between {{alternative}} rock, new wave and ethno jazz music. But there was an unexpected 'factor' that finally took the lead and cast its mighty shadow over the other songs: a musical joke which Valdobrev created together with friend and colleague Kamen Donev {{on their way back}} from a theatre tour in Vienna. Tired of the long and boring trip they took a bunch of keys for percussion and started rapping over a three chord country-like gypsy tune I love you, my dear. Back in Sofia they recorded the song in less than an hour, adding the characteristic voice of their colleague, the young actress Maya Bejanska. Although this ditty was totally different from anything in the album, it was so catchy that the producers decided to release it as a single. <b>In</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> it became vastly popular and later gave its name to the album that sold over 130,000 copies. This success almost obliged Stefan, Kamen and Maya to repeat this direction. And in 1996 they joined for a single project – an album called Revolution. It was based on folklore and gypsy songs and used many ethno instruments and elements in a rock context. Meanwhile, in 1995 Valdobrev released a collection of his scores for theatre performances called A Night at the Theatre.|$|E

Peter Marks of The New York Times noted the show's use of adult humor and pop culture references, declaring it [...] "the sort of playful satire that can appeal as much to a viewer of 37 as 7." [...] Joly Herman of Common Sense Media describes the show as a [...] "cute, highly stylized series thrills the senses with its strange characters, funny situations, and lots of lowbrow humor". She goes on to say, however, that the show does go from innocent to violent <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{and that there is}} not much protecting young viewers against the violent undertones.

It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>time.</b> It was effortless.

The sample prefaced the album's [...] "small-globe statement", Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had [...] "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from Consequence of Sound believed the speech introduced [...] "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to Washington Post critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the Obama-era zeitgeist and accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s Bedford–Stuyvesant setting of [...] "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for [...] "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such as a Black man being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality".
