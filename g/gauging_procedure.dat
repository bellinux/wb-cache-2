40|$|In this {{research}} Newton's old theory of gravity is rederived using an algebraic approach {{known as the}} <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure.</b> The resulting theory is Newton's theory in the mathematical language of Einstein's General Relativity theory, in which gravity is spacetime curvature. The <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure</b> sheds new light on Newton's theory en makes extensions of the theory easier to obtain. These extensions are stringy applications and an extension with a symmetry we hope {{to find in the}} LHC: supersymmetry. These extensions can be used for the so-called holographic principle, in which a theory of quantum gravity is described by a quantum field theory in one spatial dimension less...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The G/G WZW model {{results from}} the WZW-model by a {{standard}} procedure of gauging. G/G WZW models are members of Dirac sigma models, which also contain twisted Poisson sigma models as other examples. We show how the general class of Dirac sigma models {{can be obtained from}} a <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure</b> adapted to Lie algebroids {{in the form of an}} equivariantly closed extension. The rigid gauge groups are generically infinite dimensional and a standard <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure</b> would give a likewise infinite number of 1 -form gauge fields; the proposed construction yields the requested finite number of them. Although physics terminology is used, the presentation is kept accessible also for a mathematical audience...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a {{variation}} of the <b>gauge</b> <b>procedure</b> which employs a scalar gauge field, B (x), in addition to the usual vector gauge field, A μ (x). We study this variant of the usual <b>gauge</b> <b>procedure</b> {{in the context of a}} complex scalar, matter field ϕ (x) with a U(1) symmetry. We will focus most on the case when ϕ develops a vacuum expectation value via spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that under these conditions the scalar gauge field mixes with the Goldstone boson that arises from the breaking of a global symmetry. Some other interesting features of this scalar gauge model are: (i) The new <b>gauge</b> <b>procedure</b> gives rise to terms which violate C and CP symmetries. This may have have applications in cosmology or for CP violation in particle physics; (ii) the existence of mass terms in the Lagrangian which respect the new extended gauge symmetry. Thus one can have gauge field mass terms even in the absence of the usual Higgs mechanism; (iii) the emergence of a sine-Gordon potential for the scalar gauge field; (iv) a natural, axion-like suppression of the interaction strength of the scalar gauge boson...|$|R

40|$|Starting from mirror pairs {{consisting}} only {{of linear}} (framed A-type) quivers, we demonstrate that a wide class of three-dimensional quiver gauge theories with N = 4 supersymmetry and their mirror duals {{can be obtained}} by suitably gauging flavor symmetries. Infinite families of mirror pairs including various quivers of D and E -type and their affine extensions, star-shaped quivers, and quivers with symplectic gauge groups may be generated in this fashion. We present two different computational strategies to perform the aforementioned <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure</b> — one of them involves N = 2 * classical parameter space description, while the other one uses partition functions of the N = 4 theories on S 3. The partition function, in particular, turns out to be an extremely efficient tool for implementing this <b>gauging</b> <b>procedure</b> as it readily generalizes to arbitrary size of the quiver and arbitrary rank of the gauge group at each node. For most examples of mirror pairs obtained via this procedure, we perform additional checks of mirror symmetry using the Hilbert series...|$|E

In particular, recent works have proposed to use MPS (and higher dimensional tensor networks) for the study of systems with local symmetry that appear in the context of gauge theories.
