5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the <b>in-air</b> environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E

25|$|Berthold {{believed}} that squadron performance was declining {{because of lack}} of <b>in-air</b> leadership. In early August, he returned to his old training facility in Grossenhain and wangled a medical clearance from its doctor. Berthold returned to his unit to await the paperwork, to discover that he was being transferred to command Jagdstaffel 18 in Harelbeke, Belgium on 12 August. On 18 August, Berthold was finally certified to resume flying. Two days later, {{he was one of the}} aviation troops being reviewed by the Kaiser at Courtrai.|$|E
25|$|Many TV tuner/capture cards include remote {{controls}} {{for use with}} the applications included with the card. Software such as Boxee, GB-PVR, SageTV, MediaPortal and Beyond TV {{support the use of}} Windows MCE and other {{remote controls}}. Another option is an <b>in-air</b> mouse pointer like the Wii Remote, GlideTV Navigator, or Loop Pointer which gives cursor control from a distance. It is also possible to utilize common wireless keyboards and other peripherals to achieve the same effect (though the range may not be as long as a typical remote control's).|$|E
25|$|During Advanced Skills Training Combat Controllers (along with PJs and SOWT) attend {{two more}} {{advanced}} courses. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona for five weeks. The course instructs free fall parachuting procedures. It also provides wind tunnel training, <b>in-air</b> instruction focusing on student stability, aerial maneuvers, air sense, parachute opening procedures and parachute canopy control. They also attend Air Force Combat Diver School which is hosted at the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida. Combat Diver School is six weeks long. After completion of Combat Diver School trainees become combat divers, {{learning to use}} scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas. The course provides training to depths of 130feet, stressing development of maximum underwater mobility under various operating conditions. A class of CCTs and PJs at the Air Force Combat Diver School was covered by Discovery Channel's program Surviving the Cut during season two, which originally aired 25 July 2011.|$|E

500|$|It was {{the first}} episode to be filmed on {{location}} during season three, but the production only moved from the Paramount Studios lot to the Universal Studios backlot where the Western town set [...] "Six Points Texas" [...] was used. The shoot there started {{on the second day}} of filming over five days and utilized a number of sets including the main street, livery stable, saloon and schoolhouse. The sets have been used to film more movies than any other set in the world; the livery stable in particular was used in the 1940 film My Little Chickadee. A shuttlepod set-piece was brought from Paramount Studios and was used for filming scenes after it had landed, while <b>in-air</b> shots were added with special effects after filming was completed.|$|E

2500|$|The patent {{application}} Toulmin drew up gave the Wrights sole {{claim to the}} only system ever devised for the <b>in-air</b> control of a fixed-wing flying machine.

[...] The U.S. patent issued in 1906. Toulmin's fee for filing the multi-country patent was amazingly only $15.00.|$|E
2500|$|Valiant Shield {{included}} Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard units. [...] Air operations included {{thousands of}} sorties {{as well as}} <b>in-air</b> refuelings and parachute deployments. [...] Aircraft from Valiant Shield deployed on missions ranging across the Pacific {{all the way to}} Alaska. [...] Ships simulated anti-submarine warfare. Valiant Shield 2006 {{was the first time that}} three carrier strike groups had operated together in the Pacific in over ten years. Forces exercised a wide range of skills, including maritime interdiction; defense counter-air; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and command and control.|$|E
2500|$|Toulmin {{urged that}} the Wrights not seek {{a patent on}} their {{aircraft}} but only on its system for <b>in-air</b> control. [...] They followed his recommendation that they apply for a patent based on the three-axis control system of their 1902 Glider instead of their powered 1903 or 1904 Flyers {{in order to avoid}} having to present a working model to a highly doubting Patent Office. [...] In addition, Toulmin advised the Wrights to patent not just the mechanisms that allowed them to warp or flex a wing but, more importantly, to patent the idea of roll control itself.|$|E
2500|$|Sonar (originally {{an acronym}} for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a {{technique}} that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or {{under the surface of}} the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name [...] "sonar": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of [...] "targets" [...] in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking <b>in-air</b> sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.|$|E

Surveillance radars operate to support air and surface safety.|$|E

50|$|As {{the names}} imply, freefall sorters inspect product <b>in-air</b> during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters {{stabilize}} product on a chute prior to <b>in-air</b> inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are {{a lower price}} point, smaller footprint {{and the absence of}} moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.|$|E
