50|$|An <b>excise</b> <b>stamp</b> {{is a type}} {{of revenue}} stamp affixed to some exciseable goods to {{indicate}} that the required excise tax has been paid by the manufacturer. They are securities printed by the finance ministry of the relevant country.|$|E
5000|$|Excise stamps {{are most}} {{commonly}} found on tobacco and alcohol products, which reach the consumer in neatly packaged units (namely packets and bottles) {{to which the}} adhesive stamp is easily affixed. Since counterfeit alcohol and cigarettes are extremely common in many countries, {{the presence of a}} genuine <b>excise</b> <b>stamp</b> also goes some way towards guaranteeing the genuineness of the product, as only certified producers may legally buy excise stamps. (However, illegally obtained or counterfeit stamps are common in some countries.) ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Excise</b> <b>stamps</b> of Russia are {{a kind of}} Russian revenue stamps. They {{were issued}} {{according}} to the governmental order of the Russian Federation. On 14 April 1994 they adopted resolution number 319 [...] "Introduction of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> in the Russian Federation". Certain goods produced in Russia or imported to the territory of Russia are subject to excise tax including: ...|$|R
5000|$|On 24 October 1996, {{there was}} another decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, [...] "On {{approval}} of the production, storage and sale of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> and marking of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, and the sale or destruction of the confiscated alcoholic beverages and tobacco products". It introduced <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> into circulation in Ukraine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, the [...] "Customs Free Airport Act" [...] {{established}} Shannon as the world's first duty-free airport, a move {{promoted by}} Brendan O'Regan; although [...] "duty-free" [...] shopping is not applicable any more for flights within the European Union, EU-bound passengers can still buy goods, but {{have to pay}} the normal taxes. Shannon became a model for other duty-free facilities worldwide. For most goods, passengers can buy the same goods regardless of their destination: the only difference will be made in charging VAT at check-out. An exception to this are tobacco products, as all tobacco products sold in Ireland need to have an <b>excise</b> <b>stamp,</b> while this does not apply for [...] "real" [...] duty-free tobacco. As the prices for tobacco in Ireland are {{among the highest in the}} world, there is little or no demand for tobacco at Irish airports for EU flights.|$|E
50|$|Around 1905, {{a set of}} {{cigarette}} <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> were issued, and these are rare as they were usually torn upon use.|$|R

50|$|In 1820 Donkin {{worked with}} Sir William Congreve on {{preventing}} the forgery of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps,</b> using {{a method of}} two-colour printing with compound printing plates. Working with his partner John Wilks, he produced a machine which {{was used for the}} <b>Excise</b> and <b>Stamp</b> Office and also for the East India Company at Calcutta. This Rose Engine is now at the Science Museum, London.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{will buy}} a certain {{quantity}} of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> {{from the government}} at their excise value which they are then obliged to affix to every packet of cigarettes or bottle of spirits produced. The <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> are ideally affixed with strong glue over the cap of a bottle or across the lid of a box of cigarettes (and underneath the plastic/foil wrapper on the bottleneck or the cellophane of the cigarette-box) {{in such a way}} that they are destroyed when the product is opened. This is so that they cannot be reused, since this would constitute contraband.|$|R

These exist with various roulettes, perforations and combinations of both.|$|R

50|$|<b>Excise</b> <b>stamps</b> {{are often}} as {{detailed}} in their design as banknotes - usually {{made from the}} same type of paper and containing holograms and other anti-counterfeit devices. The reason for such measures is that excise duty is extremely expensive, in most EU countries accounting for around half the market price of the product.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> are required, all cigarettes and alcohol produced legally will bear a stamp. Some countries have separate stamps for -produced and imported excisable goods; others require separate stamps for products destined for duty-free sale, {{which are still}} subject to excise but not VAT; some countries do not require stamps for wines, while others do.|$|R
50|$|An {{excise duty}} is often applied by the {{affixation}} of revenue stamps to the products being sold.

The Uganda Revenue Authority issues various <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> to pay the tax on cigarettes up to this day.|$|R
50|$|In many countries, {{tobacco and}} alcohol are taxed {{by the use}} of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps.</b> For instance, the {{producer}} may buy stamps from the government which are then affixed to each bottle of alcohol or packet of cigarettes to show that tax has been paid. Often the stamp will be fixed across a seal so that on opening the pack or bottle the stamp is destroyed.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 or 1954 a numeral design simply inscribed RHODESIA AND NYASALAND REVENUE and {{the value}} was issued. Nine values were issued in all, ranging from 6d to £5. None of these are common, and the high values are {{particularly}} scarce. In 1955, the Federation issued three <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> for use on cigarette packets. These are quite rare as they were usually torn when used.|$|R
50|$|The various {{coats of}} arms appear on passports, <b>excise</b> <b>stamps,</b> {{official}} documents {{and various other}} uses.

Coats of arms were featured various times on Maltese postage stamps as well.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 the {{enterprise}} launched {{the production of}} Ukrainian driving licenses and transport registration certificates on plastic. These documents are protected with a holographic overlay produced by SE Holography. Testing carried out throughout the year of 2006 by SE Holography, together with Ukrainian scientists, yielded positive results that were used for making a brand new base for holography security elements with covert tags to upgrade the security of <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> on alcohol and tobacco.|$|R
25|$|Malta {{has used}} <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> {{to pay for}} the tax on {{cigarettes}} since at least the 1930s. Early issues consisted of long strips which depicted the British coat of arms and were inscribed EXCISE DUTY in English and DAZJU in Maltese. A smaller design was issued for imported cigarettes. Long strips with a plain design without any ornamentation were introduced in the 1950s, while designs depicting a mural crown and a Maltese cross were issued after independence in 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>Excise</b> duty <b>stamps</b> {{to pay the}} tax {{on alcohol}} have been in use since around 2008.

Later that year, paper strips and circular labels inscribed MT EXCISE were issued.|$|R
25|$|Malta {{also used}} {{impressed}} duty stamps from the 1920s until these {{were replaced by}} pre-printed revenues in the 1970s. The latter were discontinued in the early 1990s. Malta also had specific stamps for the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance (1929–56), passport fees (1933–72), National Insurance (1956–76) and Airport Charge (1975–88). <b>Excise</b> <b>stamps</b> {{have been used to}} pay the tax on cigarettes since the 1930s, the tax on spirits since the 2000s, and the tax on wine since 2015.

5000|$|In the UK, <b>excise</b> <b>stamps</b> {{have been}} in use for spirits since 2006.(view image) While these are usually printed on the back label of the bottle by the {{manufacturer}} rather than being a special security bought from the government, {{they still have to}} adhere to strict specifications, such as containing UV-visible inks. UK law does not require such physical stamps for cigarettes, either - instead, the words [...] "UK Duty Paid" [...] are printed in bold on all packs as part of the manufacturing process, while other forms of control are implemented by HM Revenue & Customs to verify that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, foreign-bought cigarette packets bearing revenue stamps can be widely seen across the UK, mainly due to the comparatively high price of British cigarettes, leading people to (often illegally) import them from abroad.|$|R
50|$|Mighty Corporation is also {{alleged to}} use fake tax stamps on {{cigarette}} packs, after Bureau of Customs conducted raids and confiscated cigarette packs alleged to use fake <b>excise</b> tax <b>stamps</b> on a warehouse in San Simon, Pampanga in March 2017, but Mighty deny the allegations, {{stating that the}} confiscated cigarettes rather use officially issued tax stamps.|$|R
