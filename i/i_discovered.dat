5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E

25|$|I {{had been}} having some {{difficulty}} with the relief committee of the Denver smelter men. At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that I had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the wives of the smelter men began to complain {{that they were not}} getting enough to eat. Years later, when his letters were published in The Pinkerton Labor Spy, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that the chairman of the relief committe (sic) was a Pinkerton detective, who was carrying out the instructions of the agency...|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> a {{dark and}} hairy {{creature}} on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} Sci Fi Wire {{what kind of}} {{challenges}} he faced while writing the book, Paolini said {{it was trying to}} avoid any references to modern items or actions. Brisingr takes place long before the industrial revolution, which Paolini said [...] "limits not only the things my characters use and do, but it also informs their worldview. This constraint extends to more recent words and phrases as well. For example, in Brisingr, I was going to use the description [...] When I researched its origins, however, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that it was coined to describe modern cooking: a short-order cook." ...|$|E

Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce.

500|$|Ken Tucker {{summarized}} Hartman's comedic style: [...] "He could momentarily fool audiences {{into thinking}} he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." [...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{has made}} sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, {{philosophers}} of the Scottish Enlightenment, which {{stand in the}} Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot {{over the edge of}} the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E

[...] Lupton compares Angelou's informal education described in this book with the education of other Black writers of the 20th century. [...] Like writers such as Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, and James Baldwin, Angelou did not earn a college degree and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". She {{did not feel that}} her education ended at high school, however. [...] As Hagen points out, since Angelou was encouraged to appreciate literature as a young child, she continues to read, exposing herself {{to a wide variety of}} authors, ranging from Countee Cullen's poetry to Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors. She states, during her stint as a madame, [...] "when my life hinged melodramatically on intrigue and deceit, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> the Russian writers".|$|E
500|$|Grant {{retired from}} the screen at 62, when his {{daughter}} Jennifer was born, to focus on bringing her up {{and to provide a}} sense of permanency and stability in her life. He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s, rarely finding a script that he approved of. He remarked: [...] "I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or a bum, but <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> more important things in life". Grant knew after he had made Charade that the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of Hollywood was now over. He expressed little interest in making a career comeback, and continued to respond to invites or mention of it with [...] "fat chance". He did, however, briefly appear in the video documentary for Elvis's 1970 Las Vegas concert , in the audience. When he was gifted with the negatives from a number of his films in the 1970s, Grant sold them to television for a sum of over two million dollars in 1975.|$|E

He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight.
