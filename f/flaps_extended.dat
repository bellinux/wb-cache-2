25|$|On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing {{design for}} high {{aerodynamic}} lift used two jet engines that blew high-velocity airstreams over the inboard {{section of the}} wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection <b>flaps</b> <b>extended</b> rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Cessna 206H is {{certified}} as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. [...] This {{is due to}} concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> [...] Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; {{it was a hot}} summer day). [...] A switch was added to the flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. [...] The other {{part of the problem is}} that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about [...] ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door.|$|E
2500|$|Hall and Anderson both {{survived the}} accident. Hall {{received}} burns {{on his arms}} and hands, and Anderson received burns on his face, arm and neck. Munson suffered a broken neck and would have most likely suffered from quadriplegia had he lived. Munson died of asphyxiation due to the inhalation of superheated air and toxic substances. The NTSB investigation into the crash stated that the probable cause was [...] "...the pilot's failure to recognize the need for, and {{to take action to}} maintain, sufficient airspeed to prevent a stall into the ground during an attempted landing. The pilot also failed to recognize the need for timely and sufficient power application to prevent the stall during an approach conducted inadvertently without <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> Contributing to the pilot's inability to recognize the problem and to take proper action was his failure to use the appropriate checklist and his nonstandard pattern procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile." ...|$|E

50|$|Airspeed {{indicators}} in many Light and Recreational aircraft {{can only}} show the pilot Indicated Airspeed (IAS). For True Airspeed (TAS) other components {{would have to}} be added by the manufacturer. Airspeed Indicator markings use a set of standardized coloured bands and lines {{on the face of the}} instrument. The white range is the normal range of operating speeds for the aircraft with the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended</b> as for landing or takeoff. The green range is the normal range of operating speeds for the aircraft without <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> The yellow range is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air, and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement.|$|E
50|$|An {{innovative}} {{feature of}} the wing arrangement was that the flaps {{could also be used}} as ailerons in a configuration akin to a flaperon. The flap area was one third of the total wing area and the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended</b> along {{the entire length of the}} wing. A lever controlled the flap action and through a different configuration it could change to aileron control mode.|$|E
50|$|After World War I, the augmenting {{traffic load}} {{combined}} with {{the increasing number of}} ships expected to follow the inauguration of the canal south of Södermalm, made it obvious the low bridge was soon to become insufficient. In 1925 it was subsequently decided a new elevated bridge should be built east of the old, thus extending Långholmsgatan over the strait.

5000|$|Descent : The descent {{during the}} final leg is {{typically}} flown at 1.3 times the stall speed of the aircraft, and usually with the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> Large [...] "airline" [...] (transport) type aircraft, are flown on a 3 degree slope or glidepath. Smaller light aircraft will typically be flown on a 4 to 6 degree glidepath. Typical power settings are 3/4 full power. The rate of descent typically ranges from approximately 300 ft/min (100 m/min) for light aircraft to 700 ft/min (200 m/min) for transport category.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{diagram of}} the use of slats and flaps to {{increase}} the maximum lift coefficient of an airfloil. The extra lift coefficient is caused by the Coandă effect as the air is diverted through the openings in the wings caused by the extended slats and <b>flaps.</b> <b>Extended</b> slats and flaps are used on commercial aircraft on landing and taking off; but are also used to great effect on fighter aircraft to allow slow airspeeds when necessary. This is not an engineering drawing, but a somewhat exaggerated diagram to emphasize the major points.|$|E
5000|$|Here, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} {{increasing}} the area (S) and lift coefficient (...) allow a similar amount of lift to be generated at a lower airspeed (V).Extending the flaps also increases the drag coefficient of the aircraft. Therefore, for any given weight and airspeed, flaps increase the drag force. Flaps increase the drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> Some flaps increase the wing area and, for any given speed, this also increases the parasitic drag component of total drag.|$|E

30|$|During the transfacial {{dissection}} approach, the dissection proceeds {{along the}} deep {{part of the}} transfacial layer {{so as not to}} damage the frontal branch. In {{the lower part of the}} preauricular region, the dissection is performed like a facial lifting along the parotidial-masseteric fascia. The incision is usually similar to the radical neck dissection incision, connecting the mastoid process and the hyoid bone. The dissection of the scalp <b>flap</b> <b>extends</b> to the superior orbital rim along the subpericranial plane. The cheek area extends to the parotid gland, and the subclavian incision is usually sufficient for the mental foramen.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was still too}} high and close in to land when it circled back to the airport. It was forced to continue circling Amsterdam until it could reduce altitude to that required for a final approach to landing. During the second circle, the wing flaps were extended. The inboard trailing edge <b>flaps</b> <b>extended,</b> since they were powered by the number one hydraulic system, which was still functioning, but the outboard trailing edge flaps did not extend, because they were powered by the number four hydraulic system, which failed when the number four engine {{broke away from the}} wing. The partial flap condition meant that the aircraft would have a higher pitch attitude than normal as it slowed down. The leading edge <b>flaps</b> <b>extended</b> on the left wing, but not on the right wing, because of the extensive damage sustained when the engines separated, which had also severely disrupted the air flow over the right wing. That differential configuration caused the left wing to generate significantly more lift than the damaged right wing, especially when the pitch altitude increased as the airspeed decreased. The increased lift on the left side increased the tendency to roll further to the right, both because the right outboard aileron was inoperative and because the thrust of the left engines was increased in an attempt to reduce the aircraft's very high sink rate. As the aircraft slowed, the ability of the remaining controls to counteract the right roll diminished. The crew finally lost all ability to prevent the aircraft from rolling to the right. The roll reached 90 degrees just before the impact with the apartment houses.|$|E
5000|$|These {{last three}} designs changed the wing {{geometry}} by extending the wing rearwards {{at right angles}} to the trailing edge. Akaflieg Darmstadt took a different approach, pivoting the single piece flap near the tip and sliding it out from within the wing trailing edge, gaining the mechanism the nickname [...] "penknife wing". As it is extended, a track in the fuselage side guides the thin flap into its high camber position at the wing root. The wing area is increased by 21% with the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended.</b> Although this arrangement avoids the vortexes at the flap tip, like any area increasing method used on a fixed span wing it results in a lower aspect ratio and hence a lower lift to drag ratio.|$|E

From an altitude of 16000 ft and with the <b>flaps</b> <b>extended</b> 8°, the aircraft entered a stable stall with it descending at a high rate in a horizontal attitude, eventually striking the ground with very little forward speed. The aircraft broke up on impact at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, a small village in southern Wiltshire and caught fire, killing all seven crew on board.|$|E
50|$|A redline mark {{indicates}} VNE, or velocity (never exceed). This is {{the maximum}} demonstrated safe airspeed that the aircraft must not exceed under any circumstances. The red line is {{preceded by a}} yellow band which is the caution area, which runs from VNO (maximum structural cruise speed) to VNE. A green band runs from VS1 to VNO. VS1 is the stall speed with flaps and landing gear retracted.
