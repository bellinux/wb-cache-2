2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering King's work. Shortly after King's death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (The Arrangement) (1969) which was about to begin production in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. [...] "I felt I'd better go find out where it is; {{what it is to be}} black in this country; what this rage is all about," [...] Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show Joey Bishop Show. In A's Biography episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states, [...] "I'll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he kept walking and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot." ...|$|E

60|$|And I {{put down}} my pen and left her. Left her? No: {{she would not}} be left: {{powerless}} to detain me, she rose and followed, close as my shadow. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last step of the stair.|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. I didn't {{shake hands}} with him: he shook hands with me. Could <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man in his own house, before his own wife, with his money in my pocket and in yours, and throw his civility back in his face? ...|$|R
50|$|At first Vova behaves {{well but}} then he {{suddenly}} begins to make a nuisance of himself, including tearing up I's wife's copy {{of the works of}} Marcel Proust. I and his wife go to live in another room and Vova calms down. I's wife falls in love with Vova and becomes pregnant by him. Then Vova and <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wife. Vova kills her and I becomes an idiot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} was [...] "Honest Man". Singer Kevin Martin {{said of the}} song, [...] "It {{reminds me of my}} father. He was a World War II veteran. He believed in the American dream with all his heart, he was the honest man of his generation. Now <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television and see Americans without jobs, without food and without a chance to help themselves. This song is a wake up call to the forces of the world who would dare to {{stand in the way of}} our ability to provide for ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{dared not}} tell her yet; I felt not sure of her; and at the doubt, and under the sense of {{impotence}} it brought with it, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poor woman with something near to anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring me yang-ban's {{garments}} {{as befits}} me," [...] I interrupted, [...] "and you shall see." [...] As I was led away in compliance, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ki-sang. [...] "And leave my slaves alone. They have journeyed far and are weary. They are my faithful slaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{wrenched}} {{my wrists}} {{free from the}} little tentacles that held them. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> goad-bearer. [...] "Confound you!" [...] I cried. [...] "I've warned you of that. What on earth do you think I'm made of, to stick that into me? If you touch me again--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] she whispered, [...] "I am {{standing}} where <b>I</b> can <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{light in a}} moment. If any one comes, you are here to see my South American curios. This is my own sitting-room. You understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|In lazy wonder, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> my head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow, {{and look}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of}} my bed.|$|R
5000|$|O'Brien {{was among}} {{a small group}} of Senators' players who had planned <b>on</b> {{attending}} <b>the</b> 2013 Boston Marathon. O'Brien and the other players had originally intended to be at the marathon's finish line during the time at which bombs exploded, killing and injuring several spectators and runners. Scratches for that night's game against the Boston Bruins, the players changed their plans at the last minute and elected to return to their hotel for a nap instead. [...] "Sure enough I wake up from a nap and have a bunch of text messages. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV ... it was just a twist of fate. It's definitely something that's hard to think about it. Thank goodness we didn't go", said O'Brien.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> goad-bearer {{behind me}} with a swift {{threatening}} gesture, and he started back. This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For {{one of those moments}} that seem to last for ever, we stood in angry protest, with a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow with {{a little}} moan, and at this {{juncture}} Jeeves entered with the vital oolong. I clutched at it like a drowning man at a straw hat. A deep sip or two, and I felt--I won't say restored, because a birthday party like Pongo Twistleton's isn't a thing you get restored after with a mere mouthful of tea, but sufficiently the old Bertram {{to be able to}} bend the mind on this awful thing which had come upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I'd bluff them, but Black and the Spaniard {{told me to}} play, though Kenwardine {{held back}} at first. Said they didn't want to take {{advantage}} of my rashness and I couldn't make good. Well, I saw how I could put it over, and it looked as if they couldn't stop me, until Black brought out a trump I didn't think he ought to have. After that I don't remember much, but imagine <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fellow and made some trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "How I {{hate this}} darkness! Wait till <b>I</b> can <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights, dear friend, {{and then you}} must embrace me. It is from outside, I believe. No, do not follow. I can find the switch for myself. Remain where you are. I return instantly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{anything}} to say before <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> you out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prairie?" [...] asked Coombs pompously; and remembering many an old grievance I answered with cheerful readiness: ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{had heard}} {{frequently}} of this queer, mournful mistake made {{by those who}} considered Sam'l unfortunate in his wife, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> Jess <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> main line of her story.|$|R
6000|$|At twenty-five {{past six}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hot {{water in the}} bath, and covertly {{swallowed}} a small glass of brandy. I then said, [...] "Half-past six; time for little boys to be in bed." [...] I said it in the matter-of-fact voice of one made free of the company of parents, as if I had said it often before, {{and would have to}} say it often again, and as if there was nothing particularly delicious to me in hearing myself say it. I tried to say it in that way.|$|E
6000|$|... "The mast came {{up like a}} ghost out of the black, {{and then}} a lot of fishes, and {{then a lot of}} {{flapping}} red seaweed, and then whack I came with a kind of dull bang {{on the deck of the}} Ocean Pioneer, and the fishes that had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road stuff in summer time. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compressed air again--for the suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all, in spite of the rum--and stood recovering myself. It struck coolish down there, and that helped take off the stuffiness a bit.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{old habits}} of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I could even see myself {{suddenly}} {{returning to the}} north, and all the dramatic effect of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed, but not to its damage. I should go back stronger than I had come. And then I thought of my lady. You see--how can I tell you? There were certain peculiarities of our relationship--as things are I need not tell about that--which would render her presence with me impossible. I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had to renounce her clearly and openly, if I was {{to do all that}} I could do in the north. And the man knew that, even as he talked to her and me, knew it as well as she did, that my steps to duty were--first, separation, then abandonment. At the touch of that thought my dream of a return was shattered. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man suddenly, as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me.|$|E
5000|$|In {{interviews}} {{made for}} the British documentary film Beyond Citizen Kane (1993), the Minister of Justice Armando Falcão (1974-1979) confirmed that [...] "Roberto Marinho never gave me any problems. When I was the minister in charge of censorship {{and he was the}} director of the TV Globo network, Radio Globo, Radio Mundial and Radio Eldorado, he never gave me any trouble." [...] The military president Médici (1969-1974) even claimed in an interview, about Jornal Nacional prime time news, [...] "I feel good every evening when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV to watch Jornal Nacional. While the news report of strikes, protests, attacks and conflicts {{in various parts of the}} world, Brazil marches in peace, towards development. It is as if I took a tranquilizer after a day's work". In 2012, a former deputy of the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS) related the proximity between the military regime and Rede Globo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellency, spare me," [...] I murmured. [...] "Did {{you know}} all my miserable story you would be merciful. Did you know with what joy <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Court of Pesaro--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{man and a}} boy. They {{were not}} together, but came to my hut at {{different}} times inquiring for you, but, knowing your desire for solitude, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> them away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong scent." ...|$|R
6000|$|As I {{continued}} to gaze, a shock went through me; the dimness {{of sleep and}} fatigue lifted from my eyes, as fog lifts in the Channel; and I beheld with startled clearness the photographic presentment of a crowd of strangers. [...] "J. Trent, Master" [...] {{at the top of}} the card directed me to a smallish, wizened man, with bushy eyebrows and full white beard, dressed in a frock-coat and white trousers; a flower stuck in his button-hole, his bearded chin set forward, his mouth clenched with habitual determination. There was not much of the sailor in his looks, but plenty of the martinet; a dry, precise man, who might pass for a preacher in some rigid sect; and, whatever he was, not the Captain Trent of San Francisco. The men, too, were all new to me: the cook, an unmistakable Chinaman, in his characteristic dress, standing apart on the poop steps. But perhaps <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole with the greatest curiosity to the figure labelled [...] "E. Goddedaal, 1st off." [...] He whom I had never seen, he might be the identical; he might be the clue and spring of all this mystery; and I scanned his features with the eye of a detective. He was of great stature, seemingly blonde as a Viking, his hair clustering round his head in frowsy curls, and two enormous whiskers, like the tusks of some strange animal, jutting from his cheeks. With these virile appendages and the defiant attitude in which he stood, the expression of his face only imperfectly harmonised. It was wild, heroic, and womanish-looking; and I felt I was prepared to hear he was a sentimentalist, and to see him weep.|$|E
5000|$|I Heard a Voice - Live from Long Beach Arena is {{the first}} live DVD release from the rock band AFI. It was {{released}} on December 12, 2006. The concert was filmed at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California on Friday, September 15, 2006. Part of the Decemberunderground Tour, the crowd was the largest AFI had ever headlined with over 13,000 people in attendance. The concert was shot in HD with more than 23 cameras. The title of this DVD is lifted from a line of poetry in the decemberunderground CD booklet. Underneath the song 37mm, it says: [...] "The power went out. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio. The power went out. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio. The power went out. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio....I heard a voice." [...] The moth (which appears to be some species of hummingbird moth) on the case is also from the decemberunderground booklet.|$|E
5000|$|A pipe {{connected}} the exhaust {{of a car}} to a bricked-up laboratory in the asylum. A few patients were shut {{into the room and}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> car engine. This killed the patients in eight minutes.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coarse and {{exciting}} {{life in the}} saloons and gambling hells, and spent all my time except when sleeping, out in the windy open under blue sky and starry heaven, my spirit had an uplift.|$|R
2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} Don't Shoot, It's Only Me! (1990), Bob Hope wrote, [...] "Dear old Bing. As we called him, the Economy-sized Sinatra. And what a voice. God I miss that voice. <b>I</b> can't even <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio around Christmas time without crying anymore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never fear, ma'am: {{accidents}} are strictly forbidden on this line. Besides which," [...] he added, with a solemn, turtle-like stare, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> key <b>on</b> <b>the</b> young lady, {{none of them}} young a-ogling Don Jooans can force their way in. Strict orders, ma'am." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV {{one day and}} {{it was the end of}} {{a detective}} series. I just caught the credits and it said Boney. Nice name, I thought - Boney, Boney, Boney... Boney M. Boney, Boney, Boney M. Nice sound. Simple.|$|E
50|$|Revolving {{the prayer}} wheel with her hands, {{she said her}} prayers with the utmost sincerity. The sound of her prayers came {{from the bottom of}} her heart.  Deeply moved by her sincerity, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recorder.  She noticed me and gently pressed my head to the {{sacrificial}} altar as a blessing.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of their}} first {{breakthroughs}} was winning the ICA B-Town Rap Battle in 1986. In 1988 they released the single, [...] "We're Notorious." [...] Current Boston hip hop favorite Akrobatik said [...] "Initially I would think of RSO Crew who were from here and making any type of noise. Locally, if <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio, those would be the guys that I would {{know who they were}} and follow their songs. I've definitely been checking them out from the beginning." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Atys rose on his fetlocks! Despite his double burden, {{the good}} steed meant to have it. He deemed, perchance, {{he was with}} the Quorn or the Baron's. He rose; he sprang. The deep yellow water, cold in the moon's rays, with the {{farthest}} bank but a chill grey line in the mist, lay beneath us! A moment that seemed an eternity! Then we landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far-off further bank, {{and for the first time}} I could take a pull at his head. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river's brim, and leaped him back again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The old, brutal desperado, {{whose face}} and mind are a libel upon human nature, {{has had the}} {{insolence}} to speak to his master's niece as one whom he was at liberty to admire; and when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> him with <b>the</b> anger and contempt he merited, the wretch grumbled out something, as if he held the destiny of our family in his hand.' ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} one strip {{highlighting}} Hägar's good intentions but cluelessness: Hägar returns from looting Paris with a present for his wife, Helga.

When nothing happens, Hägar comments, [...] "That's funny, when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> it <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> palace, water came out." ...|$|R
