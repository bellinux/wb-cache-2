5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game {{appeared}} to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

Most of the players on both teams (including Colvin) thought the lateral was an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> and the play was over, but New England's Vince Wilfork realized the play was still ongoing and recovered the fumble. After picking up the ball, Wilfork ran 31 yards to the Jets 15-yard line before being tackled by Cotchery, setting up Gostkowski's third field goal to make the score 23–13.|$|E

50|$|A {{scrimmage}} down {{begins with}} a snap, where the center throws or hands the ball backward {{to one of the}} backs, usually the quarterback. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball, or runs with it himself. The down ends when the ball becomes dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot becomes the line of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass,</b> the ball is returned to the spot where it was last snapped to begin the next play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.|$|E
50|$|In {{the closing}} {{moments of the}} fourth quarter of the game in a snowy Foxboro Stadium, with New England {{trailing}} by three points, New England quarterback Tom Brady dropped back to pass. After he had begun a passing motion, Brady apparently ceased his throwing motion, pulled his right hand down below his shoulder and had touched the ball to his left hand when, coming off the strong side corner blitz, Charles Woodson knocked the ball out of Brady's hands. Raiders middle linebacker Greg Biekert then fell on the loose football. The officials initially called the play a recovered fumble, which would have sealed the victory for the Raiders. But after instant replay, referee Walt Coleman reversed this call, declared the play an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass,</b> and gave possession back to New England. In explaining the reversal to the audience, Coleman stated that the ball was moving forward {{at the time it was}} dropped. In later interviews, Coleman stated that it was his explanation, not the reversal, that was in error; the ball was moving backwards when it was lost, but the tuck rule applied. Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri later tied the game with a 45-yard field goal; in overtime, the Patriots defeated the Raiders on another field goal. Two games later, the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI.|$|E

Going into the 1965 UCLA-USC rivalry football game ranked #7, the conference championship and 1966 Rose Bowl were on the line. #6 USC, led by Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16-6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play. After the two-point conversion made it 16-14, UCLA recovered an onside kick. Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a 50-yard bomb and UCLA won, 20-16. Integrated UCLA then faced all-white Tennessee in the newly built Liberty Bowl stadium in Memphis, Prothro's native city. On the last play of the game, Tennessee defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass to save a Volunteer win by a score of 37-34. Tennessee's winning drive was aided by a controversial pass interference call, the clock had questionably stopped twice, and a dropped pass {{that appeared to be}} a lateral was recovered by UCLA but was later ruled an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass.</b> After the game, Prothro stated, [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life, I am ashamed to be a Southerner." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of the <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> in American football shows how the game has evolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today.

5000|$|The {{moment that}} a forward pass begins is {{important}} to the game. The pass begins the moment the passer's arm begins to move forward. If the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a fumble and therefore a loose ball. In this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. If the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched.The quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few paces after the ball is snapped. This places him in an area called the [...] "pocket", which is a protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side. A quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling. Under NFL and NCAA rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. NFHS (high school) rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap. If he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called [...] "intentional grounding" [...] is assessed. In Canadian football the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage—whether he is inside or outside of the [...] "pocket"—to avoid the foul of [...] "intentionally grounding".|$|E
5000|$|In American {{football}} and Canadian football, not all players on offense {{are entitled to}} receive a <b>forward</b> <b>pass.</b> Only an eligible pass receiver may legally catch a <b>forward</b> <b>pass,</b> and only an eligible receiver may advance beyond the neutral zone if a <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> crosses the neutral zone. If the pass is received by a non-eligible receiver, it is [...] "illegal touching" [...] (five yards and loss of down). If an ineligible receiver is beyond the neutral zone when a <b>forward</b> <b>pass</b> crossing the neutral zone is thrown, a foul of [...] "ineligible receiver downfield" [...] (five yards, but no loss of down) is called. Each league has slightly different rules regarding who is considered an eligible receiver.|$|R
