5|$|The third spirit, the <b>Ghost</b> of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The <b>ghost</b> {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the <b>ghost</b> to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the <b>ghost</b> can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the <b>ghost</b> shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The <b>ghost</b> then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the <b>ghost</b> that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, Blizzard Entertainment began {{collaboration}} with Swingin' Ape Studios {{to work on}} the game, and bought the company in May 2005. Despite anticipation for the game by industry journalists, <b>Ghost</b> was delayed again and its release date was pushed back to September 2005. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2005, <b>Ghost</b> was officially reannounced, but the GameCube version was canceled by Swingin' Ape Studios due to the platform's lack of online support. The game's release was again delayed until 2006. Despite the efforts of Swingin' Ape, <b>Ghost</b> failed to materialize as scheduled, and in March 2006 Blizzard Entertainment announced an indefinite postponement on development of <b>Ghost</b> while the company explored new options with the emerging seventh generation of video game consoles. Despite its long development history, IGN noted that the concept of <b>Ghost</b> still held promise. Although the game's development was suspended, Keith R. A.

40|$|A common print quality {{problem in}} {{electrophotographic}} (EP) printing is <b>ghosting.</b> <b>Ghosting</b> {{refers to a}} vestigial image repeated at regular intervals {{down the length of}} a page and appearing as light or dark areas (negative or positive <b>ghosting,</b> respectively) relative to the surrounding field. There are many sources of <b>ghosting,</b> including most EP printer subsystems and many of their components. Subsystems from charging, development, photoreceptor, to fusing can all produce <b>ghosting.</b> The <b>ghosts</b> can be both positive and negative (darker and lighter). Having multiple <b>ghosting</b> sources can make the sources of <b>ghosting</b> difficult to determine, pointing to the need for reliable diagnostic tools. This paper demonstrates how a commercially-available image analysis system is used to quantify <b>ghosting</b> and diagnose its causes. The system utilizes test targets specifically designed to reveal <b>ghosting</b> problems and are optimized for automated inspection. The analysis method uses frequency domain techniques that make it possible to isolate <b>ghosting</b> from other print quality problems. The method can also correlate observed <b>ghosting</b> to the printer component or components causing it. In addition to its role in R&D, the method is suitable for production environments as a quantitative tool for setting acceptance limits and performing quality control prior to shipping the product...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ghosts</b> must {{be avoided}} {{when they are}} their normal colors.

5000|$|Hungry <b>ghosts</b> are {{different}} from the <b>ghosts</b> of Chinese traditions, which all people are believed to become after death. According to the Buddha Dharma, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot. [...] Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. The <b>ghosts</b> with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. The <b>ghosts</b> with great wealth also have three subgroups: the <b>ghosts</b> of sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; the <b>ghosts</b> of losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and the <b>ghosts</b> of great powers, like yakshas and rakshasas, who are the powerful rulers of <b>ghosts.</b> The <b>ghosts</b> of sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas the <b>ghosts</b> of great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry <b>ghosts,</b> however, most have little or no wealth and are extremely hungry.|$|R
