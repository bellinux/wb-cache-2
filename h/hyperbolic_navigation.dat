50|$|Meint Harms was {{the first}} to have {{attempted}} the construction of a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> systems, starting with musings on the topic in 1931 as part of his master's examination at Seefahrtschule Lübeck (Navigation College).

50|$|Loran-C was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> {{system which}} allowed a {{receiver}} {{to determine its}} position by listening to low frequency radio signals transmitted by fixed land-based radio beacons. Loran-C combined two different techniques to provide a signal that was both long-range and highly accurate, traits that had formerly been at odds. The downside was {{the expense of the}} equipment needed to interpret the signals, which meant that Loran-C was used primarily by militaries after it was first introduced in 1957.|$|R
50|$|LORAN, {{short for}} long range <b>navigation,</b> was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> system {{developed}} in the United States during World War II. It {{was similar to the}} UK's Gee system but operated at lower frequencies in order to provide improved range up to 1500 miles km with accuracy of tens of miles. It was first used for ship convoys crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and then by long-range patrol aircraft, but found its main use on the ships and aircraft operating in the Pacific theatre.|$|R
50|$|The {{gyrocompass}} {{was introduced}} in 1908 while ship's radar came in after the 1930s. Radar is also used on land for monitoring the position of shipping, for example in the Strait of Dover which is the busiest area of sea in the world. The Decca Navigator System was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> system that was installed around the coasts of Britain in the 1940s. It was phased out after the introduction of satellite-based navigation from the 1960s. The echo sounding {{was introduced in}} the 1930s to determine water depth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} these <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> systems was the UK'S Gee and Decca, {{followed}} by the US LORAN and LORAN-C systems. LORAN-C offered accurate navigation at distances over 1,000 kilometres, and by locating [...] "chains" [...] of stations around the world, they offered moderately widespread coverage.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} of radio-based <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> {{was well known}} in the 1930s, but the {{equipment}} needed to build it was not widely available at the time. The main problem involved the accurate determination of the difference in timing of two closely spaced signals, differences in milli- and micro-seconds.|$|E
50|$|Multilateration is {{a common}} {{technique}} in radio navigation systems, where it is known as <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation.</b> These systems are relatively easy to construct {{as there is no}} need for a common clock, and the difference in the signal timing can be measured visibly using an oscilloscope. This formed the basis of a number of widely used navigation systems starting in World War II with the British Gee system and several similar systems introduced over the next few decades. The introduction of the microprocessor greatly simplified operation, greatly increasing popularity during the 1980s. The most popular <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system was LORAN-C, which was used around the world until the system was shut down in 2010. Other systems continue to be used, but the widespread use of satellite navigation systems like GPS have made these systems largely redundant.|$|E
50|$|Also, by 1940 the British {{had started}} {{development}} {{of a number of}} night navigation aids, and were already testing the Gee <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system on combat missions. These would be available in quantity in early 1942, just as the first of the new heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, would be arriving in quantity. These technological developments dovetailed with the policy changes influenced by Lindemann's report.|$|E
50|$|Gee, {{sometimes}} written GEE, was a {{radio navigation}} system used by the Royal Air Force during World War II. It measured the time delay between two radio signals to produce a fix, with accuracy {{on the order of}} a few hundred metres at ranges up to about 350 mi. It was the first <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system to be used operationally, entering service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942.|$|E
50|$|The US {{had also}} {{considered}} <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> {{as early as}} 1940, and started a development effort known as Project 3 that was similar to Gee. Only halting progress {{had been made by}} the time they were introduced to Gee, which was already entering production. Gee was immediately selected for the 8th Air Force and the Project 3 team turned their attention to other uses, eventually considering convoy navigation in particular.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the last}} <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> systems to enter {{operational}} use {{was one of the}} earliest to be developed; Omega traces its history to work by John Alvin Pierce in the 1940s, working on the same basic idea as the Decca phase-comparison system. He imagined a system specifically for medium-accuracy global navigation, and thus selected the extremely low frequency of 10 kHz {{as the basis for the}} signal. However, the problem with phase ambiguity, as in the case of Decca, meant that the system was not practical at the time.|$|E
50|$|Decca, OMEGA, and LORAN-C {{are three}} similar <b>{{hyperbolic}}</b> <b>navigation</b> systems. Decca was a hyperbolic low frequency {{radio navigation system}} (also known as multilateration) that was first deployed during World War II when the Allied forces needed a system {{which could be used}} to achieve accurate landings. As was the case with Loran C, its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving-map displays. The system was deployed in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to oil platforms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> <b>{{navigation}}</b> {{refers to}} a class of navigation systems based on the difference in timing between the reception of two signals, without reference to a common clock. This timing reveals the difference in distance from the receiver to the two stations. Plotting all of the potential locations of the receiver for the measured delay produces a series of hyperbolic lines on a chart. Taking two such measurements and looking for the intersections of the hyperbolic lines reveals the receiver's location to be {{in one of two}} locations. Any other form of navigation information can be used to eliminate this ambiguity and determine a fix.|$|E
50|$|The first {{operational}} <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> was UK's Gee, {{first used}} experimentally by RAF Bomber Command in 1941. Gee was used both for bombing over Germany {{as well as}} navigation {{in the area of}} the UK, especially for landing at night. Several Gee chains were built in the UK, and after the war this expanded for four chains in the UK, two in France, and one in northern Germany. For a period following the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization in 1946, Gee was considered as the basis for a worldwide standard for navigation, but the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) system was selected instead, and the last Gee chain was eventually shut down in 1970.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> {{systems are}} a {{modified}} form of transponder systems which {{eliminate the need}} for an airborne transponder. The name refers {{to the fact that they}} do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific navigational chart with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver's location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced navigation systems until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|At a 1 October 1940 {{meeting of}} the US Army Signal Corps' Technical Committee, Alfred Loomis, chair of the Microwave Committee, {{proposed}} building a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system. He predicted that such a system could provide an accuracy of at least 1000 feet m at a range of 200 mi, and a maximum range of 300-500 mi for high-flying aircraft. This led to the [...] "Precision Navigational Equipment for Guiding Airplanes" [...] specification, which {{was sent back to}} the Microwave Committee and formed up as [...] "Project 3". Orders for initial systems were sent out at a follow-up meeting on 20 December 1940.

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{implement}} the timing measurements needed for a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system, pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN, and phase-timing systems like the Decca Navigator System. The former requires sharp pulses of signal, and their accuracy is generally limited to how rapidly the pulses can be turned on and off, which is, in turn, a function of the carrier frequency. There is an ambiguity in the signal, the same measurements can be valid at two locations relative to the broadcasters, but in normal operation these are hundreds of kilometers apart so one possibility can be eliminated. The second system requires constant signals ("continuous wave") and is easy to use even at low frequencies. However, its signal is ambiguous over the distance of a wavelength, meaning there are hundreds of locations that will return the same signal, referred to as cells in Decca. This demands some other navigation method to be used in conjunction to pick which cell the receiver is within.|$|E
5000|$|Project 3, a {{long-range}} navigation system, was {{of particular interest}} to Great Britain. They had an existing <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> system, called GEE, but it was inadequate, in both range and accuracy, to support aircraft during bombing runs on distant targets in Europe. When briefed by the Tizard Mission about GEE, Alfred Loomis personally conceptualized a new type of system that would overcome the deficiencies of GEE, and the development of his LORAN (an acronym for Long Range Navigation) was adopted as an initial project. The LORAN Division was established for the project and headed by Donald G. Fink. Operating in the Low Frequency (LF) portion of the radio spectrum, LORAN was the only non-microwave project of the Rad Lab. Incorporating major elements of GEE, LORAN was highly successful and beneficial to the war effort. By the end of hostilities, about 30 percent of the Earth's surface was covered by LORAN stations and used by 75,000 aircraft and surface vessels. [...] Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, work at the Rad Lab greatly expanded. At the height of its activities, the Rad Lab employed nearly 4,000 people working in several countries. The Rad Lab had constructed, and was the initial occupant of, MIT's famous Building 20. Costing just over $1 million, {{this was one of the}} longest-surviving World War II temporary structures.|$|E
