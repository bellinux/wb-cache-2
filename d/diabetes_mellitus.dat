5|$|Other {{disease states}} can also {{increase}} the risk of developing tuberculosis. These include alcoholism and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> (three-fold increase).|$|E
5|$|The use of Borjomi {{water has}} been {{suggested}} by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several digestive diseases and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and asthma. As a result, obesity {{has been found to}} reduce life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica {{has long}} been a rare disease. Today, it appears in only 2% of {{individuals}} diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, which accounts for 90% of instances of the disease. Primary hyperparathyroidism is three times as common in individuals with <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> is a {{risk factor}} for {{pancreatic}} cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who have been diagnosed with Type2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases {{people may not}} realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, O'Hara's family {{contacted}} {{social workers}} regarding claims that O'Hara, who had short-term memory loss, {{was a victim}} of elder abuse. In September 2012, O'Hara flew to the US after receiving doctor's permission to fly, and moved in with her grandson in Idaho. In her last years she suffered from <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 2 and short-term memory loss.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and {{increasing}} age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b>|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{returned}} to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of atheism. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined {{to be caused by}} diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and nearly died. She was later diagnosed with <b>Diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 1, and is now insulin-dependent. In 2003, following the recommendation of her husband and shortly after his death, Rice underwent gastric bypass surgery and shed 103 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate that it {{may be a}} possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> type 2 have also been shown to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E
25|$|The {{progression}} to type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> is {{not inevitable}} {{for those with}} prediabetes. The progression into <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> from prediabetes is approximately 25% over three to five years.|$|E
