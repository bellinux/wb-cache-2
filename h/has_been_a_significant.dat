The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both {{to the public and}} in academic settings.

5|$|The Shickshinny Water Company used {{a stream}} in the Shickshinny Creek {{watershed}} as a water {{supply in the}} early 1900s. Little Shickshinny Creek {{has been used as}} a water supply for Shickshinny, as well as Mocanaqua. Agriculture <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> industry in the watershed in the past. The streams of the watershed also power small mills.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, {{it is probable that}} there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant,</b> and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who {{made significant contributions to}} the doctrine of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen. Since the mid-twentieth century, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving universal salvation, which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of the entire universe. This lower limit <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate {{higher than the national}} rate.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities and there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E

Overall, they spend about DKK 3billion ($540million) in the city each year. The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or {{as a part of a}} round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average.|$|E
5|$|The {{credibility}} of Miami-Dade Transit and the County as a whole, including {{the validity of}} their ridership estimates and revenue forecasts, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impediment to their qualifications for funding under the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) approval. In 2011, Miami-Dade Transit underwent a serious federal investigation and takeover by the FTA {{in which it was}} forced to open its books over suspicions of money mismanagement. The Agency threatened to cease its funding used to cover operational costs, which would have meant significant cuts in service; however, they took the funding under their strict control to prevent this from happening.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor in its survival. In the past, largely due {{its lack of}} color variations, the Buckeye {{has not been an}} especially popular exhibition breed, but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the}} most visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline. The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> employer in both the oil and renewables industries.|$|E

50|$|Breton Nationalism <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{force in}} the early 20th century through the Breton National Party, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discredited by its {{association}} with collaborationism in World War II.
