Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time gang member with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling {{to keep him out}} of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation <b>Day</b> <b>Trader.</b> The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance. Coleman, who was nearly expelled as a sophomore, graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, IL in 2009. He has studied at Northern Michigan University.|$|E

40|$|Harris and Schultz (1998) {{found that}} Nasdaq <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> made {{money at the}} expense of market-makers, despite having less information. • As part of Shellenberger, et al. (1999) ’s report into day trading, {{randomly}} selected short-term trading accounts which existed within the period 1997 – 1998 were analyzed. Seventy percent of the accounts lost money and were traded in a manner that realized a 100 % risk of ruin (loss of all funds), whilst only 11. 5 % of the accounts reviewed evidenced the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading. • In 1999 Mark Barton, a daytrader who had lost $ 105 000, shot and killed nine people at two day trading firms in Atlanta, US. Barton committed suicide hours later. • Jordan and Diltz (2003) considered US <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> and found that approximately 20 percent were more than marginally profitable. • Barber, et al. (2005) analyzed the performance of <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> in Taiwan. They found that in the typical six month period, more than eight out of ten <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> lose money; however, there is strong evidence of persistent ability for a relatively small group of <b>day</b> <b>traders.</b> • Linnainmaa (2005) examined the complete trading records of <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> in Finland. He found that only 3 out of 10 <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> earned positive profits in a typical month, individual <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> are reluctant to close losing day trades, and day trading profits and long-term performance are negatively related. • Lo, Repin and Steenbarger (2005) performed a clinical study of <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> and found that “subjects whose emotional reactions to monetary gains and losses were more intense on both the positive and negative side exhibited significantly worse trading performance, implying a negative correlation between successful trading behavior and emotional reactivity”. In conclusion, 70 %– 80 % of <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> lose money...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how {{profitable}} {{day trading}} occurs {{and how it}} impacts trading on Nasdaq stocks. Our paper analyzes a unique data set on 96, 323 trades from the proprietary stock trading team of an U. S. day trading firm. We find profitable <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> trade when and where liquidity traders are present. That is, they prefer and are more profitable trading in the morning, on higher volatility days, on higher volume days, on large capitalization Nasdaq stocks, and in an anonymous dealer capacity over the Island ECN. In addition, we find profitable <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> precede most market makers in updating their quotes. This latter finding is surprising considering <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> have an informational disadvantage to competing Nasdaq dealers. The ability of profitable <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> to rapidly update their quotes and subsequently capture liquidity trader order flow reduces market-making profits, lowers spreads, and leads to efficient price discovery...|$|R

40|$|A {{specific}} day-trading {{policy in}} Taiwan futures market allows {{an investigation of}} the performance of <b>day</b> <b>traders.</b> Since October 2007, investors who characterize themselves as “day traders” by closing their day-trade positions on the same day enjoy a 50 % reduction in the initial margin. Because we can identify <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> ex ante, we have a laboratory to explore trading behavior without the contamination of potential behavioral biases. Our results show that the 3470 individual <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> in the sample incur on average a significant loss of 61, 500 (26, 700) New Taiwan dollars after (before) transaction costs over October 2007 –September 2008. This implies that <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> are not only overconfident about the accuracy of their information but also biased in their interpretations of information. We also find that excessive trading is hazardous only to the overconfident losers, but not to the winners.

Do Individual <b>Day</b> <b>Traders</b> Make Money? Evidence from Taiwan When an investor buys and sells the same stock on the same day, {{he has made a}} day trade. We analyze the performance of <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> in Taiwan. <b>Day</b> trading by individual investors is prevalent in Taiwan – accounting for over 20 percent of total volume from 1995 through 1999. Individual investors account for over 97 percent of all day trading activity. Day trading is extremely concentrated. About one percent of individual investors account for half of day trading and one fourth of total trading by individual investors. Heavy <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> earn gross profits, but their profits are not sufficient to cover transaction costs.

50|$|The {{common use}} of buying on margin (using {{borrowed}} funds) amplifies gains and losses, such that substantial losses or gains {{can occur in}} {{a very short period of}} time. In addition, brokers usually allow bigger margins for day traders. In the USA for example, while the overnight margins required to hold a stock position are normally 50% of the stock's value, many brokers allow pattern <b>day</b> <b>trader</b> accounts to use levels as low as 25% for intraday purchases. This means a <b>day</b> <b>trader</b> with the legal minimum $25,000 in his or her account can buy $100,000 (4x leverage) worth of stock during the day, as long as half of those positions are exited before the market close. Because of the high risk of margin use, and of other day trading practices, a <b>day</b> <b>trader</b> will often have to exit a losing position very quickly, in order to prevent a greater, unacceptable loss, or even a disastrous loss, much larger than his or her original investment, or even larger than his or her total assets.|$|E
50|$|Day traders' {{objective}} is to make profits {{by taking advantage of}} price movements in highly liquid stocks or indexes. According to Adam Leitzes and Josh Solan (Bulls, Bears and Brains: Investing With the Best and Brightest of the Financial Internet), the more volatile the market, the more favorable the conditions for the <b>day</b> <b>trader,</b> regardless of the longer-term direction in the market. Unlike some fund managers and investors who hold positions over longer periods of time and are averse to selling equities short, the <b>day</b> <b>trader</b> is not committed to a position and can adapt to whatever condition the market is in, at any given moment.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{reasons for}} the surge in retail forex trading include the now high margin {{requirements}} in individual U.S. equities (stocks) for <b>day</b> <b>traders</b> imposed after 2001, and apparent overt manipulation of commodities markets by banks, making commodity futures markets a less desirable market in which to participate.
