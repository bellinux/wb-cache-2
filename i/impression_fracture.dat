30|$|Today, {{the skull}} x-ray only plays a {{historical}} {{role in the}} treatment of TBI patients. In patients with impaired consciousness and a skull fracture, the probability of an intracranial hemorrhage amounts to 1 in 4 (Mendelow et al. 1983). On the other hand, patients with clear consciousness and no skull fracture only show a probability of 1 : 6000 of developing an intracranial hemorrhage. If a skull fracture is detected by skull x-ray in a patient with clear consciousness, he should be transferred to an institution where a CT scan can be performed soon (Brandt et al. 2009). The fractures detectable by skull x-ray are divided into linear <b>fractures,</b> <b>impression</b> <b>fractures</b> (or expression fractures) and burst fractures. The location of the fracture may be classified as fractures of the convexity, fractures of the skull base, frontobasal fractures, temporal bone fractures, and fractures of the condyles.|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of osseous deficiencies asso-ciated with anterior shoulder instability have been a chal-lenge to physicians for centuries, with reports of the treat-ment of humeral head <b>impression</b> <b>fractures</b> dating as early as 1741. 2 Whereas historical goals centered on the stable reduction and prevention of recurrent dislocation, current standards of success are predicated on the restoration of motion and strength and the return to functional activi-ties, including competitive athletics. Contemporary recon-structive procedures avoid overtightening and emphasize restoration of the structural and functional integrity of the capsulolabral complex, with bony procedures indicated for cases in which osseous defects of the humeral head or gle-noid result in or contribute to the recurrent instability and, if not addressed, lead to a higher incidence of failure. Successful management is thus dependent on the recogni-tion of these often challenging injuries, as well as a full understanding of the indications associated with the rele-vant interventions. Although many surgical procedures have been described for the management of osseous defi-ciencies in association with anterior shoulder instability, in our experience, such procedures are seldom necessary. The purpose of this summary is to review treatment options as well as indications and techniques to address bony deficiencies. PATHOMECHANICS The evolution of the surgical treatment of shoulder insta-bility has been based on increasing appreciation of the del-icate balance between range of motion of the glenohumeral joint, which allows for placement of the upper extremity in space, and stability of the articulation, which allows for functional activities. Glenohumeral instability may arise from disruption of the well-recognized static and dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral articulation 8; accordingly, any osseous abnormalities of the normal articular anato-my, such as humeral head impression defects (Hill-Sachs lesion), glenoid fractures, or anteroinferior glenoid rim loss, result in a loss of glenohumeral congruency and may contribute to shoulder instability...|$|R

40|$|Recovery and {{comparison}} of toolmarks, footprint <b>impressions,</b> and <b>fractured</b> surfaces {{connected to a}} crime scene are of great importance in forensic science. The purpose of this project is to provide statistical tools for the validation of the proposition that particular manufacturing processes produce marks on the work-product (or tool) that are substantially different from tool to tool.

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{network of}} the Jandeíra Formation {{in the northeastern}} part of Brazil is controlled by two main (paleo-) stress fields. The first stress field, characterized by a NS-oriented compression, occurred from the Campanian to the Miocene. The second occurred from the Miocene to the Quaternary as an EW-oriented compression. In the western and {{central part of the}} Potiguar Basin it shifts to a NW-SE-oriented compression and a NE-SW-oriented extension. Both stress fields resulted in a heterogeneous fracture network throughout the whole basin. This system has been analyzed with imagery from around 50 meters above the ground with a resolution of 1. 5 cm/pixel. Three main fracture sets are found in the studied outcrop, though in the outcrop itself the sets are highly heterogeneous spread; which supports the conventional outcrop studies. The length distribution of EW fractures are strongly influenced by abutment i. e. earlier fractures have restricted the propagation of succeeding fractures. This study shows that fracture length distributions and spatial distribution are exponentially distributed.

40|$|Purpose: Anteroposterior knee {{stability}} is a relevant {{factor for the}} decision-making process of various surgical procedures. In degenerative joints when the implantation of unicompartimental prostheses or corrective osteotomies of the limb are planned, {{the integrity of the}} anteroposterior stability with an intact ACL has been regarded as a necessary prerequisite. We hypothesise that joint degeneration, however, may influence the anteroposterior knee laxity. Therefore, we set out to test this hypothesis simulating a progressively ‘degenerated’ joint in an experimental cadaveric setting. Methods: Twelve intact transfemorally resected Thiel-fixated cadaver knee joints were divided into 2 groups for manipulation in the medial or lateral compartment. In each knee, we performed (1) unilateral total meniscectomy; (2) simulation of advanced osteoarthritis, by unilateral total cartilage debridement; (3) simulation of a unilateral tibial <b>impression</b> <b>fracture,</b> by resection of 5 mm of the tibial plateau; (4) transection of the ACL. The KT- 1000 arthrometer was used to measure the extent of anteroposterior translation at 30 ° of knee flexion.

30|$|An {{approximately}} 7  cm incision from slightly lateral to the {{coracoid process}} was made {{running along the}} deltopectoral groove. The posterolateral surface of the humeral head was carefully inspected by palpation {{for the presence of}} an <b>impression</b> <b>fracture</b> (Hill-Sachs lesion). After exposing the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, it was vertically transected, 1 – 2  cm proximal from its insertion on the minor tubercle. After incising the capsule, a Fukuda retractor was used facilitating inspection of the glenoid surface. When a labral detachment (i.e., Bankart lesion) was identified, it was repaired in the following way. The labrum was reattached to the anterior glenoidal rim together with the capsule using suture anchors. In case of a capsular tear, a capsular repair was performed. Subsequently, the subscapularis muscle was shortened by transferring the medial part under the lateral part; consequently, imbrication of the capsule was achieved in all patients. Over-tightening of the subscapularis muscle may lead to an undue post-operative restriction in range of motion. In order to asses whether the subscapularis muscle and capsule were not too tight or too loose, the arm was placed alongside the body with the elbow in 90 ° flexion with the thumb pointing up during subscapularis reefing. In this position, the shoulder was required to reach neutral position (0 ° of external rotation). However, when unsupported, gravity was not expected to externally rotate the arm any further. It {{should be noted that the}} lateral stump of the subscapularis muscle was not attached to the anterior glenoid rim as customary in the original Putti-Platt procedure. This modified Putti-Platt procedure, which was used for all patients in this study, has also been described elsewhere [12, 13, 14]. Post-operatively, all patients received an immobilizing sling (e.g., Polysling or Gilchrist). Between weeks two and six, only circumduction exercises were allowed. From 6  weeks onward, patients were permitted external rotation and strength-enhancing exercises if tolerated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Any {{cartilage}} {{damage to}} the glenohumeral joint should be avoided, as these damages may result in osteoarthritis of the shoulder. To understand the pathomechanism leading to shoulder cartilage damage, we conducted a systematic review {{on the subject of}} articular cartilage lesions caused by traumas where non <b>impression</b> <b>fracture</b> of the subchondral bone is present. Methods PubMed (MEDLINE), ScienceDirect (EMBASE, BIOBASE, BIOSIS Previews) and the COCHRANE database of systematic reviews were systematically scanned using a defined search strategy to identify relevant articles in this field of research. First selection was done based on abstracts according to specific criteria, where the methodological quality in selected full text articles was assessed by two reviewers. Agreement between raters was investigated using percentage agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistic. The traumatic events were divided into two categories: 1) acute trauma which refers to any single impact situation which directly damages the articular cartilage, and 2) chronic trauma which means cartilage lesions due to overuse or disuse of the shoulder joint. Results The agreement on data quality between the two reviewers was 93 % with a Kappa value of 0. 79 indicating an agreement considered to be 'substantial'. It was found that acute trauma on the shoulder causes humeral articular cartilage to disrupt from the underlying bone. The pathomechanism is said to be due to compression or shearing, which can be caused by a sudden subluxation or dislocation. However, such impact lesions are rarely reported. In the case of chronic trauma glenohumeral cartilage degeneration is a result of overuse and is associated to other shoulder joint pathologies. In these latter cases it is the rotator cuff which is injured first. This can result in instability and consequent impingement which may progress to glenohumeral cartilage damage. Conclusion The great majority of glenohumeral cartilage lesions without any bony lesions are the results of overuse. Glenohumeral cartilage lesions with an intact subchondral bone and caused by an acute trauma are either rare or overlooked. And at increased risk for such cartilage lesions are active sportsmen with high shoulder demand or athletes prone to shoulder injury. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The Institute of Forensic Medicine {{was founded}} by Professor Milovan Milovanović (1884 - 1948) in 1923 as part of School of Medicine of the University of Belgrade, and also {{established}} the Institute’s forensic collection worthy of a museum. This paper illustrates the way Professor Milovanović made this collection into a teaching aid for student education. We present a case of crime of passion from the year 1931, from our Institute’s collection. Case Outline. The victim was a 30 -year-old woman with multiple stab wounds of the head, neck and arms. It was noted in the case history that the deceased woman was a maid with a wealthy merchant, {{as well as that}} she had “dubious morals” for that time, with three wooers at the same time. Injuries to the forearms and the index finger prove that the victim tried to defend herself. In the autopsy record there is a drawn figure of a kitchen knife with a rounded blade tip, which explains the absence of stab wounds to the skull, and the presence of the <b>impression</b> skull <b>fractures</b> and crushed skull bones. It was concluded that the death occurred due to exsanguination, in turn due to transection of the left carotid artery, probably caused by sharp force, while the manner of death was homicide. Some of the most prominent autopsy findings were multiple mutilating overkill sharp force injuries, localized on the head, indicated sexually motivated murder. Conclusion. Combining the museum specimen, diagrams with injuries, drawn figure of the kitchen knife used, and photographs taken during the autopsy and the police investigation, Professor Milovanović was able to properly illustrate this intriguing case to students without a computer or a PowerPoint presentation.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of fracture healing {{is largely a}} matter of clinical judgement, often based on observing x-rays showing the formation of bridging callus or obscuration of the fracture line and an <b>impression</b> of <b>fracture</b> stiffness obtained by manual loading. In circumstances where these assessment methods are compromised, for example in fractures stabilised using either external fixation or intramedullary nailing, the determination of healing can be problematic. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) provides a quick, non-invasive and quantitative method of measuring bone density, which could enable the change in mineral content at a healing site to be monitored. This study evaluated the viability of using DXA to assess the healing of tibial fractures stabilised using intramedullary nails and external fixators. Trials have been undertaken on a Lunar DPX-L scanner situated at South Cleveland Hospital, Middlesbrough. Aluminium and hydroxyapatite phantoms {{have been used to}} determine the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of the DXA measurements. Small fracture gaps of less than 0. 05 mm were detectable on both simulated transverse and oblique fractures. BMD values which one might expect at a fracture site could be accurately measured down to 0. 16 g cm(^- 2) 14 Patients with tibial fractures (6 with intramedullary nails and 8 with external fixators) have been measured at 4 week intervals following trauma. The bone mineral density (BMD) at regions of interest along the fractured tibial shaft were compared to the non-fractured contra-lateral. Anatomical landmarks were used to relocate the regions of interest between scans and good reproducibility of results (coefficient of variation = 3. 36 %) was obtained. After an initial fall in the first month, the BMD at the fracture site gradually increased to the original unfractured value by approximately the fifth month post-fracture. Proximal and distal to the trauma site there was a gradual decrease in BMD in all of the patients, which persisted for about 5 months post-fracture...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The risk of {{atypical}} fracture of the femur {{is associated with}} bisphosphonate use. While characterizing atypical fractures from a previous nationwide study in radiographic detail, we had the <b>impression</b> that the <b>fractures</b> were located either in the subtrochanteric region or in the shaft. We determined {{whether there is a}} dichotomy in this respect. less thanbrgreater than less thanbrgreater thanPatients and methods The distance between the atypical fractures and the lesser trochanter was measured on plain radiographs from 129 of 160 patients with atypical fractures, taken from 2008 through 2010. Analysis of the distances measured showed 2 clusters, which were then analyzed with regard to bisphosphonate use and age. less thanbrgreater than less thanbrgreater thanResults The distribution of the distances would be best described as 2 clusters, with a dichotomy at 8 cm. The proximal (subtrochanteric) cluster comprised 25 patients who were generally younger (median 71 years) than the 104 patients in the cluster with shaft fractures (median 80 years). The 95 % CI for the difference between medians was 4 - 11 years. Of the patients with subtrochanteric fractures, 18 of 25 used bisphosphonates as compared to 89 of 104 with shaft fractures. less thanbrgreater than less thanbrgreater thanInterpretation The younger age and possibly smaller proportion of bisphosphonate users in the subtrochanteric cluster may be compatible with a greater influence of mechanical stress in the underlying pathophysiology of proximal fractures.

40|$|Compression {{testing of}} tri-isotropic (TRISO) carbon/silicon carbide-coated fuel {{particles}} between anvil materials {{with a wide}} range of hardnesses was investigated. During compression testing, the particle produces a hardness <b>impression</b> before it <b>fractures.</b> For subsequent measurements, the same position can therefore not be used. A special testing machine was designed to use the same set of anvils for testing more than one specimen. By each time positioning a particle at a slightly different position between the anvils, a large number of measurements could be made. The load required for fracture is almost independent of anvil hardness for very hard or very soft anvils. Finite element stress analysis showed that when the anvil hardness is very high, fracture occurs because of high local contact bending stresses at the point of contact. In the case of very soft anvils, a tensile stress develops along a latitudinal direction along the perimeter of the particle over a large volume in between the contact zones with the anvils. The particle then fractures by the development of cracks at right angles to the direction of the tensile stress. From the fracture load, the ability of the particle to withstand internal pressure can be assessed. The advantages of using compression testing of full particles between soft anvils without prior preparation to complement previous test methods are highlighted.

In all tests the least and greatest horizontal principal stresses (S_h and S_H, respectively) exceeded the vertical stress (S_ν), indicating a thrust faulting stress regime. A single good-quality hydraulic <b>fracture</b> <b>impression</b> from 309 m depth indicates an S_H direction of N 41 °E ± 10 °. This S_H direction should {{be interpreted with caution}} because it is based on only one observation. This orientation is fairly compatible with nearby surface stress measurements but is incompatible with most of the hydraulic fracturing stress orientations reported from comparable depths in the Mojave Desert and is not favorable for right-lateral slip on either the San Andreas fault or NW striking faults present farther to the east. The stress regime measured in the Black Butte hole is comparable to that measured at nearby shallow depths but differs from the strike-slip or transitional (strike-slip to thrust faulting) stress regime present at similar depths in two nearby holes: Crystallaire, 4 km northeast of fhe San Andreas fault, and Hi Vista, 32 km northeast of the San Andreas fault. The S_H direction measured in these holes is approximately 60 ° counterclockwise of that observed in the Black Butte hole.

40|$|Purpose Medial column {{fractures}} of {{the distal}} humerus are uncommon in adults. Among 26 patients {{identified in the}} English language literature, only 2 had articular fragmentation. We reviewed the experience of 2 trauma centers with isolated medial column fractures to evaluate our <b>impression</b> that these <b>fractures</b> often involve complex articular fragmentation. Methods There were 10 men and 4 women with am average age of 61 years (range, 44 - 86 years). The incidence was 3 % of all distal humerus fractures at one institution with a prospective fracture database. The mechanism of injury was a fall from standing height in most patients. There was one B 2. 1 fracture, 3 B 2. 2 fractures, 9 B 2. 3 (multifragmentary), and 1 C 3. 2 fracture. All patients were treated surgically; 7 were treated with an olecranon osteotomy. Eight patients had 1 or more postoperative complications and 5 patients underwent subsequent surgeries. Results We observed 11 patients {{for an average of}} 8 years (range, 14 months to 21 years). The are of ulnohumeral motion averaged 92 degrees, average flexion was 118 degrees, and average flexion contracture was 25 degrees. According to the Broberg and Morrey Functional Rating Index, the result was excellent in 4 patients, good in 6, and fair in 1. Six patients had arthrosis (3 grade 1 and 3 grade 2) according to the radiographic criteria of Broberg and Morrey. Conclusions Surgeons should be aware that the relatively uncommon medial column adult distal humerus fracture usually features complex articular fragmentation, but that satisfactory results can be obtained after open reduction and internal fixation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{different}} approaches of surface modifications on glass and p-aramid fibres were investigated {{and the consequences}} on the adhesion between reinforcing fibres and matrix material were evaluated by means of mechanical testing methods. The single-fibre fragmentation test (SFFT) a widely used micromechanical testing method was enhanced to allow a detailed characterisation of interphases in fibre-reinforced composites. A video based analysing method of the SFFT enables a direct monitoring of the fragmentation process of the embedded fibre. This permits to draw conclusions about the load transmission between matrix and fibre. With a second developed analysing method scanning and examination of a tested specimen at high magnification in different illumination modes is facilitated. This approach allows an exact identification and analysis of fibre failure types and interfacial phenomena. Differently surface treated glass fibres were investigated with the SFFT and based on investigated fragmentation processes as well as observed fibre failure types strong influences of the surface treatments on fibre-matrix adhesion were proven. In order to activate the fibre surface of p-aramid fibres washed or plasma treated fibres were dip-coated with quaternised polyethylenimine (PEI) -based primer polymers in an aqueous solution. Through electrokinetical measurements the adsorption behaviour of the synthesised PEI-derivatives was investigated and evaluated depending on pH, polymer concentration in the solution, fibre pretreatment and degree of quaternisation of the primer polymer. The mechanical characterisation of surface treated p-aramid fibres was performed with SFFTs and fibre bundle pull-out (BPO) tests. These mechanical tests illustrated the characteristic fracture behaviour of p-aramid fibres and identified it as disturbing factor for a distinct evaluation of the SFFT. The results of the BPO tests reflected the problematic observations of the SFFTs. However, analysis of the fracture surfaces of tested specimens gave a qualitative, visual <b>impression</b> of the <b>fracture</b> behaviour and indicated a slightly improved fibre-matrix adhesion for PEI-coated fibres in comparison to cleaned standard fibres. In another series of experiments p-aramid fibres were coated with poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) particles with the objective to enhance the adhesion and consequently also the load transmission between fibre and matrix. The optimal conditions for the coating procedure with nanoparticles were determined by performing coating experiments at varying conditions and subsequent electron microscopical analysis of the coated fibre material. A positive influence of the nanoparticles on fibre-matrix adhesion was demonstrated by means of SFFTs, BPO tests and tensile tests...|$|R
