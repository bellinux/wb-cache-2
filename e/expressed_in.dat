5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> human cells and 70% of these genes are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more {{specifically}} <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more {{specifically}} <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> the esophagus {{with less than}} 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E

These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> urine from those in other tissues.|$|E

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) {{contains}} five {{copies of}} the non-symbiotic hemoglobin (hb) gene, namely hb 1 to hb 5. Previous analysis by RT-PCR revealed that rice hb 1 <b>expresses</b> <b>in</b> roots and leaves and hb 2 <b>expresses</b> <b>in</b> leaves. However, {{it is not known}} whether or not hb 1 and hb 2 <b>express</b> <b>in</b> rice embryonic organs. Here, we report the expression of hb 1 and hb 2 genes in rice embryonic organs using RT-PCR and specific oligos for Hb 1 and Hb 2. Our results indicate that hb 1 and hb 2 genes <b>express</b> <b>in</b> embryonic organs in rice growing under normal conditions. Specifically, hb 1 <b>expresses</b> <b>in</b> rice embryos and seminal roots, and hb 2 <b>expresses</b> <b>in</b> embryos, coleoptiles and seminal roots. These observations suggest that Hb 1 and Hb 2 coexist and function in rice embryonic organs...|$|R
