40|$|Abstract. The {{stiffness}} {{analysis method}} considering uncertainty parameters of <b>frame</b> hydraulic <b>press</b> with movable eccentricity loading {{in the early}} design stage was proposed. The mathematical analytical stiffness of the upper beam with movable eccentricity loading was built. The adaptive Monte Carlo Method was {{used to calculate the}} interval of the stiffness with random parameters. The result shows that the stiffness appears higher when the eccentricity increasing. The approach has been tested by measuring the stiffness of a 10000 kN <b>frame</b> hydraulic <b>press</b> and a 15000 kN <b>frame</b> hydraulic <b>press...</b>|$|R

Silently and swiftly he crossed {{to the side of}} the sleeping man. The eye at the crack beside the gilded <b>frame</b> <b>pressed</b> closer to the aperture. The sword was raised above the body of the slumberer--its point hovered above his heart. The face of the man who wielded it was hard with firm resolve.|$|R

40|$|The {{porosity}} {{distribution and}} filtrate production during cake filtration in a plate-and-frame filter press were simulated mathematically. The model considered filtration that occurs after the filling process, not filtration that occurs as the suspension fills the cell. Governing equations for the temporal porosity distribution were developed for a plateand- <b>frame</b> <b>press.</b> The governing equations were solved numerically using an alternating-direction-implicit scheme. Appropriate initial and boundary conditions were determined based on {{characteristics of the}} plate-and-frame press and of the suspension properties. Predicted porosity and velocity distributions were calculated for assumed constitutive parameters...|$|R

50|$|Manual turret punches {{have also}} been used. These are C <b>frame</b> <b>presses,</b> usually with a rack-actuated ram. There is no CNC, for either sheet {{positioning}} or tool changing. Using such a manual press requires great familiarity, as the correct tool must be selected from the turret each time {{for every one of}} the many press operations performed. Such manual presses are rarely found, but they have their place in labour-intensive tasks such as hand-worked sheetmetal shops, making such products as custom car bodywork. They are often used in conjunction with other highly skilled artisan processes such as an English wheel.|$|R

[...] A replica of the Acorn press used to print the First Edition of the Book of Mormon in 1829 is on display at Brigham Young University-Idaho.After Smith’s death, Hoe and his sons renamed the company and worked on improving existing machinery.

50|$|The Walther P5 is a recoil-operated, locked-breech, 9 mm {{semi-automatic}} pistol. It utilizes {{the same}} design principles as the Walther P38 pistol of World War II fame. The barrel does not tilt following firing {{in the way}} that Browning's system does, but rather moves straight back approximately 5 mm. This system results in a very accurate pistol since the barrel is kept parallel with the frame during/after firing. The trigger is a standard double-action/single-action trigger. The slide lock also doubles as the decocker and is found {{on the left side of}} the <b>frame.</b> <b>Pressing</b> it once will release the slide, pressing it a second time will drop the hammer without firing the gun.|$|R

50|$|With {{both types}} of mount, springs are {{needed to keep the}} <b>frame</b> <b>pressed</b> against the ball bearings, unless the mount is {{designed}} to be used only in an orientation where gravity will keep the frame in place. Following the cantilever principle, a large mount allows finer control than a smaller one. The frames are ideally made of a light material, to make the resonant frequency of the structure high. This reduces vibration, since many common sources of vibration are relatively low frequency. For stability, the fixed frame is supported by a rigid mount that is securely bolted to a supporting surface. In a laboratory environment, this is typically an optical table. A shock can cause the mount {{to move away from the}} ball bearings, but because there are only 6, hard contacts, the mirror will return to the original position, preserving the alignment.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem is}} that Ethernet frames are about 1500 bytes in size—about 3 USB 2.0 packets, and 23 USB 1.1 packets. According how the USB system works, each packet is sent as a transfer, a series of maximum-length packets {{terminated}} by a short packet or a special ZLP (zero-length packet). After this, there is bus latency, where nothing is sent until another transfer can be initiated. This reduces bus occupancy, meaning that nothing is sent for considerable fractions of bus time. A <b>gap</b> every 23 <b>frames</b> is not noticeable, but a <b>gap</b> every three <b>frames</b> can be very costly to throughput.|$|R
50|$|The <b>frame</b> is <b>pressed</b> or stamped from {{sheet metal}} {{to form a}} car-type semi-monocoque. The frame may be entirely pressed (Ariel Arrow), or may have just a pressed aft section {{connected}} to the steering head by a conventional steel tubular spine (Honda Super Cub). Both the Super Cub and the Arrow also have pressed steel forks, instead of conventional telescopic forks.|$|R

40|$|This work used {{newspaper}} {{archives and}} content analysis to analyze two related hypotheses involving {{press coverage of}} UFW organizing activity. Hypothesis One: An increase in distance from the UFW???s strawberry organizing campaign in Watsonville, CA yields increased favorable press coverage of the campaign. As a co-dependent element, press coverage reflecting anti-grower <b>press</b> <b>frames</b> increases with distance from Watsonville, while press coverage closer to Watsonville reflects pro-grower <b>press</b> <b>frames.</b> Hypothesis Two: Higher county agricultural economic activity yields reduced favorable press coverage of the UFW campaign. As a co-dependent element, press coverage with a pro-grower <b>press</b> <b>frame</b> increases in counties with higher agricultural economic activity. These hypotheses created a framework for analyzing the content and perception of union organizing efforts in the press. Archival newspaper analysis from 1997 - 1998 confirmed both hypotheses but not their co-dependent elements. In the end, local press coverage of UFW???s strawberry worker campaign complicated and undercut the unionizing campaign in Watsonville...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{accessibility}} {{has long been}} theorized as a principal determinant of household residential choice behavior. Research on this influence is extensive but the empirical results have been mixed. Further, the measurement of accessibility must contend with complications arising from the increasing prevalence of trip-chains, non-work activities, and multi-worker households, as well as reconcile person-specific travel needs with household residential decisions. This paper {{contributes to the literature}} by addressing the <b>gap</b> <b>framed</b> by these issues and presents a novel residential choice model with three main elements of innovation. First, it operationalized a time-space prism (TSP) accessibility measure, which the authors believe to be the first application of its kind in a residential choice model. Second, it represented the choice sets in a building-level framework, the lowest level of spatial disaggregation available for modeling residential choices. Third, it explicitly examined the influence of non-work accessibility at both the local- and personal-level. This residential choice model was applied in the Puget Sound Region using a 2006 household activity survey. The model estimation results confirmed that accessibilit...|$|R

The gauge can then be used to draw the profile or to copy it on to another surface.|$|R

50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side <b>frame</b> <b>presses.</b> With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R
