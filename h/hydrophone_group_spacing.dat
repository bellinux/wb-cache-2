40|$|Abstract: Chirp sub-bottom {{profilers}} are marine {{acoustic devices}} that use a known and repeatable source signature (1 – 24 kHz) to produce decimetre vertical resolution cross-sections of the sub-seabed. Here {{the design and}} development of the first true 3 D Chirp system is described. When developing the design, critical factors that had to be considered included spatial aliasing, and precise positioning of sources and receivers. The design incorporates 4 source transducers (1. 5 – 13 kHz) that can be arranged into different configurations, including Maltese Cross, a square and two separated pairs. The receive array comprises 240 <b>hydrophones</b> in 60 <b>groups</b> whose group-centres are separated by 25 cm in both horizontal directions, with each <b>hydrophone</b> <b>group</b> containing four individual elements and a pre-amplifier. It was concluded {{that the only way to}} determine with sufficient accuracy the source-receiver geometry, was to fix the sources and receivers within a rigid array. Positional information for the array is given by a Real Time Kinematic GPS and attitude system incorporating four antennas to give position, heading, pitch and roll. The complete system is described and initial navigational and seismic data results are presented for a 3 D seismic volume over folded geological events within the West Solent (UK). These dat...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} sensor suites on board {{submarines}} the Passive Ranging Sonar (PRS) {{is a separate}} sensor, usually with three or more <b>hydrophone</b> <b>groups</b> {{on either side of}} the submarine. The aperture of this sensor is limited by the length of the boat, which makes ranging up to moderate distances possible. The combination of the towed and flank array sonar can be used to create a passive ranging sonar with a much larger acoustic aperture, resulting in a very long ranging capacity. Based on simulated data a calculation method was developed that combines adaptive beamformers, fine bearing estimation and a target localisation technique originating from an acoustic artillery ranging system. The method was evaluated on operational recordings of a towed and flank array sensor. If the target is detectable on both sensors, ranging can be performed instantaneous. The method is robust and can provide an increased passive ranging performance...|$|R

Nine replications of 21 (N = 189) gestating sows were used. At gestational d 35. 4 ± 2. 3, the pregnant sows were distributed into 3 pens of 7 sows, where they remained until 104. 6 ± 3. 5 d. Each treatment pen had 7 free-access stalls and a <b>group</b> <b>space</b> that together provided 1. 93 (SS), 2. 68 (IS), or 3. 24 (LS) m 2 /sow. Baseline measurements were obtained before mixing. Back fat depth, BW, BCS, and lameness were measured monthly, and skin lesions were scored weekly. Blood was collected monthly for hematological, immunological, and cortisol analyses. Sow behavior was video recorded continuously during the initial 4 d of treatment and 24 h every other week thereafter. Behavior was analyzed for location, posture, pen investigation, social contact, and aggression. Skin response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was tested at mean gestational d 106. Litter characteristics including size and weight were collected at birth and weaning. The {{data were analyzed using}} a mixed model. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with the Tukey-Kramer and Bejamini-Hochberg methods. <b>Group</b> <b>space</b> allowance had no effect on any measure of sow health, physiology, or production (P ≥ 0. 10). Sows in the SS, IS, and LS pens spent 77. 88 % ± 3. 88 %, 66. 02 % ± 3. 87 %, and 63. 64 % ± 3. 91 %, respectively, of their time in the free-access stalls (P = 0. 12). However, SS sows used the <b>group</b> <b>space</b> less than IS and LS sows (P = 0. 01). Overall, pen investigatory behavior was not affected by <b>group</b> <b>space</b> allowance (P = 0. 91). Sows in the LS pens spent more time in a social group than SS sows (P = 0. 02), whereas sows in IS pens were intermediate to, but not different from, the other treatments (P ≥ 0. 10). The size of the social groups was also affected by the <b>group</b> <b>space</b> allowance (P = 0. 03), with SS sows forming smaller groups than LS sows; again, IS sows were intermediate to, but not different from, the other treatments. Although the <b>group</b> <b>space</b> allowance had no measurable impact on the health, physiology, or productivity of the sows, the lower <b>group</b> <b>space</b> use and social contact of the SS sows reduced the behavioral diversity benefits of group housing and may indicate an avoidance of social stressors or a lack of physical comfort in the smallest pens...|$|R
