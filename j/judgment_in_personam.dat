25|$|The {{due process}} clause “does not {{contemplate}} {{that a state}} may make binding a <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations.” Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another state, even if the forum state has {{a strong interest in}} applying its law to the controversy, and even if the forum state is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause may sometimes act to divest the state of its power to render a valid judgment.|$|E
50|$|The issue {{involved}} {{a determination of}} the level of connection that must exist between a non-resident corporation and a state in order for that corporation to be sued within that state. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone (and in which Justice Robert Jackson did not participate), held that in view of 26 U.S.C. § 1606(a) (providing that no person shall be relieved from compliance with a state law requiring payments to an unemployment fund on the ground that he is engaged in interstate commerce) the fact that the corporation is engaged in interstate commerce does not relieve it from liability for payments to the state unemployment compensation fund. The activities in behalf of the corporation render it amenable to suit in courts of the State to recover payments due to the state unemployment compensation fund. The activities in question established sufficient contacts or ties between the State and the corporation to make it reasonable and just, and in conformity to the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, for the State to enforce against the corporation an obligation arising out of such activities. In such a suit to recover payments due to the unemployment compensation fund, service of process upon one of the corporation's salesmen within the State, and notice sent by registered mail to the corporation at its home office, satisfies the requirements of due process. The tax imposed by the state unemployment compensation statute - construed by the state court, in its application to the corporation, as a tax on the privilege of employing salesmen within the State - does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In reaching its decision the Court stated that throughout American history, the jurisdiction of courts to render <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> has been grounded on their de facto power over the defendant's person. Hence, his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding him. But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that, in order to subject a defendant to a <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Justice Hugo Black wrote a separate opinion, agreeing with the outcome in this case, but contending that the Court has excessively restricted the power of states to find jurisdiction over companies doing business therein.|$|E

Nebraska remains one of the few states that continue to use procedural statutes based on the Field Code, and its class action statute, section 25 - 319 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes, is almost identical to the class action provision of the Field Code. This article will first briefly discuss the historical development of class actions. It will then analyze the Nebraska statute and relevant case law, with particular emphasis on the types of class actions that are maintainable under Nebraska law. This article shows that the Nebraska class action statute is much more restrictive than Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and has seldom been applied by the Nebraska Supreme Court in a manner favorable to the plaintiff...|$|E
40|$|Rule 40 (1) of Dicey, Morris and Collins 1 {{reads as}} follows: A court {{of a foreign}} country has {{jurisdiction}} to give a <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> rem capable of enforcement or recognition in England if the {{subject-matter of the proceedings}} wherein that judgment was given was immovable or movable property which was {{at the time of the}} proceedings situate in that country. Its application seems to be simple enough. But the commentary to r 40 warns us, “[t]he question whether a foreign <b>judgment</b> is <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> or <b>in</b> rem is sometimes a difficult one on which English judges have been divided in opinion”. This warning, however, still falls rather short. As two opinions recently handed down by the Privy Council illustrate, r 40 (1) raises two distinct issues: one, whether for purposes of recognition or enforcement, a foreign judgment is to be characterized as being in rem or <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> and two, whether the foreign “judgment” is a judgment at all...|$|R

40|$|This Article takes a {{fresh look}} at the power of courts and {{creditors}} to force debtors to repay their obligations through <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> collection techniques. Variously known as “debtor’s examinations,” “turnover orders,” “citations to discover assets,” “supplementary proceedings,” “proceedings supplementary,” and “proceedings in aid of execution,” <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> remedies force the debtor, under threat of the court’s contempt authority, to turn over money or property directly to a creditor. Because the exercise of the court’s contempt authority can result in a debtor’s imprisonment, <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> techniques have long been regarded as a critical but potentially very coercive arrow in a debt collector’s quiver. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission and others have endorsed major changes to a debt collection system labeled as “broken. ” These reform proposals, however, have overlooked key problems <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings, where excessive creditor leverage and insufficient protection of debtors’ procedural rights risk validating a view that the judicial system is functioning as creditors’ private collection arm. Following the transfer of power to a newly established Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this Article resurrects a subject that has received virtually no attention in the scholarly literature for over a decade. It analyzes the particular features of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings and debtor behavior that contribute to a longstanding imbalance in the leverage asserted by creditors over debtors. The Article recommends specific changes to the way courts conduct <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings to ensure that the in terrorem effects of these remedies do not upend important social policies, including the protection of exempt property and the adjudicative fairness of the collection process. Debt collection is a fundamental component of the consumer credit system. The strength and legitimacy of its procedures, however, depend on maintaining a difficult balance between the state’s and creditors’ interest <b>in</b> rigorous <b>judgment</b> enforcement and debtors’ interest in imposing reasonable limitations on the coerciveness of debt collection...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{maturing}} of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim, and its relationship with the concepts of supervening fraud and landlocked land. The paper concentrates solely on the enforcement of the claim against the class of registered owners and uses two decisions concerning a sub‐set of that class — the access‐blocking owner — to tease out the principles. The claim will supersede supervening fraud, a principle that may be neither 'necessary [nor] consistent with the statute'. The circumstances in which claims <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> are, and will be, recognised are wide. This paper highlights well‐established known legal or equitable causes of action to which the unconscionability of a registered owner may attach. The claim's relationship with ss 326 ‐ 331 of the Property Law Act 2007 adds a further dimension to the debate. So how do the parties fare under the three concepts? Both the Suttons and the McGraths clear the hurdles of supervening fraud and the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim. Had they resided in New Zealand, the McGraths would probably have successfully defended a landlocked land application from the Campbells. However, Mr O'Kane would have dealt his winning card and, pursuant to ss 326 ‐ 330 of the Property Law Act 2007, his access would have been reinstated. A tricky trio indeed...|$|R
