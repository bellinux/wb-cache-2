40|$|In literature, pumps {{which are}} known as {{vertical}} turbine pump (VTP) {{have been designed to}} work vertically. Today, they {{are known as}} <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps. These pumps are especially used in narrow and very <b>deep</b> <b>wells</b> where the surface sources are insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to select suitable stage number to benefit from <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps efficiently. In this study, a new <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pump has been designed and the performances of three stage <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps have been investigated experimentally using different number of blades. Efficiency increase ratio of these three stage <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps has been determined at the best efficiency point with respect to single stage <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a novel approach}} to containing and removing toxic waste from a subsurface environment. More specifically {{the present invention relates}} to a system for containing and removing volatile toxic chemicals from a subsurface environment using differences in surface and subsurface pressures. The present embodiment generally comprises a <b>deep</b> <b>well,</b> a horizontal tube, at least one injection well, at least one extraction well and a means for containing the waste within the waste zone (in-situ barrier). During operation the <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> air at the bottom of well (which is at a high pressure relative to the land surface as well as relative to the air in the contaminated soil) flows upward through the <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> (or <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> tube). This stream of <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> air is directed into the horizontal tube, down through the injection tube(s) (injection well(s)) and into the contaminate plume where it enhances volatization and/or removal of the contaminants...|$|R

50|$|There are 2,299 {{households}} or 26.80% {{that take}} their drinking {{water from a}} tube/pipe well (jetmatic/pitcher pump) for private use of the household, 637 household or 11.87 takes their water from a <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> of another household or establishment or from a <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> constructed for public use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>well</b> {{pumps are}} those in which the jet {{is located at the}} bottom of the well. The maximum depth for <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pumps is {{determined}} by the inside diameter of and the velocity through the jet. The major advantage of jet pumps for <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> installations is the ability to situate all mechanical parts (e.g., electric/petrol motor, rotating impellers) at the ground surface for easy maintenance. The advent of the electrical submersible pump has partly replaced the need for jet type well pumps, except for driven point wells or surface water intakes.|$|R
40|$|The {{project scope}} was {{to install a}} diesel {{generated}} power source to <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> 4 {{in addition to the}} existing commercial power source. The diesel power source and its fuel supply system shall be seismically qualified to withstand a Performance Category 4 (PC- 4) seismic event. This diesel power source will permit the <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> to operate during a loss of commercial power. System design will incorporate the ability to select and transfer power between the new diesel power source and commercial power sources for the the <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> motor and TRA- 672 building loads...|$|R
