40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the pricing efficiency of <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> markets by applying the framework of the price decision support system (PDSS). The Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market, in Taiwan, is a case used to illustrate this procedure. We first established a simulation model for the operation of the Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market, including all possible factors that may affect the auction time. Secondly, we setup a regression model for auction pricing and auction time of each section from the results of the model. Using this information, we established a PDSS for the Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market to help decision-makers improve pricing functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|There are {{two main}} {{research}} tasks for internet auction between <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> markets in this project. One is to analyze why suppliers, sellers, and workers in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> markets accept or reject the implementation of internet auction for fish. And a bar-code system will be developed {{for all kinds of}} fish under this main task. The other main task is to give suggestions about what kind of software and hardware should be added in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> markets to improve their process efficiencies. At last, we will provide an action plan which contains the key issues and steps of implementing internet auction for the <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> markets. 本研究主要分為兩大方面針對網路連線拍賣之基礎工作進行相關研究, 一為通路成員間研究: 其研究內容包括管理面的探討, 如: 成員間的拆帳方式、配送模式等. 此外, 魚產品如何改變以適合在網路上銷售及如何應用條碼來輔助整體作業效率提昇、資訊流通也是研究範圍. 二為魚市場內作業流程的研究: 可從流程管理的角度來讓魚市場內的作業符合電子化的精神, 即提昇內部作業效率、降低成本. 最後, 也將提供政府一網路連線拍賣之行動計畫書及建議, 作為日後進行此項建設之參考方向...|$|R

40|$|Summary Two {{opposing}} views {{exist in}} the literature on the potential role that international <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> plays in economic development. While some claim that <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> has a pro-poor effect, others denounce the negative effect of fish export on local populations' food security and doubt its contributions to the macro-economy. In this paper, we explore this debate in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis did not find any evidence of direct negative impact of <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> on food security; neither did it find evidence that international <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> generates positive, pro-poor outcomes. This paper discusses the possible reasons for this apparent lack of development impact and highlights the unsupported assumptions underlying the current discourse about international <b>fish</b> <b>trade.</b> We suggest that, given lack of evidence for the development benefits of <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> between Africa and developed countries, fisheries policy could consider support for regional (Africa-to-Africa) trade that meets the growing African demand for lower-value fish. Means of overcoming barriers to intra-African <b>trade</b> in <b>fish</b> are discussed. food security international <b>fish</b> <b>trade</b> poverty reduction small-scale fisheries Africa...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{operational}} costs of the Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market in Taiwan, using both the activity-based costing (ABC) model and the simulation technique. By using simulation results in the calculated model of ABC, allocated resource costs are more accurate and arbitrary allocation is avoided. The objective of this study is to compute the processing cost per kilogram of fish. We conclude by providing relevant and accurate information about cost management of the Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market, comparing ABC with traditional costing methods, and discussing key related issues which may provide opportunities for future research. We believe that the use of the ABC model in conjunction with simulation techniques can also be applied to agricultural systems in other countries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
