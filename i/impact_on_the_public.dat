5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> debate there.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} firm Ellerbe Becket, {{in association with}} Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000sqft(140,000m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor Husky Stadium. His goal {{was to create a}} similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue. The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14months by Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects while First & Goal managed the construction. Town meetings were held to discuss the <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> and the company created a $6million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo {{taken of the}} aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page}} of the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

25|$|The Hosokawa {{government}} {{pushed for}} changes to Japanese election laws intended to fight political corruption, including elimination of corporate political donations to individual candidates and a redrawing {{of the electoral}} system, both intended to prevent the LDP from continuing to employ its past electoral practices. After an extended legislative fight, the LDP was able to force several concessions to maintain their advantage, retaining corporate political donations with a cap, while pushing back on some more radical changes to the electoral map and ensuring that most candidates would keep essentially the same seats in the next election. These compromises had a negative <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> approval of the Hosokawa coalition.|$|E

In devising strategies to manage and minimize these impacts, gaining an in-depth understanding about timing and spatial extents of them is crucial. However, in practice gaining such understanding is difficult due to the complex and varying nature of the impacts. To support project planners with understanding a highway construction project's impacts upfront, we developed a 4 D modeling method that visualizes the most important attributes of <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> namely their spatial extents and their progression over time.

[...] Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome, stating, [...] "The old, the ugly or the unwanted is simply made to disappear through a manhole".

500|$|The show's {{research}} {{staff and}} producers conducted regularly-scheduled internal reviews and seminars {{to ensure that}} their curriculum goals were being met and to guide future production. As of 2001, ten seminars had been conducted specifically to address the literacy needs of preschool children. Curriculum seminars prior to Sesame Street's 33rd season in 2002 resulted in a change from the show's magazine-like format to a more narrative format. There have been over 1,000 studies as of 2001 which examine the show's impact on children's learning and attention. Most of these studies were conducted by the CTW and remain unpublished. The most important studies that found negative effects of Sesame Street were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> discussion about Sesame Street. Another criticism was made by journalist Kay Hymowitz in 1995, who reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW [...] "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".|$|E
