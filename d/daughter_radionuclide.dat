The quantity of radionuclide B builds up until the number of B atoms decaying per unit time becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time; the quantity of radionuclide B then reaches a constant, equilibrium value.

30|$|In {{cases where}} no natural {{affinity}} of the α-emitting mother radionuclide {{to the target}} tissue can be exploited there are essentially three strategies to directly use the long-lived mother radionuclide in the decay chain for therapy (de Kruijff et al., 2015). (i) Local application: The compound must be applied locoregionally in a compartment with no or sufficiently slow exchange with the surrounding {{in order to ensure}} that no <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> may infiltrate blood circulation until the stable nuclide at the end of the decay chain is formed. (ii) Internalisation: If the vectors with the long-lived α-emitters are internalised by the target cells, the cell volume is usually large enough to keep all recoiling <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> inside the target cells (McDevitt et al., 2001). This explains why the use of 225 Ac bound to a targeting molecule by complexation has shown therapeutic efficacy without significant toxicity (Kratochwil et al., 2016). Carrier-mediated internalization was efficacious in vitro and in vivo for the targeted cells and limited the toxicity to non-target cells (Zhu et al., 2016). (iii) Encapsulation: The third option, discussed here, is to encapsulate the mother radionuclide in a nanoparticle that is big enough to physically confine all recoils in the decay chain in its structure. Such a nanoparticle requires a suitable size and structure and should allow an adequate surface functionalisation to enable systemic administration and efficient tissue targeting.|$|R

Furthermore, there was also some retention of free 223 Ra in tumor. This is a small ion with several α-emitting <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> that might surmount the macromolecular transport barriers of solid tumors and result in high LET α-irradiation of tumor cells not reached by the larger molecule 227 Th-trastuzumab.

This survey was undertaken {{to better understand}} the radioactivity content of the modern diet and also to assess the suitability of the current use of milk as a sentinel for dietary radionuclide trends. Thirteen radionuclides were analysed in 40 common food commodities, including animal products, fruits, vegetables, cereal grains and seafood.

The random walk model for recoiling daughter nuclides in α-particle cascades provides an estimate for {{the size of an}} idealised spherical nanoparticle assuming that the radionuclide is localized in a very small core nanoparticle surrounded by a concentric shell structure that confines the recoiling α-emitting <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> Nanoparticle agglomeration is a main obstacle for the experimental verification of the model as well as for efficient tumour targeting. However, when optimising nanoparticles for targeted therapy their size is only one parameter that needs to be considered together with the ease of surface functionalisation, the time required for accumulation in tumour tissue, and the interaction with tumour cells. Fast tumour accumulation and rapid internalisation of the carrier by tumour cells may justify the use of smaller nanocarriers compromising the retention of daughter nuclides in the α-particle emission cascade. The presented random walk model could be used to estimate how much non-targeted α-particle activity may be expected when reducing nanoparticle size.|$|R

40|$|This article {{continues}} {{from the earlier}} article "An Introduction to Nuclear Medicine" where the general principles of nuclear medicine were discussed. Radionuclides are required in both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. Naturally occurring radionuclides are generally not suitable for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures due to their typically long half-lives or less than ideal physical or chemical characteristics; therefore appropriate radionuclides need to be produced. The common methods of radionuclide production for nuclear medicine include: fission, neutron activation, cyclotron and generator. Fission occurs in a nuclear reactor where neutrons are used to bombard fission nuclides such as uranium- 235 (235 U) or plutonium- 239 (239 Pu). Fission results in the splitting of the large nucleus into smaller fission fragments along {{with the release of}} gamma radiation and high energy neutrons. Neutron activation also takes place in a nuclear reactor. The neutrons are used to bombard stable nuclides to form other radionuclides. There are disadvantages with this process so other production means are oft en preferred. Cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles such as protons (p), deuterons (d), triton (t) and alpha (alpha) particles to high velocities to penetrate the orbital electrons of the target atom and interact with the nucleus. Generators produce the most commonly used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, technetium- 99 m (99 mTc). The radionuclide generator sees the decay of a long half-life parent radionuclide to a short half-life <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide.</b> The daughter is the radionuclide used in nuclear medicine.

Unfortunately, a broader use of α-particle emitting radionuclides is hampered by the following issues: (i) With very few exceptions, α-particle emitting radionuclides are not readily available and are therefore still expensive. This issue has been reviewed by various authors (Seidl, 2014; Elgqvist et al., 2014), and technologies have been developed that could enable practically unlimited supply if a substantial commercial demand is once established (Apostolidis et al., 2005; Weidner et al., 2012). (ii) Adequate α-particle emitting radionuclides are either too short-lived for most targeting approaches or they are sufficiently long-lived but exhibit a complex α-particle-emission cascade (Elgqvist et al., 2014; Couturier et al., 2005). In the case of α-emitters with a short half-life of one hour or less, the first successful targeting using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was restricted to leukemic cells that could be reached by mAbs within minutes after intravenous injection (Aghevlian et al., 2017; Allen, 2013) and to locoregional applications. (iii) Longer-lived α-emitters exhibit complex decay chains in which the daughter radionuclides receive high recoil energies of typically about 100 keV when the α-particle is emitted. This energy is about four orders of magnitude higher than any chemical binding energy, which means that the <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> cannot be hold by a chemical bond. Therefore, when using bifunctional ligands, the daughter nuclide will be released, may reach the blood stream, will be displaced and cause off-target toxicity (de Kruijff et al., 2015; Jaggi et al., 2005).|$|E

30|$|Based on the recoil {{energies}} {{we can now}} {{determine the}} range of the recoils in various materials that are currently considered as drug carriers in nanomedicine. For this purpose the simulation software SRIM (Ziegler et al., 2013) was used. For simplicity, when simulating the ion ranges in liposomes or polymeric nanoparticles, we replaced the carrier material by using water as stopping medium with a density of 1 g⋅cm- 3 which is close to the density of most polymer materials. The recoil ranges determined in this way are reported in Table 2. The results show that recoil ranges of the various recoiling daughter nuclides are very similar for a given nanoparticle material, for example, in gold they are typically around 12 nm. Therefore, a nanoparticle that carries α-particle emitters in its center and is surrounded by a gold layer of 36 nm should retain all radionuclides up to the third daughter. Assuming a nucleus diameter of (3 - 5) nm housing the radioactive payload in the nanoparticle, the diameter of a gold-encapsulated α-particle nanogenerator should not exceed approximately 75 nm before surface functionalization. Similarly, when using 230 U, gold nanoparticles with diameters as small as about 50 nm in diameter could ensure safe confinement of all <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> up to 222 Ra.|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{increasing}} the performance of radionuclide generators used in nuclear medicine radiotherapy and SPECT/PET imaging were developed and detailed for 99 Mo/ 99 mTc and 68 Ge/ 68 Ga radionuclide generators as the cases. Optimisation methods of the daughter nuclide build-up versus stand-by time and/or specific activity using mean progress functions were developed for increasing the performance of radionuclide generators. As {{a result of this}} optimisation, the separation of the daughter nuclide from its parent one should be performed at a defined optimal time to avoid the deterioration in specific activity of the daughter nuclide and wasting stand-by time of the generator, while the daughter nuclide yield is maintained to a reasonably high extent. A new characteristic parameter of the formation-decay kinetics of parent/daughter nuclide system was found and effectively used in the practice of the generator production and utilisation. A method of “early elution schedule” was also developed for increasing the daughter nuclide production yield and specific radioactivity, thus saving the cost of the generator and improving the quality of the <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> solution. These newly developed optimisation methods in combination with an integrated elution-purification-concentration system of radionuclide generators recently developed is the most suitable way to operate the generator effectively on the basis of economic use and improvement of purposely suitable quality and specific activity of the produced daughter radionuclides. All these features benefit the economic use of the generator, the improved quality of labelling/scan, and the lowered cost of nuclear medicine procedure. Besides, a new method of quality control protocol set-up for post-delivery test of radionuclidic purity has been developed based on the relationship between gamma ray spectrometric detection limit, required limit of impure radionuclide activity and its measurement certainty with respect to optimising decay/measurement time and product sample activity used for QC quality control. The optimisation ensures a certainty of measurement of the specific impure radionuclide and avoids wasting the useful amount of valuable purified/concentrated daughter nuclide product. This process is important for the spectrometric measurement of very low activity of impure radionuclide contamination in the radioisotope products of much higher activity used in medical imaging and targeted radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBehavior of Sr- 90 {{radionuclide}} in {{the system}} of «soil-plants-mollusc shells» was investigated on the example of biotope of regional radioactive waste storage facility. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the possibility of applying the conceptual model of zonality of chronic effects of ionizing radiation in natural populations in the investigation of behavior of radioactive strontium in terrestrial ecosystems and to identify radioecological zones of biological effects of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation of the mollusc population based on of the bio-geochemical regularities of technogenic migration of Sr- 90 within the «soil-plants-mollusc shells» system. The study was conducted on the experimental site which represented the biotope of the regional radioactive waste storage facility. Analysis of samples of soil, plant (Urtica dioica) and terrestrial molluscs was implemented by the method of radiochemical separation followed with measuring the activity of the radionuclide using scintillation spectrometer «BETA- 01 C». Annual exposures to external beta-radiation received by tissues of molluscs irradiated by Sr- 90 and its <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> Y- 90 contained in the shells were calculated using Levinger and Marinelli formula.

40|$|The minor isotope 232 U may {{ultimately}} {{be used for}} detection or confirmation of uranium {{in a variety of}} applications. The primary advantage of 232 U as an indicator of the presence of enriched uranium is the plentiful and penetrating nature of the radiation emitted by its <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 208 Tl. A possible drawback to measuring uranium via 232 U is the relatively high uncertainty in 232 U abundance both within and between material populations. An important step in assessing this problem is to ascertain what determines the 232 U concentration within any particular sample of uranium. To this end, we here analyze the production and eventual enrichment of 232 U during fuel-cycle operations. The goal of this analysis is to allow approximate prediction of 232 U quantities, or at least some interpretation of the results of 232 U measurements. We have found that 232 U is produced via a number of pathways during reactor irradiation of uranium and is subsequently concentrated during the later enrichment of the uranium' s 235 U Content. While exact calculations are nearly impossible for both the reactor-production and cascade-enrichment parts of the prediction problem, estimates and physical bounds can be provided as listed below and detailed within the body of the report. Even if precise calculations for the irradiation and enrichment were possible, the ultimate 212 U concentration would still depend upon the detailed fuel-cycle history. Assuming that a thennal-diffusion cascade is used to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), dilution of reactor-processed fuel at the cascade input and the long-term holdup of 232 U within the cascade both affect the 232 U concentration in the product. Similar issues could be expected to apply for the other isotope-separation technologies that are used in other countries. Results of this analysis are listed below: 0 The 232 U concentration depends strongly on the uranium enrichment, with depleted uranium (DU) containing between 1600 and 8000 times less 232 U than HEU does. * The 236 U/ 232 U concentration ratio in HEU is likely to be between 10 {sup 6 } and 2 x 10 {sup 7 }. 0 Plutonium-production reactors yield uranium with between I and 10 ppt of 232 u. 0 Much higher 132 U concentrations can be obtained in some situations. * Significant variation in the 232 U concentration is inevitable. * Cascade enrichment increases the 232 U concentration by a factor of at least 200, and possibly as much as 1000. 0 The actual 232 U concentration depends upon the dilution at the cascade input...|$|E

There are currently several metastatic-targeted agents radiolabeled with various therapeutic radionuclides which are in various stages of clinical investigation. Since neutron rich radionuclides are produced in research reactors and often decay by emission of beta(-) particles, most radionuclides used for bone pain palliation are reactor-produced. Key examples of radionuclides produced by single neutron capture of enriched targets include rhenium- 186 and samarium- 153. In addition, generator systems are also of interest which provide therapeutic <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> from the decay of reactor-produced parent radionuclides.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a radiation detection device so sensitive that a decay rate of only one atom per 11. 57 days per kilogram of material could be detected. Such a detector is needed for screening materials that will be used in exotic high energy physics experiments currently being planned for the near future. The research was performed deep underground at the Underground Mine State Park in Soudan, Minnesota. The overburden there is ~ 1800 meters water equivalent. The reason for performing the research at such depth was to vastly reduce the effects of cosmic radiation. The flux of muons and fast neutrons is about 100, 000 times lower than at the surface. A small clean room quality lab building was constructed so that work could be performed in such a manner that radioactive contamination could be kept at a minimum. Glove boxes filled with dry nitrogen gas were used to further reduce contamination from dirt and also help reduce the concentration of the radioactive gas 222 Ra and <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> which are normally present in air. A massive lead shield (about 20 tons) was constructed in such a manner that an eight inch cube of space in the center was available for the sample and detector. The innermost 4 " thick lead walls were made of ~ 460 year old lead previously used in double beta decay experiments and known to be virtually free of 210 Pb. A one and one half inch thick shell of active plastic scintillator was imbedded {{in the center of the}} 16 " thick lead walls, ceiling, and floor of the shield and is used to help reduce activity due to the few muons and fast neutrons seen at this depth. The thick lead shielding was necessary to shield the detector from gamma rays emitted by radionuclides in the rock walls of the mine. A sealable chamber was constructed and located on top of the shield that included a device for raising and lowering the detector and samples into and out of the center chamber of the shield. A plastic scintillator detector measuring 6 "x 6 "x 6 " was fitted with wave length shifting fibers that allowed the light from ionizing radiation to be collected and transmitted outside the massive shield to photomultiplier tubes and electronics. The detector was calibrated for energy and detection efficiency and low resolution background spectra were collected. Results from these measurements show the figure of merit (using: efficiency/square root of background) for this plastic scintillation counting technique to be ~ 15 times better than for a 2 kg germanium detector for measuring surface contamination from atmospheric 222 Rn daughters (210 Pb, 210 Bi, and 210 Po). These <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> are normally deposited everywhere onto all materials exposed to air. The results are encouraging and indicate that plastic scintillation counting techniques can be of benefit to the public by making available very sensitive counters for screening ultra-low background materials at an affordable cost.

The radioactivity from <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> generated by uranium decays. Apparently, the much higher radioactivity in this kind of solid waste may present a potential danger to the ambient environment and human health. However, the recovery of uranium as resources and removal of radioactivity were rarely studied. The distribution and occurrence of uranium in CBA were studied. The experimental results show that uranium mainly exists as incorporated into aluminosilicates (mainly glass phase) (59. 1 %) and Fe-oxides (34. 9 %). The extraction of uranium was achieved by Tessier sequential extraction, acid leaching, magnetic separation, mechanical activation combined with alkali activation, as well as calcination with Cacl 2 followed by HNO 3 leaching. The results demonstrated that the optimal method of extraction uranium was calcination with Cacl 2 followed by leaching with HNO 3. By this method, the recovery of uranium can be as high as up to 95. 8 %, and removal of gross α and gross β can reach 92. 9 % and 84. 9 %, respectively. The possible mechanism of uranium recovery by Cacl 2 roasting followed by HNO 3 leaching was also investigated in this work. After processing, the radioactive CBA can meet the requirement of the standard of limit on radioactive substance for industrial waste slags used in building materials. It can be concluded that the method of Cacl 2 roasting followed by HNO 3 leaching can be used for the resource-oriented utilization of radioactive CBA...|$|R
30|$|McLaughlin et al. (2013) state a {{de facto}} {{quantitative}} retention of 225 Ac and of about 90 % of 221 Fr after 3 weeks in [La,Gd]PO 4 nanoparticles with a diameter of 27 nm. In an earlier work, Woodward et al. (2011) state about 40 % retention of 221 Fr in [225 Ac]LaPO 4 nanoparticles with a diameter of 3 - 5 nm after 25 days. The range of recoiling of 221 Fr in LaPO 4 and GdPO 4 is about 20 nm. Thus, in both cases one would not expect such a high retention of 221 Fr. In {{the case of the}} small 3 - 5 nm sized nanoparticles the authors suggest that a part of the recoil energy may be transferred to the whole entity of the nanoparticle (Woodward et al., 2011). This is however highly unlikely since a 5 nm nanoparticle, whose weight was specified by the authors with M 2 = 200 kDa, would be much heavier than a 221 Fr atom with M 1 = 221 Da, which renders the energy fraction transferred to the nanoparticle approximately M 1 /(M 1 +M 2) ≈ 10 - 3. The authors did not describe the mechanisms of such a transfer in detail. However, the simulation software SRIM (Ziegler et al., 2013) takes already into account all conceivable types of interactions between energetic ions and the host material in which they are slowed down, as for example head-on collisions of the recoils with atoms of the host material leading to collision cascades and atomic displacements of secondary ions, electronic and phononic excitations. Finally, all processes by which ions lose kinetic energy in bulk matter lead to the production of heat and defects in the crystal lattice. Therefore, {{it will be difficult to}} hypothesize a process that allows a partial transfer of momentum and energy from the recoiling <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> to the entity of a nanoparticle. A much simpler explanation for the higher than expected retention could be based on nanoparticle agglomeration, where the 221 Fr that escapes one nanoparticle is implanted in an adjacent one and finally retained there. Radiolabelling of nanoparticles by recoil implantation of radioactive atoms has been applied routinely by one of the present authors (e.g. Holzwarth et al., 2014). Recoil implantation may even explain the 40 % of 221 Fr retention in perfectly dispersed 3 - 5 nm sized [225 Ac]LaPO 4 nanoparticles. With the information given by Woodward et al. (2011) (600 μCi 225 Ac, one 225 Ac atom in 30 nanoparticles and dispersion volume 0.5 mL) it is possible to estimate the number and mean distance of the nanoparticles used for this leaching experiment. One obtains a mean distance of the nanoparticles of about 85 nm which equals the range of the 105 keV 221 Fr in water. A detailed SRIM simulation assuming 221 Fr is emitted from the centre of a 4 nm sized LaPO 4 nanoparticle and passing 85 nm in water gives a residual kinetic energy slightly higher than 1 keV, which is sufficient to implant it again in a depth of 2 nm below a LaPO 4 surface. Thus, using a slightly lower concentration might have shown the expected non-retention of 221 Fr in so small nanoparticles or would have supported the more likely hypothesis of a certain degree of nanoparticle agglomeration.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Two {{isotopes}} of scandium, 47 Sc and 44 Sc, are perspective radionuclides respectively for radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging. 47 Sc decays {{with the}} half-life of 3. 35 days and maximum β- energy of 600 keV. It also emits low-energy γ-radiation (Eγ = 159 keV) suitable for simultaneous imaging. The other scandium radionuclide - 44 Sc (t 1 / 2 = 3. 92 h) {{is an ideal}} β+-emitter in PET diagnosis. It can be used instead of 68 Ga, because 44 Sc has longer half-life and forms stable radiobioconjugates with a structure similar to 90 Y and 177 Lu, what is important in planning radionuclide therapy [1]. 44 Sc can be obtained as a <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> of long-lived 44 Ti (t 1 / 2 = 60. 4 y) from 44 Ti/ 44 Sc generator or can be produced by nuclear reaction 44 Ca (p, n) 44 Sc in small cyclotrons. The aim of our work was to find optimal parameters for 44 CaCO 3 target irradiation {{in order to maximize}} production of 44 Sc with minimal impurities of longer-lived 44 mSc and development of simple chemical procedure for separation of 44 Sc from the calcium target. Methods: The irradiation of enriched 44 CaCO 3 Isoflex (Russia) was performed with the Scanditronix MC 40 Cyclotron Joint Research Centre (Ispra, Italy). In stack target, 2 mg of enriched CaCO 3 in aluminum foil envelop were used together with Cu disk as beam current monitor. The copper monitor was positioned in entrance of the stack which allowed to have an accurate measurement of the proton beam current by measuring the 44 Sc activity. The stack-foil target was irradiated in aluminum capsules inserted in a holder that allowed direct water cooling from the rear and the front side. Longer-lived 46 Sc was used instead of 44 Sc in the separation procedure. The CaCO 3 target (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0. 1 M HCl. Next, the solution was passed through the small column filled with iminodiacetic resin Chelex- 100. After adsorption of 46 Sc the column was washed with 30 ml of 0. 01 M HCl and the effluent containing enriched calcium was collected for further irradiations. The 46 Sc was quantitatively eluted with 1 M HCl in the second 0. 5 ml fraction. Results: The 44 CaCO 3 target was irradiated by protons in the range of 5. 5 - 23 MeV. The analysis of several irradiations indicate that the amount of 44 Sc obtained is maximal with minimal (0. 16 %) 44 mSc impurity in the energy range of 9 - 10 MeV. 46 Sc was separated from the target on iminodiacetic resin with efficiency of more than 95 %, eluted in volume of 0. 5 ml. The recovery of the calcium target is nearly quantitative. The level of Ca 2 + in 46 Sc fraction is less than 3 g/ml. Conclusions: The low-energy irradiation of 44 Ca gives opportunity to produce Ci level activities of 44 Sc. The separation process proposed of 44 Sc from the target is simple and fast. The 44 Sc obtained can be used instead of 68 Ga in PET diagnosis and planning radionuclide receptor therapy [...] Research Support: This work was carried out {{as a part of the}} project of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland DWM/N 166 /COST/ 2007 and COST Action D 38.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} {{is a relatively}} young medical field. The nuclear medicine department performs both diagnostic tests and therapies using open radiation sources whereas the diagnostic use currently prevails. The imaging method used is called scintigraphy and uses a scintillation camera capturing the distribution of administered radiopharmaceutical. Using a scintillation detector, which is incorporated in a gamma camera, {{the distribution of the}} radiopharmaceutical in the target tissue can be observed, either after {{a certain period of time}} from the administration of the radiopharmaceutical (static scintigraphy) or over time (dynamic scintigraphy). One of the most common examinations performed at the nuclear medicine department is bone scintigraphy. The examination is carried out using osteotropic radiopharmaceutical that binds to bones, thus revealing pathologies caused by the change of metabolic activity. The examination in itself takes place through external detection of the administered radiopharmaceutical. Bone scintigraphy is a very useful examination that is used to detect bone metastases in cancer diseases, to diagnose primary malignant bone tumors, to detect infectious processes in the bones, to diagnose joint diseases, metabolic diseases of the skeleton, and bone injuries. The examination in itself is performed by using radiopharmaceuticals. Once administered, the radiopharmaceutical serves as a diagnostic indicator. This is a medicine that incorporates a radionuclide that emits ionizing radiation. The radionuclides used in nuclear medicine are artificially prepared and transported either as ready-to-use products or as radionuclide generators to the nuclear medicine department. The generator that is the most commonly used at the nuclear medicine department is the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. The above mentioned radionuclide generator consists of a glass chromatography column which is located in a lead shielding cylinder. The column contains the adsorbent material (alumina) in which the parent radionuclide is adsorbed. Due to different chemical properties of the parent and the daughter element the <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide</b> can be washed out (eluted) by means of a suitable solution. In practice, the radiopharmaceuticals are commonly prepared using kits that are commercially available. The kits are labeled by using sodium pertechnetate solution obtained from the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. Prior to the administration of the radiopharmaceutical to the patient it is necessary to carry out the determination of radiochemical purity. The most commonly used is a paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography. In the Czech Republic, 99 mTc labelled diphosphonates (e. g. the kits TechneScan HDP, 6 -MDP or 8 -MDP are used for bone scintigraphy. These osteotropic radiopharmaceuticals are prepared in a shielded laminar box in the radiopharmaceutical laboratory at the nuclear medicine department. The preparation is subject to the manufacturer's instructions. After preparation, prior to administration to the patient, the determination of radiochemical purity needs to be performed. The determination of radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical TechneScan HDP is carried out by using thin layer chromatography (ITLC-SG) by means of 13. 6 % solution of sodium acetate and methyl ethyl ketone as eluent. However, this determination is demanding for the normal operation of the department in terms of design as well as costs. Therefore, a suitable alternative method was sought. The new method consists in paper chromatography by using 0. 9 % solution of sodium chloride and acetone as eluent. After 50 determinations of radiochemical purity using pharmacopoeial and alternative methods was found that the alternative method is applicable for the routine determination of radiochemical purity during normal operation of the nuclear medicine departmen...|$|E

In addition, the Remote Sensing Program has acquired the results of earlier surveys at Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) (1990) and PORTS (1990). These radiological surveys provide data for characterization and long-term monitoring of U. S.

Sensors measure the ground-level gamma energy spectrum in the 38 to 3, 026 KeV range. Analysis can provide gamma emission strength in counts per second for either gross or total man-made gamma emissions. Gross count gamma radiation includes natural background radiation from terrestrial sources (radionuclides present in small amounts in the earth`s soil and bedrock), from radon gas, and from cosmic rays from outer space as well as radiation from man-made radionuclides. Man-made count gamma data include only the portion of the gross count that can be directly attributed to gamma rays from man-made radionuclides. Interpretation of the gamma energy spectra can make possible the determination of which specific radioisotopes contribute to the observed man-made gamma radiation, either as direct or as indirect (i. e., daughter) gamma energy from specific radionuclides (e. g., cesium- 137, cobalt- 60, uranium- 238) ...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{radioactive}} xenon {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere over a two year period has been performed {{as part of a}} research program to develop real-time measurement capabilities. The initial measurements were made to develop, prove, and validate the authors technical approach, while the longer-term measurements are being undertaken to establish natural background concentrations and variability with time. The results reported were made using noble gas fraction (typically 90 % Kr and 10 % Xe by weight) gas samples obtained from a commercial air-reduction plant in the northeastern US over a two-year interval beginning in the fall of 1993. The concentrated gas samples were typically obtained during a 6 [...] 8 hour interval at the commercial reduction plant and were shipped overnight to their laboratory. Analysis was typically completed approximately 24 hours after sampling. The analytical separation process typically took approximately 6 hours and gamma-ray spectrometric measurements were conducted for intervals ranging from 3 to 16 hours. The technical approach involved removal of potentially interfering radon <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> using a molecular sieve at room temperature, followed by cryogenic concentration of noble gases using a chilled ({minus} 76 C) activated carbon molecular sieve. During initial measurements both molecular sieve materials were contained in 30 foot x 1 / 4 inch gas chromatography columns for analytical separations. Krypton was separated from Xenon during the analytical procedure by warming the activated carbon molecular sieve to room temperature after initial noble gas concentration and actively pumping it away. Xenon- 133 adsorbed to the activated charcoal molecular sieve was then quantified via its 81 keV gamma-ray using initially a p-type intrinsic germanium detector and later a higher efficiency (64 % relative to a 3 inch x 3 inch sodium iodide) n-type intrinsic germanium detector...|$|R
3000|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} decay scheme of 230 U {{which may be}} used as a {{generator}} of 226 Th. The half-life of 226 Th of only 31 minutes entails all problems and application restrictions that have already been mentioned for 213 Bi. The direct use of 230 U with a half-life of 20.8 days requires a carrier that safely retains 226 Th and also 222 Ra due to their half-lifes of 31 m and 38 s, respectively. The half-life of 222 Ra is already very short, but assuming release in a post-capillary venule where the velocity of blood has its lowest values of 0.1 mm/s (Intaglietta et al., 1975), free 222 Ra could move more than 3 mm away from the position of planned treatment and subsequently emitted α-particles would irradiate tissue outside the targeted volume. The same considerations applied to 218 Rn (T 1 / 2 = 38 ms [...]) and 214 Po (T 1 / 2 = 164 μs) show that the α-particles emitted by these radionuclides would still have a reasonable chance to reach the target volume. The decay product of 214 Po is 210 Pb, which directly emits an α-particle or undergoes a β-decay leading to the emission of a further α-particle. However, due to the very long half-life of 22.3 years the treatment is practically finished with the formation of 210 Pb as the dose rate drops drastically. Even though the highly toxic 210 Po (T 1 / 2 = 138.4 d) appears in the decay scheme, it will be formed in very small amounts and will decay in radioactive equilibrium with its very long-lived mother radioisotope with an effective half-life of also 22.3 years. Whether this can be tolerated has to be assessed on the basis of detailed and careful risk-benefit analysis taking into account the totally applied activity of 230 U in the treatment, the disease to be treated and the age of the patient. If so, the use of 230 U offers the possibility to profit from 5 α-particles for therapy, due to the very short half-lifes of 218 Rn and 214 Po and the very long one of the [...] "quasi stable" [...] 210 Pb, while only the first two recoiling <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in the decay chain must be retained by the carrier entity.|$|R
40|$|Alpha {{particle}} emitting isotopes are {{in considerable}} interest for radionuclide therapy {{because of their}} high cytotoxicity and short path length. Unfortunately, all available emitters have serious disadvantages: 211 At forms weak bond with carbon atoms in the biomolecule {{and in the case}} of 212 Bi and 213 Bi short half-life often limits the application of these nuclides. However, the short half-life of 212 Bi and 213 Bi could be effectively lengthened by binding the parent radionuclide 212 Pb (t 1 / 2 = 10. 6 h) or 225 Ac (t 1 / 2 = 10 d) to the biomolecule, thereby effectively extending the use of short half-life 212 Bi and 213 Bi. In addition, in vivo generator delivers much greater dose per unit of administered activity compared to 212 Bi and 213 Bi alone. In our studies we investigated the use of TiO 2 nanoparticles as potential carriers for 225 Ac/ 213 Bi in vivo generator. The TiO 2 nanoparticles have unique properties like: high specific surface, high affinity for multivalent cations and simple way of synthesis, which are useful in the process of labelling. Commercially available (e. g. P- 25 Degussa) and synthesised in our laboratory nanoparticles were used in experiments. The nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, SEM, DLS and NanoSight techniques. In our experiments we tested two different methods of labelling. The first one was based on the possibility of formation strong bonds with certain cations on the surface of the nanopraticles. In the second one, TiO 2 nanoparticles were doped with 225 Ac during the process of synthesis. In both cases we obtained high yields of labelling (> 99 %). Afterwards, the stability of labelled nanoparticles was examined in 0. 9 % NaCl, 10 - 3 M EDTA, solutions of biologically active substances (cysteine, glutathione) and human serum. In the case of TiO 2 nanoparticles with 225 Ac, which was built in the crystalline structure, the leakage of 225 Ac and its <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> was not significant in any of solutions, even when the incubation time was extended to 10 days. The leakage in serum, from nanoparticles with adsorbed 225 Ac on their surface, was slightly higher, but still insignificant. The obtained results show high stability of labelled nanoparticles and allow to begin further experiments, which are based on modification of the surface by silane compounds which enable binding TiO 2 nanoparticles to the biomolecules.

40|$|The MILDOS Computer Code {{estimates}} impacts from radioactive {{emissions from}} uranium milling facilities. These impacts {{are presented as}} dose commitments to individuals and the regional population within an 80 km radius of the facility. Only airborne releases of radioactive materials are considered: releases to surface water and to groundwater are not addressed in MILDOS. This code is multi-purposed {{and can be used}} to evaluate population doses for NEPA assessments, maximum individual doses for predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations, or maximum offsite air concentrations for predictive evaluations of 10 CFR 20 compliance. Emissions of radioactive materials from fixed point source locations and from area sources are modeled using a sector-averaged Gaussian plume dispersion model, which utilizes user-provided wind frequency data. Mechanisms such as deposition of particulates, resuspension. radioactive decay and ingrowth of <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> are included in the transport model. Annual average air concentrations are computed, from which subsequent impacts to humans through various pathways are computed. Ground surface concentrations are estimated from deposition buildup and ingrowth of radioactive daughters. The surface concentrations are modified by radioactive decay, weathering and other environmental processes. The MILDOS Computer Code allows the user to vary the emission sources as a step function of time by adjustinq the emission rates. which includes shutting them off completely. Thus the results of a computer run can be made to reflect changing processes throughout the facility&#x 27;s operational lifetime. The pathways considered for individual dose commitments and for population impacts are: • Inhalation • External exposure from ground concentrations • External exposure from cloud immersion • Ingestioo of vegetables • Ingestion of meat • Ingestion of milk • Dose commitments are calculated using dose conversion factors, which are ultimately based on recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These factors are fixed internally in the code, and {{are not part of the}} input option. Dose commitments which are available from the code are as follows: • Individual dose commitments for use in predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations (Radon and short-lived daughters are excluded) • Total individual dose commitments (impacts from all available radionuclides are considered) • Annual population dose commitments (regional, extraregional, total and cummulative).

40|$|This review {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the successes and challenges currently faced in alpha radionuclide therapy. Alpha particles have an advantage in killing tumour cells as compared to beta or gamma radiation due to their short penetration depth and high linear energy transfer (LET). Touching briefly on the clinical successes of radionuclides emitting only one alpha particle, the main focus of this article lies on those alpha-emitting radionuclides with multiple alpha-emitting daughters in their decay chain. While having the advantage of longer half-lives, the recoiled <b>daughters</b> of <b>radionuclides</b> like 224 Ra (radium), 223 Ra, and 225 Ac (actinium) can do significant damage to healthy tissue when not retained at the tumour site. Three different approaches to deal with this problem are discussed: encapsulation in a nano-carrier, fast uptake of the alpha emitting radionuclides in tumour cells, and local administration. Each approach has been shown to have its advantages and disadvantages, but when larger activities need to be used clinically, nano-carriers appear to be the most promising solution for reducing toxic effects, provided there is no accumulation in healthy tissue.

40|$|Isotopic {{reference}} materials certified for {{the age of}} nuclear material (uranium, plutonium) are needed {{in the fields of}} nuclear forensics and environmental measurements. Therefore a feasibility study for the development of plutonium {{reference materials}} for age dating has been started recently at the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (EC-JRC-IRMM). The "age" of the material is defined as the time that has passed since the last chemical separation of the mother and daughter isotopes (e. g. 241 Pu and 241 Am). Assuming that the separation has been complete and all the daughter isotopes have been removed from the original material during this last separation, the age of the material can be determined by measuring the ratio of daughter and mother radio-nuclides, e. g. 241 Am/ 241 Pu. At a given time after the last separation and depending on the half lives of the radio-nuclides involved, a certain amount of the <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclide(s)</b> will be present. For the determination of the unknown age of a material different "clocks" can be used; "clocks" are pairs of mother and daughter radio-nuclides, such as 241 Am/ 241 Pu, 238 Pu/ 234 U, 239 Pu/ 235 U, 240 Pu/ 236 U, and possibly 242 Pu/ 238 U. For the age estimation of a real sample, such as material seized in nuclear forensics investigations or dust samples in environmental measurements, it is advisable to use more than one clock in order to ensure the reliability of the results and to exclude the possibility that the sample under question is a mixture of two or more materials. Consequently, a future reference material certified for separation date should ideally be certified for more than one "clock" or several reference materials for different "clocks" should be developed. The first step {{of this study is to}} verify the known separation dates of different plutonium materials of different ages and isotopic compositions by measuring the mother (238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Pu, 242 Pu) and daughter (234 U, 235 U, 236 U, 238 U and 241 Am) isotope abundances and to estimate the achievable uncertainties of the calculated ages. Thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) is applied for the measurement of the plutonium and uranium isotope ratios after chemical separation of the plutonium and uranium fractions from the sample matrix, while 241 Am is measured by gamma-ray spectrometry.

40|$|Pre-print versionLandscape, Heritage and Paleoenvironment Laboratory, University of Santiago, Spain Geophysical {{prospection}} {{methods are}} used in archaeology to locate features of archaeological sites before excavation. Among geophysical methods, those mostly used in archaeology are seismic methods, electromagnetical surveys, and georadar. All of them allow assessing properties of soil, sediment and/or rock, providing cross section of soil properties that {{can be related to}} buried archaeological structures and objects. Gamma-ray spectrometry (GRS) is a technique used for different geological purposes including mineral exploration and mapping. However, it has not been applied in archaeology: the only study case known by the authors was successful (Moussa, 2001) but no later reports or more extensive studies have been found. In situ GRS is a non-destructive method that allows direct assessment of potassium- 40 (40 K), uranium- 238 (238 U) and thorium- 232 (232 Th) and <b>daughter</b> <b>radionuclides</b> of their decay chains on rock outcrops and soils. Such radionuclides are ubiquitous in most rocks and soils and the main causes of natural gamma radiation. The technique allows assessing their concentration in topsoil, being of potential use for archaeological exploration but two assumptions must be made: the archaeological buried objects must contain a different concentration of radionuclides than the surrounding sediment or soil, and they must be buried in the topsoil (25 - 30 cm depth). Thus, it is potentially applicable for exploration of shallow structures or objects. However, it does not provide cross -sections of the ground, but maps of the structures and objects buried. In this work, we have tested in situ GRS in an archaeological site that was partially excavated. In the site, remains of walls made of stone have been excavated, being buried {{in other parts of the}} site, but near the ground surface, being the top of the structures at 10 - 30 cm depth. We have tested in situ GRS in small parcel of 10 x 7 m, located beside nearby excavated areas which wall remains are partially buried in the studied parcel. The purpose of the study is to assess if the technique is reliable for the exploration of structures. Rocks used as building materials in the walls are mostly metamorphic rocks of very low radionuclide content with negligible 40 K. However, the sediment that uries the structures contains significant amounts of K, U and Th radioisotopes. Results showed reliable results for surface exploration where shallow structures exist, despite the low radioactive content of the archaeological materials in the site.
