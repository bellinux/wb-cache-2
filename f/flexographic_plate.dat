As 3 D printing technologies are frequently used to manufacture interchangeable parts and for applications such as rapid prototyping, it is little surprise that {{a growing body of research}} has examined the accuracy of these devices (e. g. Ostrout, 2015). It is customary for these studies to utilize digital microscopes together with appropriate imaging software to analyze and quantify the unique nature of 3 D printed samples. It is recognized that such microscopes are generally rather costly, and are not especially intuitive to use. An alternative to digital microscopes would therefore be welcome, such a solution would need to be capable of measuring not only length and width (x and y directions), but also in height (z direction). One measurement technology that could be utilized for measurement of 3 D printed products is the <b>Flexographic</b> <b>plate</b> meter. Although these meters are designed to measure flexographic relief plates, there is a possibility that they could be utilized to measure 3 D printed products, as well. The present study examines and compares digital microscope technology with a commercial available <b>flexographic</b> <b>plate</b> meter. Specifically, a Keyence VHX- 2000 E digital microscope (VHX) is compared to a BetaFlex Pro plate meter in 3 D printing applications by reading the same 3 D printed samples and examining the subsequent data using descriptive statistics and a Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (R 2 ̆ 6 R) study...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} three years, a number of {{photopolymer}} plates for flexographic printing have appeared on the market. The use of such a plate greatly simplifies flexographic platemaking by reducing the process to a level {{similar to that of}} a presensitized plate for offset lithography. A series of experiments were conducted {{to determine whether or not}} there were significant differences in the areas of half tone dots in different areas of the tonal scale on different types of <b>flexographic</b> <b>plate</b> materials all made from a single negative with a specially designed test object on it. Assuming significant differences were found in the dot areas among the various plates, we further wished to discover whether or not these differences would have a significant effect on the tones printed from these plates or whether differences would be overshadowed by the multitude of other press variables. Differences in the areas of halftone dots among the different types of printing plates were confirmed at the 95 % level of statistical significance. Further, these differences were detectable in printed reproductions made from these plates, although other variables of flexographic printing had a much greater confirmed influence on tone reproduction...|$|E

40|$|The mass {{production}} of organic photovoltaics requires high throughput processes {{capable of producing}} a functional active layer which is homogenous, pinhole free and of a specified thickness. Common methods to achieve this are slot-die coating and gravure printing.

This was achieved by optimizing the <b>flexographic</b> <b>plate</b> pattern, print speed, the solvent and the drying process. By incorporating halftone patterning, a common process in the graphics printing industry, and optimizing the printing speed, the homogeneity of the active layer print was significantly improved.

40|$|The flexographic {{printing}} {{process has been}} used for package printing applications since the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Recent improvements in the flexographic technology have enabled flexographic printers to compete in new market areas that have historically been served by roto-gravure or offset lithographic printing. Occurring simultaneously with the {{flexographic printing}} improvements has been the infusion of personal computer-based graphic design capabilities. Designers can optimize quality only when they understand {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the printing process that will be used to mass produce their design. Desktop design capabilities and the need for flexographic print quality to match or exceed lithographic and roto-gravure print quality are both factors that accentuate the need to understand the process in an effort to create a design that will be of high quality when printed flexographically. Designing package graphics for the flexographic process is unique for a number of reasons, (the 2 ̆ 2 master image carrier 2 ̆ 2 (printing plate) is significantly different from roto-gravure and offset lithography, the inks used in flexography are significantly different form those used in gravure) and a wider assortment of substrates may be printed by the flexographic process than by the offset lithographic process. Each substrate has its own printing characteristics. This thesis will inform those who may be interested in designing for flexographic printing of the unique considerations that should be addressed when designing a package graphic for flexographic printing. Considerations specifically addressed are; variable repeat length capabilities, reverse-side printing, trapping, typography halftones and dot-gain screen ruling and substrate, step-and-repeat and <b>flexographic</b> <b>plate</b> elongation...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic {{development}} {{which has}} sparked flexography {{is the introduction}} and use of photopolymer plates. These <b>plates</b> have simplified <b>flexographic</b> printing by {{reducing the amount of}} time and effort needed to prepare plates for press and makeready. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of commonly used solvent mixtures on <b>flexographic</b> <b>plates.</b> The plates tested include those using natural rubber, Buna N, and various photopolymers. The experiment specifically studied change in hardness of these plate materials due to immersion in different solvent mixtures over time. Noticeable differances in the degree of softening of plates was observed after 24 hours of immersion. Differences in the degree of softening were found in the plates after soaking in different percents of solvents. It was also discovered what percents of different lactol spirits and normal propyl acetate added to alcohol would affect the plates the most. Further, these differences were detectable at different periods of time. Most plates softened with time. One plate softened to such a degree with the solvent of this experiment that it was difficult to determine which solvents had a significant effect. This, of course, {{is due to the fact}} that solvents compatible with this plate were not used in this experiment. All photopolymer plates performed poorly in acetates, but it would be possible to use acetates with these plates over short periods of time on small press runs. When using <b>flexographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the composition tested in this experiment it is recommended that the practitioner use less than five percent of lactol or ten percent normal propyl acetate for a minimum affect on these plates over a short period of time...|$|R

To make a complete picture, regardless of printing on flexible film or corrugated paper, the image transferred from each plate has to register exactly with the images transferred from the other colors. To ensure an accurate picture is made, mounting marks are made on the <b>flexographic</b> <b>plates.</b> These mounting marks can be microdots (down to 0.3 mm) and/or crosses. Special machinery is made for mounting these plates on the printing cylinders to maintain registration. Earle L.

PrintingA flexographic {{print is}} made by {{creating}} a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. <b>Flexographic</b> <b>plates</b> can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Deformation of the <b>flexographic</b> {{printing}} <b>plate</b> is {{an important}} factor in determining the quality of the printed image. A numerical model of the individual dots has been developed and used to examine the deformation of the plate under a range of printing conditions and image characteristics. Two mechanisms have been identified for the deformation of the image on the plate: expansion of the dot surface and dot barrelling. These results have been combined with those from an experimental study to apportion the dot gain due to ink spreading and physical deformation of the dot. The results have shown the low-coverage dots at high line rulings to be particularly affected by the effect of variation in the impression pressure. This has significant implications for the ability of the process to reproduce high-resolution images that combine both highlight and shadow regions successfully and consistently. Ink spreading has been identified as the major cause of dot gain, except at low coverages, where the deformation of the dots makes a significant contribution...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{swelling}} properties of photopolymer <b>flexographic</b> printing <b>plates</b> {{related to the}} variations of UVC post-treatment have been analysed. The {{aim of the research}} was to interconnect the changes in the crosslinking degree of the photopolymer material occurring due to the modified UVC radiation of the printing plate and the changes of its surface free energy crucial in the graphic reproduction process. Changes in the crosslinking degree in the photopolymer materials have been analysed by {{the swelling}} experiments. Results have proven that the partial dissolution of the photopolymer material caused by the immersion of the printing plates in various solvents is in the direct relation with the changes of the dispersive surface free energy. UVC post-treatment, used for the crosslinking termination and the definition of the surface properties of printing plates, is therefore directly affecting the resistivity of the printing plate in the solvent environment. By calculating the correlation coefficients for the weight loss of the photopolymer material in solvents and the dispersive surface free energy, the relation between the crosslinking degree and the UVC post-treatment has been established...|$|R
50|$|In printing, anilox is {{a method}} used to provide a {{measured}} amount of ink to a flexo printing plate An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells. ==Usage== Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. Low line screen rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in four-color process work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job.Depending {{on the design of}} the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roll. A doctor blade is used to scrape excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to contact with the <b>flexographic</b> printing <b>plate</b> which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material.|$|R

In {{addition to the}} identified factors, {{it was hypothesized that}} the level of exposure could influence the plate shoulder angle. It was further hypothesized that an optimization of shoulder angle with respect to halftone dot area may reduce the dot gain of the printing process. An experiment was conducted using a novel method of plate exposure. Continuous-tone masks were placed in contact with the plate back and the halftone negative used on the plate face. The resulting shoulder angles were measured and analyzed for significant fit to a linear mathematical model. For many dot sizes the face exposure level was significant in determining shoulder angle. The plates were printed on a flexographic press, and prints were analyzed to identify any benefits in dot gain reduction. Regression analysis showed very inconsistent correlations between shoulder angle and dot gain for individual dot sizes printed at an optimized level of impression...|$|R
