50|$|Organized {{into six}} “stages” of {{increasing}} sensitivity to difference, the DMIS identifies the underlying cognitive orientations individuals use to understand cultural difference. Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of cultural difference, {{which in turn}} allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures. By identifying the underlying experience of cultural difference, predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum. The first three stages are ethnocentric as one sees his own culture as central to reality. Climbing the scale, one develops a more and more <b>ethnorelative</b> point of view, meaning that one experiences one's own culture as {{in the context of}} other cultures.By the fourth stage, ethnocentric views are replaced by <b>ethnorelative</b> views.|$|E

The study shows that intercultural experiences transform a childcare teacher's world view from being ethnocentric to <b>ethnorelative.</b> Moreover, intercultural experiences have great impact on their pedagogical concepts: reevaluating their own pedagogical concept including stereotypes, becoming more accepting of differences and diversity, and more tolerant. This transformation would be an essential quality for childcare teachers who are involved in multicultural childcare and education...|$|E

40|$|Being a {{study abroad}} student {{is not all}} {{sweetness}} and light. By definition, study abroad students are faced with acculturative stress (Berry, 2005) by virtue of encountering differences in assumptions, values, and expectations of daily living in their host culture.

We integrate research on experiential learning and cultural intelligence to propose a process model that focuses on how leaders translate their international work assignment experiences into learning outcomes critical for global leadership development. Our model positions cultural intelligence as a moderator that enhances the likelihood that individuals on international assignments will actively engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, reflect, conceptualize, experiment), which in turn leads to global leadership self-efficacy, <b>ethnorelative</b> attitudes toward other cultures, accurate mental models of leadership across cultures, and flexibility of leadership styles.

40|$|Our {{multicultural}} world increasingly {{demands that}} we learn foreign languages {{to be able to}} interact effectively and appropriately with members of other cultures. This is of particular importance in fields such as government, education, and commerce. Effective intercultural interaction entails developed intercultural sensitivity, knowledge of cultural aspects as well as the ability to communicate in the language. This is known as Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC). The study of effective intercultural communication should be taught alongside the linguistic aspect of language. Yet, the teaching of culture in foreign language classes is often superficial. There is no consensus with regard to how develop and assess intercultural sensitivity and ICC and in the foreign language classroom. This study hypothesizes that an intercultural approach to teaching foreign languages facilitates the development of the learners’ intercultural communicative skills and linguistic proficiency while raising cultural awareness, developing contextualized cultural knowledge, and fostering intercultural attitudes of respect and understanding for one’s own culture and the cultures of others. The study analyzes and assesses the development of intercultural sensitivity and ICC in a university advanced conversation and composition Spanish course called here the Intercultural Spanish Course. The curriculum for this course was designed specifically for this study and integrates linguistic and intercultural communication skills and knowledge. A mixed methods design was used: A) Quantitative instruments: 1. Hammer & Bennett’s (2001) Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) B) Qualitative instruments: 1. Pre/ post learners’ questionnaires 2. Pre/ post learners’ journals Bennett‘ s (1993) Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) was used to analyze the IDI pre/ post results. For the qualitative data analysis themes were categorized following Byram’s (1997) Model of Intercultural Communicative Competence (MICC). The results of the study show that 50 % of the learners developed their intercultural sensitivity toward an <b>ethnorelative</b> orientation whereas 50 % moved toward an ethnocentric orientation. Learners developed their ICC as they (1) gained deeper cultural knowledge of Spanish- speaking countries; (2) developed critical thinking skills and skills to interpret cultural differences in a more <b>ethnorelative</b> perspective; (3) showed intercultural attitudes of understanding other perspectives, interest in engaging in conversation with Spanish speakers and willingness to question their worldviews; (4) raised self- cultural- awareness; and (5) improved their language proficiency...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, school {{teachers}} {{are expected to}} be able to teach about and across cultures, as well as teach in digitally enriched classrooms. Teacher educators are expected to prepare their teaching students for such challenges. One university designed the eTutor online environment to enhance and support the development of pre-service teachers&# 039; (PSTs) intercultural capability, as well as enhance their capability to use digital technologies in their own teaching practices. Over 450 PSTs and school students from eight schools across four countries interacted with each other online for a 14 -week period.

30|$|The {{alternative}} to this default method of ethical judgment is contextual relativism. That developmental position demands {{that we take}} the perspective of others; it calls for empathically participating in others’ reality, including taking their ethical position on the conflictual issue. In paradigmatic terms, contextual relativism is based in constructivism, in that it assumes that alternative viable realities exist {{and that we can}} empathically have access to them. Then, only after having experienced our opponents’ world, can we formulate an <b>ethnorelative</b> action—Commitment in relativism. Such an action may look the same as one taken from an ethnocentric position, but it is not; it is respectful of the full humanity of others, including their differing viable values. The world could be the other way, but we can choose that it should not be. So, even if we were to decide to violently stop another person or group from doing something, assuming that we had empathically engaged them first, we would be doing so from a considered choice rather than an immutable conviction. This exercise of ethical consciousness is enabled by a constructivist epistemology and necessary for maintaining a climate of respect for diversity.|$|E

The sample consisted of 50 study abroad participants and 50 students on home campus. The instrument Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) was employed to assess the intercultural sensitivity level of Mainland Chinese students before and after study abroad experience. The paired samples t-test results reveal that study abroad students did not make statistically significant gains in the overall intercultural sensitivity through participation in the year-long study abroad program. Although there were statistically significant differences in the posttest <b>ethnorelative</b> scales between study abroad students and students on the home campus, the study abroad students did not make significantly greater progress in their overall intercultural sensitivity between the pretest and posttest than the comparison group. The regression results indicated that the independent variable of total amount of previous intercultural experience significantly contributed to the development of intercultural sensitivity. On average, study abroad students participants were in the stage of Minimization as measured by IDI prior to study abroad and remained at the same stage by the conclusion of the study abroad experience. The findings imply that the study abroad program needs to provide support to increase students’ skills and sensitivity so that they can deal effectively with cultural differences...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{intercultural skills}} is {{recognized}} as an essential outcome of a college education, {{but in order to}} facilitate students' growth effectively, we must understand the points of the developmental journey at which students enter the college classroom. This study tests four hypotheses developed on the basis of leading models of intercultural development in relation to first-year students' levels of maturity, attitudes toward difference, capacity for productive interaction and emotions experienced in the face of difference. To test the hypotheses, we collected written narratives on a formative encounter with difference from 414 incoming students at the University of Minnesota. Each narrative was coded for an initial, intermediate or advanced stage of intercultural development, {{as well as for the}} outcomes of the interaction and emotions experienced in the course of the encounter. Findings indicate that: (1) only 21 % of respondents display evidence of <b>ethnorelative</b> thinking; (2) the majority report very positive attitudes toward difference, but show evidence of veiled detachment and minimization; (3) there is no difference in reports of productive interaction between those who do and do not display mindfulness and (4) the emotions experienced at various stages of intercultural maturity do not yield a pattern of increasing comfort. We conclude that the points at which our students begin their intercultural journey may differ slightly from what is suggested by leading developmental models, and recommend adjusting the starting point of programming aimed at supporting intercultural competence development in college...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper {{is to examine the}} risks and {{challenges}} related to the cooperation of pedagogical assistants (PAs) with Roma parents/ families and their work with Roma pupils, as well as to offer further insight into ways to overcome these risks and challenges. Roma pupils and parents/ families face numerous difficulties in education, which are reflected in prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. The education policy measure of introducing PAs, formerly known as Roma teaching assistants, to the Serbian education system aimed to contribute to the learning and social participation of Roma pupils and to establish cooperation between school staff and Roma parents. The further segregation of Roma pupils and the reduced engagement of teachers in supporting Roma pupils and fostering communication with Roma parents are seen as possible risks related to the engagement of PAs. In order to minimise the risks, we propose a framework for defining and understanding the roles of teachers and PAs from an intercultural perspective. Relying on two concepts – intercultural sensitivity (IS) and intercultural competence (IC) – we elaborate the necessity of perceiving cultural differences in accordance with an <b>ethnorelative</b> world view, {{on the part of both}} teachers and PAs. In addition, we outline the cognitive, affective and behavioural aspects of IC that we believe teachers and PAs should possess. Further recommendations regarding the engagement of PAs and the minimisation of risks and challenges are proposed...|$|E

Employing a qualitative case-study design, the study was conducted over the course of an academic year utilizing four participant observation periods and a series of five, in-depth, informal interviews. Bennett 2 ̆ 7 s Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity provides the theoretical framework for the analysis of the participant 2 ̆ 7 s intercultural development. This research details how the pre-service teacher 2 ̆ 7 s internship and immersion in a foreign school cultural context provided her with an appropriate intercultural challenge; in her experience as the cultural outsider, cultural difference could not be ignored. Her intercultural development was supported during the semester by her seminar leader who acted as a cultural translator, interpreting her experiences through a cultural lens and scaffolding interculturally sensitive ways of understanding her encounters. Findings demonstrate that the participant began the study with a limited cultural consciousness and superficial approach to cultural difference; however by the end of the study she was seeking out, accepting, and recognizing the influence of cultural differences within an educational context, and developing an <b>ethnorelative</b> worldview. Implications reveal the potential of teacher education study abroad programs to positively influence pre-service teachers 2 ̆ 7 intercultural development. Careful attention must be paid to the level of intercultural challenge faced by students within a study abroad program as well as the role of a translator and guide in supporting intercultural development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to (1) analyze the level of intercultural {{sensitivity}} of United Nations Volunteer (UNV) volunteers in terms of interpersonal communication in a multicultural working environment; (2) explore how UNV volunteers interact and communicate in a multicultural environment at community level by developing a cognitive structure to understand differences in culture and; (3) identify the level of intercultural sensitivity of the UNV volunteers. This study is intended to make a contribution to the research on Communication for Development from the perspective of Intercultural Communication, particularly by using the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) as a framework to analyze the Intercultural experiences of a number of UNV volunteers. The qualitative survey was conducted with selected UNV volunteers including national, international and former UNV volunteers from February 15, 2008 for 4 weeks. A total of 48 UNV volunteers from 26 countries, serving in 24 countries, participated in the survey. The methodology of content analysis was applied to analyze their intercultural sensitivity and communication skills. The results show that UNV volunteers experience a wide range of intercultural situations, including: language and relativity of experience, non-verbal behaviour, communication styles, monochronic and polychronic time, values and assumptions. Whereas some UNV volunteers seem to be at the ethnocentric stage, the majority of respondents are at the <b>ethnorelative</b> stages, which include the acceptance and adaptation stages of DMIS. In order to improve cultural sensitivity, intercultural trainings are provided to selected UNV volunteers at headquarters in Bonn. This study points to the need for the UNV programme to design and implement structured training in intercultural sensitivity for all UNV volunteers. These trainings should not be given only at Headquarters, but in every Country Office or Support Unit as part of a mainstreamed procedure for both national and international UNV volunteers. Building the capacity of intercultural communication and intercultural sensitivity of UNV volunteers will lead to optimal outcomes in their work through improved communication with colleagues, counterparts and local partners. Intercultural sensitivity is a critical aspect of communication for development. Intercultural sensitivity creates the two-way communication systems that allow communities to speak out, and by finding their voice, communities begin to realize ownership of the development agenda enshrined in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} aimed to: (1) reveal how intercultural {{language}} learning occurred within a sister school partnership at SMA Negeri 3 Yogyakarta, and (2) describe student behaviours which {{were perceived to}} be indicative of intercultural language learning. Using an ethnographic approach through observations and dialogues, this case study investigated intercultural language learning within the full complexity and uniqueness of the sister school partnership between SMA Negeri 3 Yogyakarta and its Australian school partner in a natural setting. This investigation involved a group of Indonesian students who were purposefully randomly selected as key participants together with their English teacher and some other teachers as the informants. It also involved a group of Australian students and their teachers as partners in intercultural interactions. This study incorporated qualitative data focusing on real life interactions occurring among the research participants which were collected {{for about six months}} through observations, in-depth interviews, document analyses, and student Focus Group Discussion (FGD). I myself was the main instrument of data collection, accompanied by the use of a video recorder, a voice recorder, a digital camera, observation sheets and FGD guidance. The data were then analysed qualitatively to provide a richly detailed description of the case. Four criteria for evaluating qualitative research including credibility, dependability, transferability, and catalytic authenticity were used to ensure the quality of the study. To enhance the trustworthiness of this study, triangulation was employed to clarity meaning and verifying the repeatability of all observations or interpretations. The results of this study showed that intercultural language learning occurred within the sister school partnership in the forms of learning experiences which engaged the students in interaction, observation and reflection with the target language and culture community. A number of indicators of intercultural language learning were revealed in the student behaviours within four areas including exploring language and culture in authentic situations, noticing verbal and non-verbal behaviours in the target language and culture interactions, making connections between home and the target language and culture, and reflecting on the development of a ‘third’ or intermediate personal position between cultures. These areas were perceived as authentic language experiences occurring within the partnership programs such as in school visits, cultural excursions and homestays which contributed to intercultural development towards a more <b>ethnorelative</b> world-view. This intercultural development was considered an ongoing process, and thus required continuous intercultural learning through new experiences and critical reflection...|$|E
40|$|Using interpretive {{qualitative}} research methods, this dissertation study examines how a telecollaboration {{in a social}} networking site affects learners’ intercultural competence development. In particular, it explores the changes in learners’ understanding {{of the concept of}} culture, as well as their understanding of their own and target cultures. Additionally, this study investigates what role the medium of the exchange plays in the project. Finally, it analyzes three individual learners’ experiences in an online intercultural exchange. Two intact classes of college-level language learners—U. S. students learning Spanish and Colombian students learning English—participated in an eight-week telecollaboration using Facebook. Each week students shared information about their own culture and reacted to the posts about the target culture made by the students in the partner class. This study analyzed 14 U. S. students’ experiences and learning, based on their pre- and post-telecollaboration questionnaires, reflexive portfolios, and pre- and post-telecollaboration one-on-one interviews. Data analysis demonstrated that the participants experienced a notable development in their intercultural competence. In particular, participants showed a more detailed understanding of the concept of culture, as well as the reasons for cultural learning and awareness. The activity of explaining their own culture to foreigners led the participants to an ongoing analysis of their own culture and, therefore, facilitated development in their understanding of the home culture. Specifically, participants were able to take a critical stance in their analysis and evaluate their own culture from the position of an outsider. Finally, participants gained knowledge about Colombian culture and developed an ability to analyze cultural products and practices, as well as infer information about cultural perspectives from that analysis. In general, the telecollaboration enabled participants to develop critical cultural awareness and change their worldviews from more ethnocentric to more <b>ethnorelative.</b> In regard to the use of Facebook, this popular social networking site proved to be uniquely suitable for a telecollaboration. It gave the participants an opportunity to create a personal learning environment that was accessible whenever and wherever they needed it. It also facilitated a bridging between participants’ learning and leisure online activities. The three case studies demonstrated that while any type of learner can benefit from telecollaboration, their experiences and the degree of intercultural competence development are individual. In addition, the development of intercultural competence appeared to be non-linear, which demonstrates the difficulty of its assessment. Based on the findings, the researcher concludes that telecollaboration facilitates the development of intercultural competence and, thus, is an effective way of addressing the challenge of culture instruction in foreign language courses. Additionally, the unique properties of social networking sites make them an easily accessible platform for telecollaboration projects...|$|E

This thesis investigates {{the potential of}} the digital simulation RealLives for the promotion of intercultural awareness and sensitivity in 12 - to 13 -year-old middle school students. It comprises three case studies conducted in International Baccalaureate Schools in Australia, Switzerland, and the USA, where teachers used RealLives with groups of seventh-grade students in different ways. Using an interpretivist approach, each case study consisted of observations, in-depth interviews with students and teachers, and questionnaire surveys to examine the use of RealLives by students and teachers in different school contexts and investigate {{the potential of the}} simulation for the development of intercultural awareness and sensitivity amongst young adolescents within classroom settings. As the findings of the three case studies show, RealLives was perceived largely positively by students and teachers in all three contexts. However, the teachers struggled to thoroughly integrate the simulation into their teaching, mainly due to limited time and resources, dense curricula, and technical difficulties. Although each teacher employed the medium in different ways, similar patterns and strategies of use and similar social dynamics emerged among students in all three case studies. Students used the simulation RealLives in potentially unique personally meaningful ways. Their use of and interaction with the simulation as well as its potential to promote intercultural awareness and sensitivity were determined by a range of intraindividual and interindividual factors, first and foremost by knowledge and experience, identity, and social learning. The findings provide evidence that using RealLives in school contexts can promote the development of intercultural awareness and sensitivity in a variety of ways. It can increase intercultural awareness in student players ? even in students who are already more interculturally competent or focus on game play rather than learning. Moreover, it can advance the development of intercultural sensitivity by creating/reinforcing curiosity in cultural issues, encouraging openness and flexibility through confrontation with new information and unfamiliar situations, and providing a wealth of opportunities for identification with characters and role playing, which can promote empathy and more <b>ethnorelative</b> worldviews. Overall, the study shows that using a digital game or simulation like RealLives can be a valuable educational strategy to promote intercultural awareness and sensitivity and one that adolescents would enjoy, particularly when it is thoroughly integrated into teaching, accompanied by complementary activities, such as discussions and debriefings, and guided by a knowledgeable teacher.

40|$|Intercultural {{competence}} {{has become}} an important goal of foreign language education {{in response to the}} need for learners to function effectively in an increasingly multicultural world. Language and culture are seen as interwoven and inseparable components and therefore learning a foreign language inevitably means learning about other ways of being and behaving. Many foreign language programmes around the world, particularly in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, have adopted an intercultural pedagogy which seeks to integrate into the language teaching experience opportunities for developing intercultural competence for language learners. This study investigates intercultural teaching and learning in tertiary EFL classrooms in Vietnam, a context in which intercultural approaches to language teaching and learning have not been widely considered. The study consisted of three phases. The first phase involved a curriculum review in which I critically evaluated the extent to which culture and culture learning are represented in the curriculum frameworks for tertiary EFL programmes and in the national education policy on foreign language education in Vietnam. The findings showed that the importance of culture and culture learning is not emphasised, and the designation of culture to separate culture courses establishes a separate status, construct and treatment of culture and culture learning in the EFL programmes. In {{the second phase of the}} study, I analysed the perceptions of fourteen Vietnamese EFL teachers and two hundred Vietnamese EFL students on culture in language teaching and learning, and their classroom practices. The findings indicated that the teachers' beliefs about culture teaching revealed a predictable priority for teaching language rather than culture. Their culture teaching practices were greatly influenced by their perceptions and beliefs regarding culture in language teaching. The students also treated culture as a subordinate priority in language learning. Overall, they found culture learning beneficial for their language learning and supported the teachability of language and culture in EFL classes. Both the teachers and students identified a number of constraints that restricted their opportunities and motivation to engage in teaching and learning culture. The third phase of the study involved an empirical study investigating the effect of adopting an intercultural stance in English speaking lessons on the development of the learners' intercultural competence. Over a nine-week teaching period, eighteen English speaking lessons (90 minutes / lesson / week) for two equivalent, intact classes (seventy-one students) were observed. For one class, the lessons were adapted to reflect the principles of intercultural language learning. For the other, no changes were made. The results showed that the intercultural competence of learners in the intercultural class increased by significantly more than that of learners in the standard class. In particular, the students in the intercultural class were able to better articulate <b>ethnorelative</b> awareness and attitudes towards their home culture and the target culture. The findings also showed that the reflective journal was an effective tool to assess learners' process of acquiring intercultural competence, particularly affective capacities that are not easy to evaluate by other means. Overall, the study provided evidence for the feasibility of intercultural teaching and learning in tertiary EFL classrooms in the Vietnamese context. It also showed that intercultural teaching and learning cultivated learners' affective capacities which are often overlooked in the EFL classroom. It is hoped that the study can inform the work of curriculum designers, education policy-makers as well as EFL teachers and students for the implementation of intercultural language teaching and learning in Vietnam and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Everywhere is home, if {{you know}} enough about how things work there” (Bennett, 2011, p. 5). This thesis {{critically}} assesses the relationships formed by East and South-East-Asian international students as they sojourn in New Zealand and attend university during that period. As the students gradually alter and develop their cultural perceptions toward a framework {{that enables them to}} learn, live and make sense of their intercultural relationships, they make friends among their East and South-East-Asian international student peers, domestic students, host-families, work-colleagues, flatmates and university and educational support-staff in Aotearoa/New Zealand. To critically assess these relationships, the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (Bennett and Hammer, 1998), or the DMIS, was used. There are six levels of the DMIS. These begin with the three ethnocentric stages of denial, defense and minimization where the individuals maintain the supports where possible from their own home-country cultures, rather than accessing the social supports offered in the immediate host-country context. The <b>ethnorelative</b> levels are acceptance, adaptation and integration and in these levels the individuals are able to access and draw from the cultural resources in their host-country cultural context. International students from AUT University, the University of Auckland and the University of Waikato comprised the sample of 50 participants, and they were interviewed in groups where possible and individually in some cases. The analysis of the interviews involved two types of analyses drawn from the interview data. Firstly, the students’ intercultural adaptation level was assessed from the interview transcripts, supplemented by field notes and sound files from which key moments of intercultural self and other-awareness were noted. The second analysis involved a close exploration of students’ reflections on their own intercultural adaptation and experiences. These were looked at across the five DMIS levels that were present in this sample. The relationships between the students and their various social networks of both fellow nationals, and other East and South-East-Asian international student peers and social groups in Aotearoa/New Zealand were examined because intercultural adaptation is premised upon intercultural communication confidence and the creation of relationships in the unfamiliar host-country. Overall, the findings showed that intercultural adaptation levels were internally regulated by the students, who were strong agents of their own intercultural adaptation levels. This suggests that intercultural adaptation is reliant upon the motivation of the individual rather than an external process created by host-country experiences. For some students, maintaining their study goals and returning to their home-countries to work was the main priority and their intercultural adaptation levels were typically lower. Those hoping to extend their sojourn had increased reliance upon intercultural relationships and established social groups in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This emphasis on agency showed that the students were more reliant upon maintaining the integrity and structures of their home-country culture than had been previously suggested within the frameworks of the DMIS. To better understand the agency of the students and the prevailing influence of their home-country culture, an alternative model for the sociological examination of the students is proposed in this thesis. This is the Adapted Model of Intercultural Skill-Sets for East and South-East Asian international students (AMISS). The AMISS was specifically developed for East and South-East-Asian international students as, in addition to intercultural communication, it incorporates the key experiences of negotiating from adolescence into young or emergent adulthood (Arnett, 2004) that is usually part of university experiences. The emphasis on a young sample undergoing emergent adulthood was combined with the Confucian family values (Hwang, 1999) of filial piety that are so important to the East and South-East-Asian region. Notions of guanxi that are prevalent among the Chinese diaspora throughout South-East Asia (Lew and Wong, 2004) were incorporated because the expectation of reciprocity and the duty of returned favours and services {{lies at the heart of}} many intercultural miscommunications between the student sojourners and their host-country. Although this project became methodological in focus and resulted in the development of a new model, this process was made possible by examining the relationships that ESEA students formed with their peer networks as well as their relationships and, in addition, provides some of the sojourners’ direct observations on the ethnic relationships between Pākehā and Māori groups in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|With rising {{demand for}} a {{workforce}} that can work cross-culturally (Mangan, 2011; Orahood, Woolf, & Kruze, 2008), {{it is not surprising}} that study abroad numbers continue to increase to a range of countries, destinations, and program types (Open Doors, 2012). However, while study abroad is often touted as the ideal means to incite linguistic and cultural competence, the reality of student learning is not a given (Alred & Byram, 2002; de Nooy & Hanna, 2003; Einbeck, 2002; Freed, 1995; Kearney, 2010; Kinginger, 2008; Kinginger, 2009; Rivers, 1998; Wilkinson, 2000). If higher education wishes to endorse study abroad as a means to acquire the crucial knowledge, skills, and attitudes of a globalized workforce (Miller, 2009), it is imperative that colleges and universities promote and integrate study abroad into the curriculum to foster the development of 21 st century global citizens. In order to examine what businesses actually valued in hiring, Trooboff, Vande Berg, and Rayman (2007) surveyed employers and found not only that they valued study abroad as a form of international education, but also that they specifically valued many intercultural skills. However, on average, the respondents did not believe that studying abroad led to the enhancement of these skills, echoing the dominant discourse of study abroad being a frivolous endeavor for wealthy white women (Gore, 2005). Trooboff et al. (2007) noted that students need to be better trained to translate their experiences for their potential employers. In a similar vein, Root and Ngampornchai (2012) recommended that students be trained in intercultural communication to better help them articulate their learning. Nevertheless, Deardorff (2008) noted that intercultural training should not be limited to pre-departure orientation, but that a series of workshops or even a course could help address intercultural learning needs. While a number of courses of this nature have been offered either before departure or upon return (eg. With rising {{demand for a}} workforce that can work cross-culturally (Mangan, 2011; Orahood, Woolf, & Kruze, 2008), {{it is not surprising that}} study abroad numbers continue to increase to a range of countries, destinations, and program types (Open Doors, 2012).

While a number of courses of this nature have been offered either before departure or upon return (eg. Brewer & Solberg, 2009; Downey, 2005), it appears that only one study to date examined the process of intercultural learning as it relates to study abroad (Anderson & Cunningham, 2009). The current study attempts to fill the gap in research by examining the effectiveness of a three-credit general education course in intercultural communication on the process of becoming interculturally competent. Additionally, it also examined the ability of post-study abroad students who enrolled in this course to articulate what they had learned while abroad in comparison with post-study abroad students who had not enrolled in the course. While most of the students (n = 33) participating in this study had enrolled in the course in intercultural communication were preparing to study abroad, there were also a number of participating students (n = 6) who had previously studied abroad. In this mixed-methods research, whose findings are reported in three separate, yet related, articles, answers to the following research questions were sought: 1. How does intercultural competence develop in post-study abroad students over the span of a semester-long course focused on the development of intercultural communication skills through critical reflection? The first article of this dissertation examines the process of unpacking the study abroad experience two students went through upon return to the home campus through the lens of experiential learning (Kolb, 1984), transformative learning (Mezirow, 2000), and ethnocentric versus <b>ethnorelative</b> worldviews (Bennett, 1993). The second article uses these same frameworks to investigate the learning process for four pre-study abroad students enrolled in this same course to answer the question: 2. Are there noticeable differences in the development of intercultural competence in pre-study abroad students who are enrolled in a semester-long course focused on the development of intercultural competence? Lastly, the third article examines how post-study abroad students articulated their learning abroad differently by answering the question: 3. Are post-study abroa...|$|E
