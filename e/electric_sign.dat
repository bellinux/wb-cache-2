5|$|This {{case had}} a lamp and socket used by Hammer {{for the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>sign</b> ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in {{sequence}} when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.|$|E

Young <b>Electric</b> <b>Sign</b> Company (YESCO) currently owns the sign, which leases it to Clark County, while the design itself is in the public domain. The design of the sign was never copyrighted since Willis considered this her gift {{to the city and}} wanted it to be in the public domain. This has resulted in the image being ubiquitous on Las Vegas souvenirs.|$|E
25|$|A section {{comprising}} one fiftieth of {{the total}} canopy equals {{the size of the}} world’s current largest <b>electric</b> <b>sign.</b> Originally, nearly 2.1 million incandescent lights were housed in the canopy. With the completion of the $17 million upgrade, more than 12 million LED lamps illuminate the overhead canopy. The new LED upgrade was designed and engineered by LG Electronics, who is also the primary corporate sponsor of the canopy. Within the canopy itself are 220 speakers powered by 550,000 watts of amplification.|$|E

25|$|The Neon Museum at the Fremont Street Experience {{opened in}} November 1996 with the Hacienda Horse & Rider sign being lit at the {{intersection}} of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street. The museum features signs from old casinos and other businesses displayed outdoors. For many years, the Young <b>Electric</b> <b>Sign</b> Company stored many of these signs in their bone yard. The signs were slowly being destroyed by exposure to the elements. The museum is slowly restoring the signs and placing them around the FSE.|$|E
25|$|Contractors begin soliciting {{ornaments}} for {{the trees}} along the Pathway of Peace about the same time, usually around a theme. Other vendors begin contacting nationally known singers, performers, and the providers of children's characters (such as Warner Bros. Animation, Sesame Workshop, or The Walt Disney Company) for their availability. Various contractors build the decorations, depending on what is required. In 2000, Brilliant <b>Electric</b> <b>Sign</b> Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, spent four weeks building the 200 ornaments required for that year's display. Many of the decorations in 2000 and 2002 were manufactured with the same high-tech plastic {{used to make the}} faceplates of astronaut helmets.|$|E
2500|$|Advertising also grew {{significantly}} in the 1920s, growing from $25 million to $85 million over the decade. For example, the Wrigley Spearmint Gum sign, possibly the biggest <b>electric</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "in the world," [...] cost $9,000 per month to rent. Some contemporary critics, such as Thorstein Veblen and G.K. Chesterton, disliked the advertising at Times Square. Fritz Lang, after seeing Times Square in 1923, used it as inspiration for his dark industrial film Metropolis.|$|E

Albee invested over $2 million in the vaudeville venue, which became known as the “…swankiest theater in the country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Kozlowski's {{concept was}} to use a {{combination}} of four colored light bulbs per [...] "light" [...] which allowed a full spectrum of colors. The Young <b>Electric</b> <b>Sign</b> Company assisted in creating the test panels and in the final installation. After the Fremont Street Experience opened, the light bulbs were checked nightly to ensure that all were functioning properly. To accomplish this massive undertaking, the length of the canopy was divided into panels. Each panel was checked by separately turning on each of the four colored light bulbs. A maintenance worker on a lift would then replace any bulbs that were out. The most expensive bulb cost nearly $15 to replace.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1934, Stein {{arrived in}} America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking {{from the ocean}} liner in New York, she {{encountered}} a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able {{get a sense of}} the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An <b>electric</b> <b>sign</b> in Times Square announced to all that [...] "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived". Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, at the {{suggestion}} of Mario Fermín Cabral, Congress voted overwhelmingly to change the name of the capital from Santo Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo. The province of San Cristobal was changed to [...] "Trujillo", and the nation's highest peak, Pico Duarte, was renamed Pico Trujillo. Statues of [...] "El Jefe" [...] were mass-produced and erected across the Republic, and bridges and public buildings were named in his honor. The nation's newspapers had praise for Trujillo as part of the front page, and license plates included slogans such as [...] "¡Viva Trujillo!" [...] and [...] "Año Del Benefactor De La Patria" [...] (Year of the Benefactor of the Nation.) An <b>electric</b> <b>sign</b> was erected in Ciudad Trujillo so that [...] "Dios y Trujillo" [...] could be seen at night {{as well as in the}} day. Eventually, even churches were required to post the slogan [...] "Dios en cielo, Trujillo en tierra" [...] (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth). As time went on, the order of the phrases was reversed (Trujillo on Earth, God in Heaven). Trujillo was recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize by his admirers, but the committee declined {{the suggestion}}.|$|E

6000|$|Miggleton's restaurant, on Forty-second Street, was {{a romantic}} discovery. Though it had [...] "popular prices"--plain omelet, fifteen cents--it had {{red and green}} bracket lights, mission-style tables, and music played by a sparrowlike pianist and a violinist. Mr. Wrenn never really heard the music, but while it was quavering he had a happier {{appreciation}} of the Silk-Hat-Harry humorous pictures in the Journal, which he always propped up against an oil-cruet. [That never caused him inconvenience; he had no convictions in regard to salads.] He would drop the paper to look {{out of the window}} at the Lazydays Improvement Company's <b>electric</b> <b>sign,</b> showing gardens of paradise on the instalment plan, and dream of--well, he hadn't the slightest idea what--something distant and deliciously likely to become intimate. Once or twice {{he knew that he was}} visioning the girl in soft brown whom he would [...] "go home to," [...] and who, in a Lazydays suburban residence, would play just such music for him and the friends who lived near by. She would be as clever as Istra, but [...] "oh, more so's you can go regular places with her."... Often he got good ideas about letters South, to be jotted down on envelope backs, from that music.|$|E
6000|$|The woman's {{sympathetic}} smile {{followed her}} {{as she left the}} shop. She had an instant of hesitation, of an almost panicky desire to go back and repair her folly, ere it was too late. Why had she taken her money with her that evening, if not with some deliberate though undefined purpose? But she was ashamed to face the saleswoman again, and her elation was not to be repressed--an elation optically presented by a huge <b>electric</b> <b>sign</b> on the farther side of the street that flashed through all the colours of the spectrum, surrounded by running fire like the running fire in her soul. Deliciously self-conscious, her gaze fixed ahead, she pressed through the Wednesday night crowds, young mill men and women in their best clothes, housewives and fathers of families with children and bundles. In front of the Banner office a group blocked the pavement staring up at the news bulletin, which she paused to read. [...] "Five Millionaire Directors Indicted in New York," [...] "State Treasurer Accused of Graft," [...] "Murdock Fortune Contested by Heirs." [...] The phrases seemed meaningless, and she hurried on again.... She was being noticed! A man looked at her, twice, the first glance accidental, the second arresting, appealing, subtly flattering, agitating--she was sure he had turned and was following her. She hastened her steps. It was wicked, what she was doing, but she gloried in it; and even the sight, in burning red letters, of Gruber's Cafe failed to bring on a revulsion by its association with her sister Lise. The fact that Lise had got drunk there meant nothing to her now. She gazed curiously at the illuminated, orange-coloured panes separated by curving leads, at the design of a harp in green, at the sign [...] "Ladies' Entrance"; listened eagerly to the sounds of voices and laughter that came from within. She looked cautiously over her shoulder, a shadow appeared, she heard a voice, low, insinuating....|$|E
