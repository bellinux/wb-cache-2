5|$|In 2009, McCoy {{was again}} in strong {{consideration}} for the Heisman, even with the two previous Heisman winners coming back for their senior seasons. At {{the start of the}} season he and Tebow were considered the favorites. But McCoy's numbers were <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from 2008, and despite leading his team to the BCS Championship game, his chances of winning disappeared during a close 13-12 Big 12 Title game in which he threw 3 interceptions, no touchdowns and nearly threw the game away at the end. Despite this, he still had an outstanding season and was again named a finalist, this time along with Tim Tebow, Mark Ingram, Jr, Toby Gerhart and Ndamukong Suh. He became only the 2nd Longhorn, along with Ricky Williams, to be a two-time Heisman finalist. He finished third behind Ingram and Gerhart.|$|E
25|$|His career slowed <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in the 1980s due {{to triple}} and quadruple heart bypass surgeries, but he {{continued}} cutting albums, including Wheels Of A Dream (1998), Old Man Jazz (2002) and The Nashville Connection (2004).|$|E
25|$|Fuchs {{lost control}} of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by {{renaming}} it the Boston Bees. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate Lou Perini, changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but the team rode the pitching of Warren Spahn to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage of}} a further two years saw {{the arrival of the}} one-one-one grid in 1981, albeit {{staggered}} in two rows. The turbocharged era had arrived for not only did Renault occupy the front row of the grid, but turbo-engined Ferraris were fourth and eighth. The Renaults dominated the race, but total reliability was still lacking and the day went to John Watson in a McLaren MP4/1. Second place went to Carlos Reutemann in the Williams FW07C from the Talbot-Ligier JS17 of Jacques Laffite, a lap down; the race speed was <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at 137.64mph.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 {{made its}} first hover on 11 June 1959, and made its famed {{successful}} crossing of the English Channel on 25 July 1959. In December 1959, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Saunders-Roe at East Cowes and persuaded the chief test-pilot, Commander Peter Lamb, {{to allow him to}} take over the SR.N1's controls. He flew the SR.N1 so fast that he was asked to slow <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> On examination of the craft afterwards, it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed, damage that was never allowed to be repaired, and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'Royal Dent'.|$|E
25|$|On {{arriving}} in Paris, Pelet insisted on seeing Emperor Napoleon as his orders from Masséna required, despite being discouraged to do so. After waiting patiently {{for an entire}} day, he was finally allowed to see Napoleon, who began by venting his anger at Pelet for the failed campaign in Portugal. After calming <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> the emperor offered {{up a series of}} pointed criticisms, which the undaunted Pelet carefully explained, defending both Masséna's and his own actions. By the end of the 3-hour interview, Napoleon's attitude changed to a friendlier one. Pelet was invited to return the next day and help Napoleon compose the bulletin that would be released to the public. Pelet recommended to the emperor that the corps commanders be removed. Evidently, this advice was followed because the corps commanders were soon sent home and the Army of Portugal was reorganized into six independent divisions. Napoleon then promoted Pelet to colonel. Another source gave the date of his promotion as 12 October 1812.|$|E

500|$|Homer Rodeheaver {{said that}} [...] "One of these sermons, until he {{tempered}} it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> had one ten-minute period in it where {{from two to}} twelve men fainted {{and had to be}} carried out every time I heard him preach it." [...] Some religious and social leaders criticized Sunday's exaggerated gestures as well as the slang and colloquialisms that filled his sermons, but audiences clearly enjoyed them.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said to me that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|The Killers {{reworked}} {{the song}} for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. [...] "Achtung Baby was U2's 'Holy shit!' moment," [...] remarked drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. [...] "I {{was in high school}} when it came out and we'd drive around in my friend's mom's car and rock that shit all the time. When we were asked to record a cover, 'Ultraviolet' was a unanimous choice. It's reassuring to know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> took it back to the rock song underneath." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} Whiskey Rebellion, actress-playwright Susanna Rowson wrote a stage musical about the insurrection {{entitled}} The Volunteers, with music by composer Alexander Reinagle. The play is now lost, but the songs survive {{and suggest that}} Rowson's interpretation was pro-Federalist. The musical celebrates as American heroes the militiamen who put down the rebellion, the [...] "volunteers" [...] of the title. President Washington and Martha Washington attended a performance of the play in Philadelphia in January 1795. W. C. Fields recorded a comedy track in Les Paul's studio in 1946, shortly before his death, entitled [...] "The Temperance Lecture" [...] for the album W. C. Fields... His Only Recording Plus 8 Songs by Mae West. The bit discussed Washington and his role in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion, and Fields wondered aloud whether [...] "George put <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the vile stuff too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like {{with some}} of his later Impressions work, Mayfield's lyrics {{reflected}} the social and political concern rising in black America at the time. Mayfield was one of the earliest artists to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle. Mayfield reflected upon this time as a [...] "happening era...when people stopped wearing tuxedos...people were getting <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blainey's {{views were}} echoed by some politicians. In August 1988, John Howard, then {{opposition}} leader, launched the One Australia policy, stating {{that he believed}} the rate of Asian immigration into Australia should be slowed down {{for the sake of}} social cohesion. He stated: [...] "I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, McCain {{appeared}} {{confident that}} he would be the Republican nominee. Estimates showed him with 707 delegates - nearly 60% of the total needed to win the nomination. He began to appeal to disaffected conservatives, saying: [...] "We share the common principles and values and ideas for {{the future of this country}} based on a fundamental conservative political philosophy, which has been my record." [...] He also suggested that the right wing of the party [...] "calm <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit" [...] and begin to look for areas of agreement. Meanwhile, Romney advisers privately expressed doubts about whether their candidate could realistically hope to defeat McCain, and it was unclear if Romney would spend significant money on key February 12 contests in Virginia and Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement. I ducked <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E

2500|$|The glider had a simple, wide, {{rectangular}} {{cross section}} fuselage with four cross braced longerons forming trusses. It was skinned with two-ply, {{with a final}} fabric covering. From the side the nose was smoothly rounded into a single curvature form with the open cockpit behind it, placing the pilot's seat close to quarter chord. [...] Aft the depth decreased and the tailplane {{was attached to the}} top with the fuselage ending at the coincident elevator and rudder hinges. The horizontal tail surfaces were roughly rectangular and the elevator was a single piece structure. [...] The fin was a quadrant and the rudder almost semicircular but cut away below for elevator movement. All the tail surfaces were wood framed and fabric covered. The Stehaufchen's undercarriage was a parallel pair of skids, intended to protect the low set lower wing on take-off and landings. The unusually broad fuselage enabled the skids to be separated by [...] [...] These were ash, laminated and of double curvature attached at three points, one below the pilot's feet and the others below each wing spar. The final section behind the rear mounting point curved <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to protect the tail.|$|E
2500|$|As {{expected}} and predicted by several music publications, the band adopted {{a very different}} style for the touring in support of Pretty. Odd., {{in contrast to the}} dark, circus-themed elements of the band's previous stage shows. Each show contained [...] "woodsy set pieces, projections of flora and fauna, and mic stands wrapped in lights and flowers," [...] and each band member dressed in a vest. While reflecting on the theatrical nature of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out touring, Urie commented [...] "We did it and {{it was a lot of}} fun when we did it, but this time around I think we wanted to get back to a more intimate, personal setting, and scale it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." [...] Ryan Ross explained that [...] "It's more about connecting with the audience and seeing what's gonna happen every night. It's not as scripted out and pre-planned. It makes it more exciting for us, and less monotonous every night." [...] A live album, ...Live in Chicago, based on live recordings from Chicago during the Honda Civic Tour, was released December 2, 2008. An accompanying DVD contains photos from the tour, each music video from the album as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the videos and the tour, the short film Panic! at the Disco In: American Valley, and the documentary feature based on the tour, All In A Day's.|$|E
2500|$|Colter {{explained}} that in Luke Cage, {{the character is}} [...] "trying to basically stay off the radar", but an event in the series' second episode, described as [...] "hard to watch", [...] "get this series into forward action mode ... There were events that needed to happen to make [...] see that he couldn’t {{just sit back and}} do nothing." [...] Coker said the arc for Cage in the season was [...] "hero", [...] "How does one become a hero? What does one feel about being a hero? How does one live their life and eventually go through the [...] until the acceptance is fine, I’m a hero?" [...] He felt this was a natural way of introducing the character, rather than the more traditional origin story of other Marvel properties, and differentiated the show {{from the rest of the}} MCU. Coker had plotted the story of the first four episodes before the show's writers room began work, but had initially done so over two or three episodes, with the event at the end of the second episode originally taking place at the end of the first. Loeb and Marvel's Karim Zreik told Coker to [...] "slow it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit", which led to an approach that Coker compared to Unforgiven where [...] "you keep building little moments of what Luke can do but he hasn’t really engaged yet." ...|$|E
