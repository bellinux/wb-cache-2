40|$|Discrimination between "self ' and "non-self ' is the {{cornerstone}} upon which immunology is built. Thus, self-antigens are by definition nonimmunogenic; moreover, haptens coupled to self-carriers are generally quite tolerogenic. This is best exemplified by the superior tolerogenicity of haptenated isologous serum proteins and cells (1 - 5). ~ On the other hand, the conjugation ofhaptens to <b>isologous</b> <b>protein</b> or cellular carriers may create new antigenic determinants, which can be immunogenic (6, 7) under certain conditions. For example, the exposure of mouse lymphocytes to haptenated syngeneic spleen cells in vitro induces the generation of cytotoxic T cells directed at hapten-modified H- 2 determinants (7). Since we had previously shown that haptenated spleen cells are excellent tolerogens in vivo for a humoral immune response (5), 1 it appeared that hapten-modified self lymphoid cells may produce differential B-cell tolerance and T-cell immunity. In the present report, we have tested this prediction. Our results suggest that, in the same culture, trinitrophenylated (TNP) -spleen cells will block the humoral response to TNP while inducing a cytotoxic T-cell response. The importance of the differential perception and response to modified self by various lymphocyte subpopulations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Foreign {{proteins}} {{have been}} {{compared with their}} corresponding <b>isologous</b> and autologous <b>proteins</b> {{with respect to their}} capacity to induce inflammatory reactions at the site of injection in the skin. In contrast to the foreign proteins, which consistently produced mild reactions which were morphologically similar to the delayed hypersensitivity reaction, autologous and <b>isologous</b> <b>proteins</b> failed to induce local accumulations of inflammatory cells. The capacity of cells at the inflammatory site to phagocytoze heterologous and isologous ferritin was investigated in the electron microscope, and no qualitative differences were noted. The results are interpreted as evidence for the existence of a local mechanism capable of differentiating between foreign and autologous protein. The possible significance and role of such a mechanism is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The role of carrier in both {{elicitation}} of anti-hapten antibody {{responses and}} generation of hapten-specific memory in chickens were studied using dinitrophenyl (DNP) conjugate of T-independent antigen carrier (DNP [...] Ficoll), that of <b>isologous</b> serum <b>protein</b> DNP [...] chicken serum albumin (CSA), and heavily conjugated DNP [...] bovine gammaglobulin (BGG). All of these DNP [...] conjugates could generate DNP specific memory as markedly as moderately conjugated DNP [...] BGG. Both DNP [...] Ficoll and DNP [...] CSA hardly elicited {{the primary and}} secondary anti-DNP antibody responses. Heavily conjugated DNP [...] BGG did not elicit a significant primary anti-DNP response as moderately conjugated DNP [...] BGG. It is suggested therefore that, when chickens are stimulated with hapten-carrier conjugates, hapten-specific memory is generated independently of T-cell function, but the elicitation of both the primary and secondary anti-hapten antibody responses is somehow relevant to T-cell function, although the T-cell dependence is less marked in the secondary than in the primary response...|$|R
