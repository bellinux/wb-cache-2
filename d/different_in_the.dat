While the pairs of the monochrome {{male and female}} figures above the spandrels are mirrors of each other, these Ignudi are all <b>different.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> earliest paintings, they are paired, their poses being similar but with variation. These variations become greater with each pair until the postures of the final four bear no relation to each other whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Yarrell {{was aware}} of earlier bird handbooks, {{especially}} Bewick's. A History of British Birds used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804).

An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|From {{a base of}} {{territory}} in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth {{and south of the}} River Oykel, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the English-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of Gaelic-speaking Galloway and Norse-speaking Caithness; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water.

The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are <b>different</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E
5|$|The {{novelisation}} and the screenplay, {{although both}} written by Wood, are somewhat <b>different.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E

Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E

25|$|The {{typology}} of scarabs {{similar to the}} Sinis specimen began to be produced during the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt, then continuing in the New Kingdom, especially during the Twentieth dynasty (ca. 1187-1064 BC).
