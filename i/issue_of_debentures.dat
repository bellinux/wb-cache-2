Sultan Sir Idris Shah from plans prepared by Mr. Lefroy in 1893, was opened in the following year. The building scheme was financed by the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>debentures</b> to the value of 10,000 dollars, nearly the whole of which has now been paid off. The clubhouse overlooks the cricket and football grounds, and affords a magnificent view of the Taiping Hills.

When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous maître d'hôtel, M.

50|$|After the WWII, the Fanling {{property}} had badly {{suffered from}} general neglect which was understandable in the circumstances. The trees {{had been cut}} down for fuel {{and parts of the}} course including most of the greens had been used for vegetable cultivation. The New Course had been used for training and a large number of fox holes had been built. The clubhouse was requisitioned by the British Army after the war. The rehabilitation was as expensive as had been forecast. The Club not only spent all its account balances but had to arrange for an overdraft which at one time was over $400,000. (The price of daily newspaper in Hong Kong was 20 cents in 1947/48.) To reduce this liability a debenture issue was authorised on the basis of HK$500 per member. A few of the long established firms such as the Hong Kong Bank and Jardines also took up a number of the debentures to aid the Club. In 1963, an EGM was called and a Fanling Development Scheme was approved. Two resolutions were passed authorising the Committee to proceed with a scheme for the extension of the Fanling clubhouse and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>debentures</b> to the amount of HK$900,000 to cover the costs. A building levy of HK$5 per month for all members was also introduced. Actual and estimated capital expenditure on the improvement to the clubhouse totalled HK$1,214,000. In early 1970s, to raise capital for the new complex, including the swimming pool and the mixed accommodation, a scheme of Nominee Memberships was introduced. On payment of HK$5,000 - soon raised to HK$10,000 - a firm became entitled, after approval by the Club, to nominate an employee to membership. The Nominee Memberships were transferable, again subject to the Club's approval, on payment of a commission to the Club. At the AGM in 1980, it was decided to issue 30 Nominee Memberships to meet the expense of a redevelopment scheme to include a swimming pool and squash courts in Deep Water Bay. The new building at Deep Water Bay was completed in early 1983 {{at a cost of about}} HK$25 million. The financial problems were eventually overcome. Following many years of loss, a profit was reported in 1984 for the third year running. Since then, the Club has remained in the black.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> {{convertible}} <b>debentures</b> in India {{in recent}} years provide for a mandatory conversion <b>of</b> the <b>debentures</b> into an unspecified number of shares at an unspecified time; the conversion ratio (i. e., the number <b>of</b> shares per <b>debenture)</b> is {{to be determined by}} the Controller <b>of</b> Capital <b>Issues</b> (CCI). There are serious problems in arriving at a rational value for these "indeterminate convertibles". Even if the investor can make some estimate of the likely conversion terms, there is no valuation model available to arrive at a price. This paper applies the general theory of derivative securities (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross, 1985) to obtain a valuation model for these instruments. The model shows that the naive valuation model which sets the value <b>of</b> the <b>debenture</b> equal to the current stock price times the expected conversion ratio {{is likely to be a}} significant overestimate of the price. It also shows that changes in the stock price lead to less than proportionate changes in the debenture price unlike in the case of pre-specified conversion terms. Similarly, the CAPM beta <b>of</b> the <b>debenture</b> would be significantly lower than that of the share. While the model does not obviate the need for obtaining estimates of unobservable parameters related to the market expectations about the likely conversion ratio, the qualitative insights given by the model are quite useful. The model is successful in explaining some of the empirical patterns and anomalies that have been observed in ongoing empirical research into the market prices <b>of</b> these <b>debentures.</b> ...|$|R

This study argues that the new Basel III Accord and the ensuing EU Capital Requirements Directive IV fail to correct the two main shortcomings of international prudential rules: 1) reliance on banks’ risk management models for the calculation of capital requirements and 2) the lack of accountability by supervisors. Accordingly, the authors propose the calculation of capital requirements without risk adjustment and creation of a system of mandated action by supervisors modelled on the US framework of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA).
