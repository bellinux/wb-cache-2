5|$|Although {{not a major}} characteristic, Mahone is {{depicted}} as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael {{at the beginning of}} season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds.|$|E
25|$|Giving {{the lack}} of an {{auditory}} communication medium, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> just how easily used and effective these types of underwater communication tools can be for the buddy team when they are fully utilized.|$|E
25|$|Bearing in mind Fillingham's {{expertise}} in these matters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that while the}} enclosure map (by William Attenburrow of East Stoke, covering 769 acres or about 300 hectares), is dated 1792, the Award itself was not signed until as late as 27 June 1795.|$|E
50|$|Given DTC's {{outstanding}} {{torque control}} performance, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that ABB's first servo drive family, the ACSM1, was only introduced in 2007.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how {{considerate}} the handsome, hot-headed Arturo remained, restrained always by {{the quiet}} persuasions of the firm, quiet Doña Maria.|$|R
60|$|So the {{two women}} {{returned}} to Woodhouse by the tram-car, while Ciccio rode home on his bicycle. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how little Madame and Alvina found to say to one another.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> {{how often}} oscillatory flow {{phenomenon}} have Strouhal numbers in this range. For shape comparison, the Strouhal number for an ellipse has been measured at 0.218, a cylinder at 0.188, a square at 0.160, and a triangle at 0.214. The characteristic dimension {{is that of}} the object lateral to the flow and the characteristic speed {{is that of the}} impinging flow.|$|E
25|$|The nursing {{environment}} {{is full of}} event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. Simple tasks such as remembering to order a drug or calling patient's family and remembering when to switch shifts are just some examples of a nurse's reliance on prospective memory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that not much {{research has been done}} concerning the importance of prospective memory in nurses since they face many life-threatening tasks.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times in}} the 1960s and 1970s plans were made to connect Wrzeszcz with Kokoszki and Kartuzy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that this line was not rebuilt and electrified, as the cost was {{relatively}} modest. A more ambitious project called for a Seaside SKM that was to run from Zaspa Towarowa to Sopot, east of the existing line, to relieve pressure on the crowded (Sopot - Gdańsk) section.|$|E
60|$|This remark irritated Miriam a little; Ralph saw the irritation, and {{was sorry}} {{that he had}} made the remark. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how easily Miriam was irritated by {{references}} to Dora.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>{{surprising}}</b> <b>was</b> that at 23.36 hours, the compere Kike Morandé {{was hoping}} that the total would exceed 5 billion pesos. The count yielded the surprising figure of $ 5,083,326,540, which meant that the goal would soon be reached.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas S. Hischak wrote, [...] "With {{enthusiastic}} reviews, {{an outstanding}} score, and a powerhouse cast {{of some of}} the finest African Americans in the business, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> the musical did not run longer than twenty weeks." ...|$|R
25|$|All tracklaying had {{to start}} {{from one end of}} the line, to ensure the rack was {{correctly}} aligned; so although the first locomotives were delivered in July 1895 very little track was laid until August, when the two large viaducts between Llanberis and Waterfall were completed. Progress up the mountain was then quite rapid, with the locomotives being used to move materials as required. Considering the exposed location and possible effects of bad weather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that the first train reached the summit in January 1896. As the fencing and signals were not then ready, the opening was set for Easter.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{correlations}} can be {{made between}} the number of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000species, compared to the 1080remaining gymnosperms. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that the cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{originally}} also the smoking room, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that the original}} painted ceiling has survived and could be fully restored. The ceiling is heavily painted, gilded and sculptured in an eclectic manner, taking its general design from classical sources. The background is cream, but there is much use of Pompeiian red, an earth colour which gained popularity in Victorian England after the renewed excavations by Giuseppe Fiorelli in 1860. Small panels feature clearly painted classical motifs and portraits with distressed backgrounds, to look like pieces of ancient frescoes. Four medallions show the named poets Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer and Tennyson, all admired by the Romantics. All the spaces on the cream background are filled with illustrations imitating the original maiolica style, featuring stylised goats and fauns, cornucopia, grapes, birds and flowers, but also angels and putti in the centre. The decoration around the edge has a Green Man.|$|E
60|$|She was not {{supposed}} to be a rich woman, and she had not been much engaged in suits at law, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how much legal business Miss Panney had, as well as business of many other kinds.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{perhaps not}} <b>surprising</b> that {{the writers of}} Moby Dick, The American Practical Navigator, and Two Years Before the Mast <b>were</b> Merchant Mariners. <b>It</b> might <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> that the writers of Borat, A Hard Day's Night, and Cool Hand Luke were.|$|R
60|$|When our {{men went}} into their huts, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising,</b> indeed, {{to see the}} vast stock of wealth they had got, in gold and silver and jewels, which, however, they told us was a trifle to what Captain Avery had, {{wherever}} he was gone.|$|R
500|$|Hodgson's lawyer, Julian Young, {{said the}} confessions had been vital {{information}} {{which could have}} freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. [...] "If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or to me {{as part of the}} appeal, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> and very disappointing. This may raise serious questions about {{the way in which the}} police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. I did not know seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{believed}} that novels should be [...] "probable" [...] and depict [...] "moderation, reason, and contentment". Thus <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that The Wrongs of Woman draws inspiration from {{works such as}} Ann Radcliffe's A Sicilian Romance (1790) and relies on gothic conventions such as the literal and figurative [...] "mansion of despair" [...] to which Maria is consigned. But it does so to demonstrate that gothic horrors are a reality for the average Englishwoman. Using elements of the gothic, Wollstonecraft can, for example, portray Maria's husband as tyrannical and married life as wretched. As Wollstonecraft herself writes in the [...] "Preface" [...] to The Wrongs of Woman: ...|$|E
500|$|The annal for 571 reads: [...] "Here Cuthwulf {{fought against}} the Britons at Bedcanford, and took four settlements: Limbury and Aylesbury, Benson and Eynsham; {{and in the same}} year he passed away." [...] Cuthwulf's {{relationship}} with Ceawlin is unknown, but the alliteration common to Anglo-Saxon royal families suggests Cuthwulf may be part of the West Saxon royal line. [...] The location of the battle itself is unidentified. [...] It has been suggested that it was Bedford, but what is known of the early history of Bedford's names, does not support this. [...] This battle is of interest because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that an area so far east should still be in Briton hands this late: there is ample archaeological evidence of early Saxon and Anglian presence in the Midlands, and historians generally have interpreted Gildas's De Excidio as implying that the Britons had lost control of this area by the mid-sixth century. [...] One possible explanation is, that this annal records a reconquest of land that was lost to the Britons in the campaigns ending in the battle of Mons Badonicus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> perhaps <b>surprising</b> that lambda-calculus can {{represent}} any ...|$|R
25|$|Nanog: In {{embryonic}} stem cells, Nanog, along with Oct-3/4 and Sox2, {{is necessary in}} promoting pluripotency. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> when Yamanaka et al. reported that Nanog was unnecessary for induction although Thomson et al. has reported <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to generate iPS cells with Nanog {{as one of the}} factors.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how plainly I {{could hear}} Mary Phillips across the smooth, still water. The ships did not {{now seem to}} be moving at all; but soon they would be nearer, and then I could talk with Bertha. And soon after (<b>it</b> must <b>be</b> so) I would be with her.|$|R
500|$|The poor sales caused {{financial}} problems {{and may have}} caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told {{a meeting of the}} corporation that there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, and she tried to get paid even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, [...] "given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all {{well-known}} algebraic structures {{other than}} Boolean algebras are undecidable. Hence <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that Tarski's student [...] {{proved that the}} first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, {{but there are still}} many areas of current research: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{view of his}} {{opposition}} to the Conspiracy bill, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that Palmerston offered Gilpin a job in his 1859 Government and that Gilpin accepted, having negotiated {{that he would not be}} bound by the party whip. The job was Secretary of the Poor Law Board. This appointment did not please his fellow Quaker, John Bright MP, who remarked [...] "Thou'd better have a rope put around your neck". Gilpin served until 1865.|$|E
60|$|During {{the fight}} he, Colonel Macdonald, and Colonel Maxwell had ridden {{at the head}} of their brigades, the white regimental {{officers}} being on foot with the men, as was their custom; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that the three conspicuous figures had all come through the storm of fire unscathed.|$|R
30|$|For the anthropometric {{data and}} the cause of death, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that persons who died from chest trauma had higher average weight than other traumas {{statistical}} significantly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> possible that the chest is a prominent and wide target area in the man with large body. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>surprising</b> that the deceased who was dead from blunt force injury had lower weight than the other types of force statistical significantly. This could be because the smaller persons have a tendency to be assaulted or bullied by others (White and Mason 2012).|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> to some to {{find the}} F-16 {{the winner of the}} UAE's {{high-end}} fighter competition, beating both the Dassault Rafale and F-15 Eagle. The key was a highly advanced configuration that became the F-16E/F-60, with the UAE as its first customer. A total of 80 aircraft were ordered.|$|R
2500|$|Rosie, a {{black and}} white {{portrait}} of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed child pornography by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art in 1988. There was one other photograph of a naked child, [...] "Jessie McBride" [...] which also contributed to the controversy created by [...] "Rosie".|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{of closed}} {{railways}} often diminishes or disappears entirely, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that {{remnants of a}} line closed {{over a hundred years}} have actually been noted to still exist. [...] The embankment from which the branch curved away from the Main South Line is visible from both the railway and nearby road, and although obscured by vegetation, other embankments and cuttings can still be seen. [...] Remnants of the Millers Bay viaduct have so far survived the sea and can still be seen {{at the foot of the}} cliff beside which the railway once ran. [...] It is possible to walk along the formation of some of the branch's path.|$|E
2500|$|... saw a 'Return to Power' as Formula One {{changed the}} engine rules once again, {{allowing}} engines of 3.0-litre normally aspirated, or 1.5-litre supercharged or forced induction. 1966 was a transitional year for most teams, however, the year did {{see the first}} use of composite materials, a technology which would later revolutionise the sport. The McLaren M2B, designed by Robin Herd, used an aluminium-wood laminate known as Mallite for much of its monocoque, although the car's design did not make best use of the new material. Given the shift to 1500cc forced induction, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> that any teams did not seriously consider fielding turbocharged versions of their 1500cc naturally aspirated engines right from that point, Coventry Climax had considered it for their FWMW flat 16, but the company had decided to end its Formula 1 racing activities and the idea stopped there. It would be Eleven years before a team exploited the 1500cc forced induction option again.|$|E
5000|$|Evelyn Waugh also {{speculated that}} Beerbohm {{had made a}} mariage blanc with Florence Kahn, but added: [...] "Beerbohm remarked of Ruskin that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> he should marry, without knowing he was impotent." [...] Waugh also observed, [...] "the {{question}} is of little importance in an artist of Beerbohm's quality." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that the}} Byzantine Empire {{was able to}} survive, given its {{internal}} conflicts, the speedy collapse of the Sassanid Empire under Arab threat, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> being threatened simultaneously on two fronts. However {{the strength of the}} military organisation within the empire, and factional struggles within the Arab world enabled this situation.|$|R
50|$|Journalist Fausto Malavé {{told the}} Venezuelan {{opposition}} press that the recording was an evident parody {{that had been}} circulating in city streets {{for at least two}} months, claiming that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only brought to public attention then. He also expressed concern at the significance that <b>was</b> attributed to <b>it</b> by the CNE.|$|R
