50|$|They set a trap to {{lock the}} apes in an old {{ammunition}} <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> before detonating the munitions, but the Delta team's entrance {{with the rest of}} the DARPA team (who deactivate the gorillas' neural chips) changes the situation.|$|R
50|$|Munitions <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> are {{designed}} to securely store explosive ordnance, and contain any internal explosions. The most common configuration for high explosives storage is the igloo shaped bunker. They are often built into a hillside {{in order to provide}} additional containment mass.|$|R
50|$|Today {{some of the}} Depot’s {{buildings}} remain, {{including the}} ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> and {{less than half of}} the PMQs. The camp chapel is now a Baptist church and Sergeants’ Mess was relocated off site, for use as the South Portage Recreation Center.|$|R
50|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009 the {{remaining}} buildings were demolished over four months (the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> pictured in this article). Some of the World War II aircraft hardstands, {{part of the}} old airfield perimeter track, and the northwest end of a secondary runway exist.|$|R
50|$|Waste from households, Local Authority {{services}} and some local businesses {{is brought to}} the ERF. It is tipped into a waste <b>storage</b> <b>bunker.</b> From the bunker the waste is lifted into a feed hopper by an overhead crane {{at a rate of}} 28 tonnes per hour.|$|R
50|$|Throsk was {{formerly}} {{the site of}} the Royal Navy's Bandeath armaments depot. This closed in 1978 and now serves as an industrial estate owned by the local council. Many of the original munitions <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> remain in situ as does a loading crane beside the River Forth.|$|R
50|$|Al Muthanna {{essentially}} ceased {{production in}} December 1990 and refocused resources on dispersing Chemical Weapons stockpiles and equipment for {{protection against the}} anticipated bombing campaigns, which started in January 1991.During the Gulf War, production laboratories and facilities were destroyed. In addition one <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> was destroyed because of secondary explosion, and two others bunkers were severely damaged.|$|R
50|$|Further, {{their regular}} {{geometry}} and small size allow automatic feeding with very fine calibration. They can be fed to a burner by auger feeding or by pneumatic conveying. Their high density also permits compact {{storage and transport}} over long distance. They can be conveniently blown from a tanker to a <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> or silo on a customer's premises.|$|R
50|$|Coal is {{delivered}} via a railroad by 100-car trains, each carrying 10,000 tons of coal. At the plant, an automated unloading trestle empties the train in about 30 minutes and conveyor belts move the coal to the storage pile or the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> inside the plant. The bunkers hold a 14-hour reserve; the coal pile target inventory is a 32-day supply.|$|R
50|$|Decommissioned in 1992, all 58 cavern <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> and the {{extensive}} above ground network of storage sheds {{and other military}} buildings remain in place. Ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Anglo-Irish consortium Omega Pacific in 1998, and then by court order to the Manhattan Loft Corporation in 2002. The site is being redeveloped as an industrial park.|$|R
50|$|On 28 October 1969 the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 3rd Division began a {{siege of}} the Camp, Landing Zone Kate and Duc Lap Camp. On 1 November when Kate was {{abandoned}} the forces evacuated towards Bu Prang. On 18 November 1969 PAVN mortar fire destroyed the Camp's ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>bunker.</b> The siege {{was broken by}} the ARVN on 16 December 1969.|$|R

50|$|Risley Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) was {{a filling}} factory. It {{received}} the explosives in bulk, usually by rail, from other ROFs {{where they were}} manufactured. Risley specialised in filling them into the various casings to produce the finished munitions. There were 16 filling factories {{around the country and}} Risley was known as Filling Factory No. 6. Others in the north west included Chorley (No. 1) and Kirkby (No. 7). One of the features common to all of the filling factories was an area of <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> where the finished munitions were stored awaiting dispatch. The areas within the filling factories were all numbered in the same way. <b>Storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> were designated Area 9. Risley had 20 such bunkers and Area 9 is roughly {{in the area of the}} main field in Birchwood Forest Park today. When the new town area of Birchwood was created, most of the bunkers were demolished, but 4 of them were left in place and can still be seen today.|$|R
25|$|The common was {{converted}} to parkland {{under the terms}} of the Metropolitan Commons Act in 1878. As London expanded in the 19th century, Clapham was absorbed into the capital, with most of the remaining palatial or agricultural estates replaced with terraced housing by the early 1900s. During World War II, <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> were built on the Battersea Rise side of the common; two mounds remain.|$|R

50|$|This {{is where}} the name Horrocks Highway takes over from the {{historic}} name of Main North Road. The environment changes from the urban environment to undulating land, mostly cleared for grain cropping. Several of the towns have grain <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> or silos. It crosses the Light River then crosses and follows the Gilbert River to where the Barrier Highway branches northeast towards Riverton and Burra.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937 two munitions {{factories}} were built: [...] "Dynamit Aktien Gesellschaft" [...] and [...] "Deutsche Sprengchemie" [...] in the boroughs of what {{is today}} Gartenberg and Stein. Towards {{the end of the}} war, these factories employed slave and foreign labourers. Today, the remains of <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers,</b> administrative buildings, and other remains are scattered throughout the town. In May 1945 the American air force bombed the factories.|$|R
25|$|In the Oklahoma City area, the General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly {{sustained}} major damage as did as {{a manufacturing}} plant near Interstate 240 where F4 damage was observed. Several other businesses were either damaged or destroyed. At Tinker Air Force Base, a <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> and several fences were damaged. Several subdivisions in eastern Oklahoma City, Choctaw and Midwest City were also affected by the tornado with several homes sustaining significant damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{industrial}} park comprises {{land that was}} once an ammunition plant known as the Volunteer Army Ammunitions Plant (VAAP), which manufactured up to 30000000 lb of TNT (trinitrotoluene) per month for World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. [...] The Volkswagen facility is near a remaining <b>storage</b> <b>bunker,</b> once used to store TNT. [...] The site features nearby hiking, biking and walking trails, picnic areas, and overlooks.|$|R
50|$|Returning to Singapore, Lim {{became an}} expert on fungi and built up a unique {{repository}} of the region's fungal species, writing hundreds of research articles and consulting with universities and businesses at home and abroad. She worked on the advisory board of a company developing medicinal mushrooms, and assisted the Singaporean Ministry of Defence when their <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> developed mould. After her retirement, the collection of various species was disassembled and destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{subdivision}} [...] "Byford on the Scarp" [...] {{was constructed}} {{on the long}} time disused RAN Armament Depot. The depot was closed in 1981 and its functions relocated to Garden Island. After standing empty and neglected for many years, the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> and other depot buildings were progressively demolished; this work being complete in 2000. Traces of the rail infrastructure that once served the depot and brickworks still are visible today.|$|R
50|$|Coal is {{coarsely}} crushed at {{the mine}} then crushed {{again at the}} plant as it travels to the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> inside the boiler house. A pulverizer below each bunker grinds the coal to a fine powder that is mixed with air and blown into the boiler through a network of pipes. With both units at full load, Plant Wansley burns about 14,000 tons of coal every 24 hours. Annual consumption averages four to five million tons.|$|R
50|$|Brown and Root's Highland Resources {{would later}} {{transform}} the depot into an industrial park catering primarily to defense contractors {{who could be}} enticed by the local eight-mile (13 km) long rocket range, the vast array of underground <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers,</b> highly specialized building infrastructure, low cost of labor and excellent railroad system. As part of the transfer agreement, the Brown Foundation also donated 70 acre of land and six buildings to establish a two-year technical college now known as Southern Arkansas University Tech.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{continued}} between 1965 and 1970, {{with a new}} maintenance hangar, {{baggage claim}} facility, 5-story hotel, a second runway, and new oil <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> added to the airport's infrastructure. In 1970, approximately 700,000 passengers and 27,000 tonnes of cargo passed through Kuybyshev Airport. By 1971, all the facilities and expansions were completed. In 1972, construction on a training center for flight engineers was completed. That same year, after endurance tests were completed, the second runway was exploited for commercial use.|$|R
40|$|In coal mining, {{spontaneous}} combustion {{can occur in}} many areas such as stockpiles, underground workings, waste dumps, coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. Spontaneous combustion {{has been defined as}} an oxidation reaction, which occurs without an external heat source. Although not limited to coal, the most significant hazard of {{spontaneous combustion}} is the fires that occur in coal mining operations around the world. These fires pose a serious risk to the safety of workers in the coal mines. This phenomenon also has an environmental impact, which can affect {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Extensive research work has been done and recorded about spontaneous combustion in coal stockpiles, dumps and coal faces, but very limited work has been conducted on raw coal <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers.</b> This study investigated the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in coal <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers,</b> and established that there is no single document available that addresses the problem adequately. Therefore, a need was identified to create a guideline with decision analyser steps to be able to arrive quickly at a possible solution to the problem. This work does not address spontaneous combustion in underground workings, waste dumps, stockpiles, coal faces, in-pit ramps and backfill areas. It was found that important factors affecting the possibility of SC occurring were the type of coal being supplied to the bunker, the mining practice with regard to the standing time of the loose cubic metres of coal on the mining benches, and the impact of the physical factors around the bunker. The information obtained could be of great significance when designing or trying to solve spontaneous combustion problems in raw coal <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers.</b> The guideline and decision analyser steps can be applied early in the phase of the project in order to minimise or eliminate similar mistakes made in the industry over the years.

50|$|In Flynn's {{previous}} novel, Memorial Day, CIA counter-terror operative and assassin Mitch Rapp uncovered an Al-Qaeda plot to use {{a nuclear}} weapon obtained from abandoned Russian nuclear <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers.</b> The ultimate goal was the destruction of Washington, D.C., and Rapp was forced to torture the only man who knew {{the details of the}} plan: Waheed Abdullah. Rapp then faked Waheed's death to prevent the Saudi Government from learning of it and rescuing him, while preserving a useful source for himself. To keep Waheed from being discovered, Rapp puts him in an Afghan prison.|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Supply {{began using}} Site 3, to the {{southeast}} of Eastriggs, in the 1930s for ammunition storage. The 1250 acre site was known as CAD Eastriggs. Ammunition was transported from the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> within CAD Eastriggs using a narrow gauge railway system. Two of the petrol locomotives were used on the Duchal Moor grouse railway near Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire. The site {{was connected to the}} Glasgow and South Western Railway at a junction at Eastriggs. In the 1960s, CAD Eastriggs became a sub-depot of CAD Longtown.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consisted}} of two areas: the Inland Area (5028 acre), which is within the Concord city limits, and the Tidal Area (7630 acre). Because of changes in military operations, parts of the Inland Area began to be , and by 1999 the station had only a minimal contingent of military personnel and contained mainly empty ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers,</b> empty warehouses, and disused support structures. In 2007 the U.S. federal government announced that the Inland Area of the Naval station would be closed. The Tidal area of the base was not scheduled for closure.|$|R
