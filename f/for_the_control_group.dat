The extent of {{familial}} clustering can be evaluated in Iceland with its large population-based genealogical database. METHODS AND RESULTS: Applying several measures of familiality we demonstrated that 750 women with endometriosis were significantly more interrelated than matched <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> risk ratio <b>for</b> sisters was 5. 20 (P < 0. 001) and for cousins 1. 56 (P = 0. 003). The average kinship coefficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patients {{was significantly higher than}} that calculated for 1000 sets of 750 matched controls (P < 0. 001) and this remained significant when contribution from first-degree relatives was excluded (P < 0. 05).

50|$|Difference in {{differences}} (DID or DD) is {{a statistical}} technique used in econometrics and quantitative {{research in the}} social sciences that attempts to mimic an experimental research design using observational study data, by studying the differential effect of a treatment on a 'treatment group' versus a 'control group' in a natural experiment. It calculates the effect of a treatment (i.e., an explanatory variable or an independent variable) on an outcome (i.e., a response variable or dependent variable) by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group, compared to the average change over time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Although it is intended to mitigate the effects of extraneous factors and selection bias, depending on how the treatment group is chosen, this method may still be subject to certain biases (e.g. mean regression, reverse causality and omitted variable bias).|$|E

50|$|There was no {{consistency}} {{observed in}} clinical results relating chromium(III) picolinate to adequate treatment of type 2 diabetes. This {{is due to}} the degree of glucose intolerance of patients that participate in the clinical studies. Glucose intolerance is a gradient and the intensity is affected by ethnicity, degree of obesity, age, distribution of body fat and many other factors. In some studies, low dosages of the supplement were given, however, a suitable amount of chromium(III) picolinate must be administrated to a person before any appreciable drop in glucose levels are observed due to differing levels of insulin resistance. Another important point to mention is that diabetes is not always caused by glucose intolerance. As mentioned before, Cr(III) has been shown to only influence glucose intolerance and not insulin levels. Furthermore, the environments in which the studies were performed were not consistent. The levels of stress, diets consumed by patients and patient genetics were variable among study subjects. This is also true of the controls amongst different studies in which the subjects having diabetes were already being treated {{with a wide variety of}} antidiabetic drugs, which can reduce the effects of chromium on affecting insulin activity. This could explain why animal studies tend to yield more positive results owing to the fact that these diabetic animals were not treated with antidiabetic drugs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Also, as mentioned in the absorption and excretion section, the absorption/bioavailability of chromium(III) picolinate is influenced by the diet. Collectively, these different factors have contributed to the variability in the studies.|$|E
