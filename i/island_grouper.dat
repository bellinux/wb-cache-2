50|$|Mycteroperca fusca, the <b>Island</b> <b>grouper</b> or comb grouper, is {{a species}} of grouper from the family Serranidae which is endemic to the Macaronesian Islands in the eastern Atlantic. It is claissified as {{endangered}} in The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.|$|E
40|$|Mycteroperca fusca {{is one of}} {{the main}} predators of the Canarian {{archipelago}} coastal marine ecosystem. Nothing is known on the life history or population dynamics of this predatory serranid fish. In this study, age and growth of M. fusca were investigated by annual growth increment counts from 214 fish collected between January 2004 and December 2005. A year’s growth is represented by one opaque and one translucent ring. The <b>island</b> <b>grouper</b> is a slow-growing and long-lived species, with ages up to twenty years recorded. Length at age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 898 mm; k= 0. 062 year- 1; and t 0 = − 3. 83 year), the Schnute growth model (y 1 = 262 mm; y 2 = 707 mm; a= 0. 008; and b= 1. 98), and the seasonalised von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 908 mm; k= 0. 061 year- 1; t 0 = − 3. 83 year; C= 2. 58; and ts= 0. 542). Males and females show differences in growth...|$|E
40|$|An adult {{specimen}} of Mycteroperca sp. previously unrecorded was {{collected from the}} Azores Islands. Based on comparison of morphological characters and the cytochrome bmitochondrial gene, the specimen was identi¢ed as the western Atlantic species M. phenax, a species previously unrecorded from the central or eastern Atlantic Ocean. The Azores archipelago, located from 368550 N 25801 W to 398430 N 318150 W, are the most isolated islands in the North Atlantic, approximately 1000 nautical {{miles from the nearest}} continent. Despite major oceanographic current £ow from west to east, the Azorean marine ichthyofauna fauna has stronger biogeographic a⁄nities with the eastern Atlantic than the west mainly with the archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, {{and to a lesser extent}} with continental coasts of north-west Africa, southern Europe, and the Mediterranean (Santos et al., 1995). Mycteroperca Gill, 1863 (Serranidae: Epinephelinae) is a wide-ranging genus with 15 currently recognized species: two in the eastern Atlantic, eight in the western Atlantic and ¢ve in the eastern Paci¢c (Heemstra & Randall, 1993). In the Azores and the eastern Atlantic the genus is represented by only one species in each of those areas; the <b>island</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca fusca Lowe, 1836 and mottled grouper M. rubra Bloch, 1793, respectively (Heemstra & Randall, 1993). In this paper we report the occur-rence of an unknown Mycteroperca species in the north-easter...|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} includes Working on phylogeography, speciation {{and molecular}} ecology of fishes, {{and particularly in}} fishes lacking a pelagic larval phase, Gulf of California and Pacific disjunct species, and in surfperches (Embiotocidae). His research compares phylogeographic and gene expression patterns to test for local adaptation in a high gene flow species. He is also interested in populations structure of coastal and <b>island</b> <b>groupers.</b> He also investigates adult population structure {{and the structure of}} a new year-class within Sebastes mystinus (blue rockfish) and Sebastes atrovirens (kelp rockfish) over multiple temporal and spatial scales.

50|$|After {{shakedown}} in Long <b>Island</b> Sound, <b>Grouper</b> sailed for Pearl Harbor on 30 March 1942 to {{join the}} Pacific Submarine Force, which was to play havoc on Japanese shipping. Before departing for her first war patrol, Grouper {{was assigned to the}} submarine screen which ringed the area as the American and Japanese fleets clashed in the decisive Battle of Midway. Patrolling the fringe of the fighting on 4 June, Grouper sighted two burning enemy aircraft carriers, but could not close for attack because of heavy air cover. On that day, she was strafed by fighter planes and driven deep in a series of aircraft and destroyer attacks which saw over 170 depth charges and bombs dropped on the novice submarine. The next day, as the battle still raged, Grouper crash-dived to avoid heavy bombers. She then put in at Midway for three days for fuel and provisions before sailing on her first war patrol on 12 June. She torpedoed and damaged two Japanese maru (civilian) ships before returning to Pearl Harbor on 30 July.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe peacock grouper (Cephalopholis argus) was {{intentionally}} {{introduced to}} the Hawaiian coastal waters 50 years ago to enhance the local fisheries. Following introduction, this species spread rapidly and became extremely abundant. A comparison of the metazoan parasite community of C. argus was performed between its native range (Moorea Island, French Polynesia) and its introduced range (Oahu and Big <b>Island,</b> Hawaii). Polynesian <b>groupers</b> were infected with a highly diversified parasite community whereas Hawaiian groupers exhibited a depauperate ensemble of parasite species, C. argus having lost most of the parasites common in their native range. Interestingly, the grouper has not acquired new parasites present in Hawaiian waters. This study provides the first field evidence of significant parasite release in a wild but previously introduced fish in coral reefs and is discussed {{in relation to the}} Enemy-Release Hypothesis which has never been assessed in those ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} two marine reserves (MRs) in the Canary Islands (eastern Atlantic), called 2 ̆ 2 Punta La Restinga-Mar de Las Calmas 2 ̆ 2 (El Hierro Island) and 2 ̆ 2 Isla La Graciosa e islotes del norte de Lanzarote 2 ̆ 2 (Chinijo Archipelago). Specifically, we evaluated the variability in the abundances and biomasses of four commercially-targeted fish species: the parrotfish (Sparisoma cretense), the <b>island</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca fusca), the white sea-bream (Diplodus sargus cadenati) and the zebra sea-bream Diplodus cervinus cervinus) Four fishing managemente categories were established within and around each MR: (1) a no-take or integral area (collection of all animals is nor permitted), (2) a buffer area (fishing is permitted with traditional fishing gears, (3) a neighbouring fishing area (3 ̆c 20 3 ̆ekm), and (4) a fishing area off a neighbouring island. Two randomly selected sites were sampled within each management category and MR in October and March 2004. Univariate tests provided evidence of a moderate 2 ̆ 2 reserve effect 2 ̆ 2 for both MRs consistent through time. Differences in abundances and biomasses of each species among management categories were clearly species-specific and inconsistent between both MRs. Species of the genus Diplodus showed greater abundances and biomasses within protected locations compared to unprotected locations at El Hierro Island. Moreover, the four selected species showed greater abundances and biomasses in the locations surveyed at El Hierro Island compared to unprotected locations at the neighbouring island. In contrast, S. cretense {{appeared to be the}} only species that benefited from protection in the Chinijo MR. Differences in the sizes of the MRs, the fishing effort around the MRs and the effectiveness of the enforcement withing each MR, appeared to be possible explanations for the patterns observed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to the {{relative}} geographical isolation of Reunion <b>Island</b> the <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus merra {{is assumed to be}} self-recruited but almost nothing is known about its larval history. We used elemental composition of the otoliths (Ba, Sr, Mn, Mg, Na) of fifty-eight one year-old groupers collected from four main coral reefs on the west coast of Reunion Island, to determine environmental variations during their early life history. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the otolith chemical composition of core and early larval phase, allowed the identification of three groups of larvae. Larvae from the first group (cluster 1) were born and dispersed in Ba-enriched water bodies, while the second and third groups included larvae that had crossed Ba-poor water masses. Larvae of group 1 were primarily found in the southern sector (74 %) decreasing northward, while group 3 were more abundant in the northern sector (56 %) and cluster 2 showed a scattered distribution. Such opposite spatial distributions might suggest that clusters 1 and 3 originated from opposite dispersal kernels, south and north respectively. It is possible however that larvae from both groups came from the same spawning ground but represented different cohorts that experienced changing geochemical conditions either at the spawning site or within the surrounding pelagic environment, {{over the course of the}} breeding season. Both scenarios on the origin and dispersion may thus suggest significant influence of hydrographic features causing or preventing larvae from becoming displaced far from their natal area. © 2016 Elsevier B.
