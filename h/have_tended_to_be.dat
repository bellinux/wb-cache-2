5|$|Women <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged {{in some aspects}} of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E
5|$|Away colours <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either white—often {{with black}} shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although {{for a time in}} the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or {{in the event of a}} clash involving both red and white.|$|E

5|$|Reviews {{were widely}} varied for the episode: some {{felt it was}} the best of the third season to date, and others were quite critical, though the overall mix was {{somewhat}} more positive than negative.

5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr.

5000|$|Part of the problem, Graeber claims, is that traditionally, {{academics}} on {{the radical}} left have gravitated toward the more [...] "High Theory"-oriented Marxism (Karl Marx {{himself was a}} PhD) rather than the more practice-oriented anarchism.

25|$|In other {{countries}} in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more numerous and fluid.

25|$|As Branscombe documents, {{the earlier}} {{performances}} were often of highly altered, sometimes even mutilated, {{versions of the}} opera (see Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith).

25|$|A {{non-binding}} student {{referendum on}} Chief Illiniwek {{was conducted in}} March 2004.

Another non-binding student referendum on Chief Illiniwek was conducted in February 2008.

25|$|Immigrant {{children}} and youths, mostly of lower-class background, are the fastest-growing {{segment of the}} German population. So their prospects bear heavily on {{the well-being of the}} country. More than 30% of Germans aged 15 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. In the big cities, 60% of children aged 5 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. Immigrant children academically underperform their peers. Immigrants <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less educated than native Germans. After controlling for parental education, ethnic group does not play a role in children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Their {{presence}} is controversial, and resisted by {{large segments of}} the Christian population, who argue that the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese Sunnis, however, would be happy to see these Palestinians given the Lebanese nationality, thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of the Sunnis. Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted {{on more than one occasion}} on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{has been}} the object of both {{scholarly}} and popular attention, and its discovery {{was reported in the}} international media. [...] Scholars <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> critical of the literary value of the poem, but consider it valuable as a historical source. [...] Much of the scholarship on the poem has focused on the question of who the speaker and the addressee in the poem are, and whether Charaxos and Larichos are the historical or fictional brothers of Sappho. [...] Others have discussed the place of the Brothers Poem in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, and its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories told in the Odyssey. [...] The lost initial stanza or stanzas of the poem have also been the subject of scholarly attention, with various reconstructions being put forward.|$|E
500|$|On the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two {{principal}} sources, Herodotus' and Simonides' accounts, survive. In fact, Herodotus' {{account of the}} battle, in Book VII of his Histories, is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: [...] "we either write a history of Thermopylae with , or not at all". Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is [...] "almost worse than useless", missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of Diodorus Siculus in his Universal History. Diodorus' account {{seems to have been}} based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus' account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> skeptical.|$|E
500|$|The group's albums <b>have</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both lyrically and musically darker in {{atmosphere}} {{than many of}} their progressive rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were {{the exception rather than}} the rule, preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to stress that the band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as [...] "a male Nico" [...] and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope.|$|E
