25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different <b>from</b> <b>today,</b> which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly {{say that in the}} heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{enclosure}} of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is pierced by nine gates (six opening on the courtyard, two opening on the prayer hall and a ninth allows {{access to the}} maqsura) some of them, such as Bab Al-Ma (Gate of water) located on the western facade, are preceded by salient porches flanked by buttresses and surmounted by ribbed domes based on square tholobate which are porting squinches with three vaults. However, Arab geographers and historians of the Middle Ages Al-Muqaddasi and Al-Bakri reported the existence, around the tenth and eleventh centuries, of about ten gates named differently <b>from</b> <b>today.</b> This reflects the fact that, {{unlike the rest of}} the mosque, {{the enclosure}} has undergone significant changes to ensure the stability of the building (adding many buttresses). Thus, some entries have been sealed, while others were kept.|$|E

25|$|Ann Curry's final show as co-anchor was subdued {{compared}} to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira, as it did not include retrospectives of Curry's 15-year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry's departure <b>from</b> <b>Today</b> began weeks before NBC formally announced that she {{would no longer be}} co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of Jane Pauley and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as since disproven reports suggested that Matt Lauer had a hand in the program's decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer's alleged involvement in Curry's departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing Good Morning America, which toppled Todays 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Associated Press.|$|E

The character was described as a [...] "tasty demon seer" [...] by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and identified as the most memorable incarnation of the Seer by entertainment news website Hypable's Karen Rought. Rought wrote that the role suited Carpenter due to her previous performance as Chase. Charmed Magazines Tara Dilullo agreed and determined that Carpenter was the perfect actress to play Kyra as she [...] "spent the better part of her career facing down the supernatural with a snark and a smile". Carpenter's appearance on Charmed was cited by reader Patrick Kelly, in an article <b>from</b> <b>Today,</b> as an indicator of her popularity among the 16- to 39-year-old male demographic.|$|E

A writer <b>from</b> <b>Today</b> described UPN's enlistment of Eve into a comedy {{as an example of the}} network's attempt to form its own identity through targeting a younger, multi-ethnic audience. In his book TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol, Jake Austen identified Eve as part of a trend in which musicians were prominently featured as the stars of television programs; he cited Brandy's role in Moesha and Queen Latifah on Living Single as two other examples.|$|E

500|$|Set in {{the year}} 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very {{different}} <b>from</b> <b>today.</b> Following a number of environmental disasters, such as [...] "the Withering" [...] {{which resulted in the}} loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the vacuum cleaner and fire (although the latter came back fairly quickly) [...] and a [...] "Cattle-clasm" [...] that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between [...] "Withered Zones" [...] and the remaining inhabitable areas. The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year {{led to the creation of}} new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and drizzly. The Withering resulted in vegetarians, pigeons and gays becoming endangered species, and completely wiped out tarts.|$|E

Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle <b>from</b> <b>Today</b> commented that her dress was [...] "reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks {{at the end of the}} song, he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance". [...] "Oceania" [...] was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08).|$|E
