Guidelines differ as to which <b>dose</b> <b>to</b> use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the <b>dose</b> <b>to</b> reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
25|$|Delivery {{parameters}} of a prescribed dose are determined during treatment planning (part of dosimetry).

Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation <b>dose</b> <b>to</b> the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended <b>dose</b> <b>to</b> the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy.

30|$|The {{biodistribution}} of 124 I-IAZGP {{was characterized}} by rapid clearance from the blood and whole body primarily via the urinary and, to a lesser extent, GI tracts, with no significant uptake in the parenchymal tissues apart from the salivary glands, presumably reflecting dissociated iodine.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the decision to dismiss the four Italian Nuclear Power Plants (NPP), Trino Vercellese NPP will be the first NPP dismantled in Italy. Trino Vercellese decommissioning activities will end by 2013 and will produce in this period a small release of radionuclides in the atmosphere and in the surface waters around the nuclear facility.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies suggest}} that radiation-induced {{injuries}} to the hippocampus play important roles in compromising neurocognitive functioning for patients with brain tumors {{and it could be}} important to spare the hippocampus using modern planning methods for patients with craniopharyngiomas. As bilateral hippocampus are located on the same level as the planning target volume (PTV) in patients with craniopharyngioma, it seems possible <b>to</b> reduce <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> hippocampus using non-coplanar beams. While the use of non-coplanar beams in volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) of malignant intracranial tumors has recently been reported, no dosimetric comparison has yet been made between VMAT using non-coplanar arcs (ncVMAT) and VMAT employing only coplanar arcs (coVMAT) among patients with craniopharyngiomas. We performed a planning study comparing <b>dose</b> distributions <b>to</b> the PTV, hippocampus, and other organs at risk (OAR) of dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), coVMAT, and ncVMAT. Methods: DCAT, coVMAT, and ncVMAT plans were created for 10 patients with craniopharyngiomas. The prescription dose was 52. 2 Gy in 29 fractions, and 99 % of each PTV was covered by 90 % of the prescribed dose. The maximum dose was held below 107 % of the prescribed dose. CoVMAT and ncVMAT plans were formulated to satisfy the following criteria: the <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the hippocampus were minimized, and the <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the OAR were similar to or lower than those of DCAT. Results: The mean equivalent doses in 2 -Gy fractions to 40 % of the volumes of the bilateral hippocampus [EQD 2 (40 %hippos) ] were 15. 4 / 10. 8 / 6. 5 Gy for DCAT/coVMAT/ncVMAT, respectively. The EQD 2 (40 %hippos) for ncVMAT were < 7. 3 Gy, which is the threshold predicting cognitive impairment, as defined by Gondi et al [...] The mean <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> normal brain tissue and the conformity indices were similar for the three plans, and the homogeneity indices were significantly better for coVMAT and ncVMAT compared with DCAT. Conclusions: NcVMAT is more appropriate than DCAT and coVMAT for patients with craniopharyngiomas. NcVMAT significantly reduces radiation <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> the bilateral hippocampus (to 50 % that of the DCAT) without increasing the <b>doses</b> <b>to</b> normal brain tissue and other OAR...|$|R
