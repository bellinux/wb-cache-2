5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod (20 March 1782– 18 November 1835) was an English-born {{officer of}} the British East India Company and an Oriental scholar.

5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography.</b> Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E

5|$|Mt. Kenya was {{discovered}} by Krapf in the next year, on December 3, 1849.

5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography</b> of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E

5|$|On {{her return}} from Haiti, Brown moved to Alabama in 1937 {{and worked at}} the Tuskegee Institute as a history teacher until 1940. In 1940, she joined LeMoyne-Owen College as a history teacher after a move from Alabama to Memphis, Tennessee. She {{continued}} teaching at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1945. Brown faced the same problem as most black educators during that era, in that they were offered appointments to teaching positions in higher education only in historically African American universities and colleges.

5|$|The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Değiştirme İhtisas Komisyonu) {{was created}} under the {{supervision}} of the Ministry of the Interior.

Among the commission's participants were members of the Office of the General Staff, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education, and <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography</b> professors from Ankara University. The initiative proved successful, as approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. This figure also included names of streets, monuments, quarters, neighborhoods, and other components that make up certain municipalities.|$|E

His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography.</b> He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.|$|E

5|$|A {{category}} of historical and geographical literature, focused on regional <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography,</b> {{emerged during the}} 18th century among Greek scholars. This kind of literature combined the collection of ethnographic data with a conviction in geography's moral and religious purpose. Major representatives of this field were two scholars and clerics, Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas. They came {{from the village of}} Milies in Thessaly, modern Greece, and were nicknamed Dimitrieis, from the ancient name of their birthplace (Dimitrias). Both scholars were active members of the Greek diaspora in the Danubian Principalities, in modern Romania, where they studied and taught at the courts of the Greek Orthodox Phanariot and the Princely Academies of Bucharest and Iaşi. This environment offered in general a special attraction for ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to the enlightenment of their nation. Philippidis' and Konstantas' work Geographia Neoteriki, published in Vienna in 1791, belongs to a body of contemporary texts which strove to map out the European parts of the Ottoman Empire and Greece in particular.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt {{was well}} educated; {{along with the}} other {{children}} in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, <b>history,</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography,</b> though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and Émile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut {{off from the rest of}} the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhart's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} clearly in some {{financial}} difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1000 books was {{sold at a}} public auction in Leyden (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue perished in the war but fortunately a manuscript copy {{had been made by}} Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987. Of the titles identified there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography,</b> 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books. The contents of the library provide an insight into Mercator's intellectual studies but the mathematics books are the only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis: they cover arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, architecture, fortification, astronomy, astrology, time measurement, calendar calculation, scientific instruments, cartography and applications. Only one of his own copies has been found—a first edition of Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium annotated in Mercator's hand: this is held by Glasgow University.|$|E

5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, <b>history</b> <b>and</b> <b>geography</b> were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
