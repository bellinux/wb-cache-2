5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

500|$|Then {{she asked}} a final question, {{on what was}} Brahman (world of the imperishable)? Yagnavalakya {{put an end to}} the debate by telling Gargi not to proceed further as other wise she would lose her mental balance. This riposte {{put an end to the}}ir further {{dialogue}} at the conference of the learned. However, at the end of the debate she conceded to the superior knowledge of Yajnavalkya by saying: [...] "venerable Brahmins, you may consider it a great thing <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> off bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was aware}} {{from the outset}} that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> cynical about life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E

500|$|When it was renewed for {{a second}} season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 {{television}} season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob Thomas said that, [...] "I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition." [...] At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On {{the date of the}} airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, [...] "We let Veronica say things that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all day to think about it, would be the perfect retort." ...|$|E
500|$|As for cargo traffic, truckers {{state that}} despite the longer miles, they can make more trips per day at Port Everglades. Also, they blame the port itself for this, not the Downtown traffic. They state that at Port Everglades, they can make three to four runs a day, versus Port of Miami where [...] "you're lucky <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in two," [...] states truck driver Alejandro Arrieta, due to waiting time at the port, which is often several hours. Port Everglades also has major {{redevelopment}} plans underway that includes its own deep dredging to a [...] depth; they also claim to have surpassed the Port of Miami, which {{has long been known}} as the [...] "Cruise Capital of the World" [...] as well as the [...] "Cargo Gateway to the Americas," [...] in both cruise traffic and cargo tonnage handled.|$|E
500|$|Crossing the Sahara was {{considered}} particularly perilous {{at the time}} because of guerilla forces hiding in the mountains. The medicines carried by the truck would have been valuable loot for these groups, {{and for the first}} part of the desert the expedition was accompanied by the French Foreign Legion. The instruction the men received was [...] "No stops, drive for your lives, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a flat tire." [...] The crossing passed without violent incidents, however, and greater problems were presented by the elements. There were no roads in the desert, and the truck was heavily loaded and not especially adapted to the conditions. Several times it got stuck in the desert sand; the crew had to place steel plates underneath for traction and spend hours digging out the sand from under the wheels. This took a great toll on the men, who had a limited supply of water, in temperatures approaching 50°C. The crew spent most nights in oases along the way, but on occasion also slept in sleeping bags in the sand.|$|E

500|$|According to Variety magazine, {{the script}} for Hannibal was: [...] "quite {{faithful}} to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, {{as well as the}} considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake)." [...] Time Out noted: [...] "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E

500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think about it, or understood it, or had seen it.

500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010.

A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the story for you. [...] They {{get to the point}} to kinda show you where to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger.

500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting {{because a lot of the}} film was shot with available light.|$|E
