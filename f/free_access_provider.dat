It is not therefore about <b>free</b> <b>access</b> to law generally, but rather about a particular group of its providers who collaborate. Since the mid- 1990 s the Internet 2 ̆ 7 s World-Wide-Web has provided the necessary technical platform to enable <b>free</b> <b>access</b> to computerised legal information. Prior to the web there were many online legal information systems and numerous legal information products distributed on CD-ROM, {{but there was no}} significant provision of <b>free</b> <b>access</b> to legal information anywhere in the world. Both government and private sector online legal publishers charged for access. The web provided the key element required for <b>free</b> public <b>access</b> - a low cost distribution mechanism. For publishers it was close to a 2 ̆ 7 no cost 2 ̆ 7 distribution mechanism if they were not required to pay for outgoing bandwidth. The ease of use of graphical browsers from around 1994, and the web 2 ̆ 7 s use of hypertext as its principal access mechanism (at that time) meant that the web provided a simple and relatively consistent means by which legal information could be both provided and accessed, an attractive alternative to the proprietary, expensive and training-intensive search engines on which commercial online services largely relied. The development of <b>free</b> <b>access</b> Internet law services was based on these factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The idea of Open Access {{publication}} is {{to provide}} <b>free</b> <b>access</b> to research articles on the Internet. In recent years, many research institutions as well as libraries worldwide started to provide all or parts of their publications following the paradigm of Open <b>Access.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>access,</b> however, bears {{the risk that the}} content may be misused without acknowledging the work of the original authors which should be avoided in any case. Therefore we started the Open Access Plagiarism Search (OAPS) project that exclusively uses OA documents for plagiarism checks. By offering this service free of charge to OA data providers, our project supports the OA community {{and at the same time}} acts as an incentive for closed <b>access</b> <b>providers.</b> In this work, we present the aims of OAPS and show how this project can help to ensure the integrity of OA publications.

40|$|Abstract—The network market shows a {{hierarchy}} of providers, with backbone <b>providers</b> and <b>access</b> <b>providers.</b> We aim in this paper at describing the economic relationships between those network providers, where content providers are associated to backbone <b>providers</b> while <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> compete to attract end users. We study those interactions thanks to game theory, using a multi-level game model. We analyze in addition the vertically integrated case, i. e., the situation when the backbone provider is also an <b>access</b> <b>provider.</b> We then discuss {{the impact of this}} analysis on the network neutrality debate, highlighting the importance of a regulation on prices charged by backbone to <b>access</b> <b>providers.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Part 5 : Cooperation and CollaborationInternational audienceWe study {{competition}} between users over {{access to content}} in a telecom market that includes several <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> and several content providers. We focus situations where exclusive agreements exist between content and <b>access</b> <b>providers,</b> which allows <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> to offer content services for free for their subscribers. We call <b>access</b> <b>providers</b> having such agreements ”super” providers or ”enhanced” service providers. We show that the {{competition between}} the users results in a paradoxical phenomenon in which subscribers of enhanced providers prefer to defer part of their demand to other content providers whose content is costly. We show how this phenomena can be exploited by the content providers so as to maximize their benefits...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} useful {{design for a}} <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat which {{supports}} two frequency bands of 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz. The <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat is a sheet-shaped waveguide which consists of a tightly coupled double-layered microstrip resonator array. It provides easy access for devices in short-range wireless communications. Interference is a common problem with conventional applications which use free space transmission. Our proposed wireless access system uses a subsidiary waveguide, the <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat. Wireless devices are proximately coupled to the <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat through which the coupled electromagnetic (EM) wave transmits. The arrival domain of the EM wave of an application is therefore limited to an area close to the <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat. Wireless devices can be coupled to the <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat at an arbitrary position without contact. We previously presented a <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat for a single frequency band. This paper presents a <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat for the two frequency bands of 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz. The <b>free</b> <b>access</b> mat uses a ring patch resonator array which is easily excited by typical antennas and is resistant to interference. These characteristics are demonstrated by numerical simulation and confirmed by experiment...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} product {{differentiation}} decision of a downstream entrant that purchases {{access to a}} bottleneck input from one of two vertically integrated incumbents, who will compete {{with him in the}} downstream market. First, an entrant chooses his product, then the entrant negotiates the access price with two incumbents, and finally the firms compete on retail prices. Counter-intuitively, both the entrant and the <b>access</b> <b>provider</b> prefer that the entrant chooses a product that is a closer substitute of the product of the <b>access</b> <b>provider</b> than of the product of the other incumbent. This occurs because the <b>access</b> <b>provider</b> interacts with the entrant both in the retail market and the wholesale market. We also consider the cases where both parties make the access price offers and where the bargaining stage precedes the location stage. Horizontal differentiation Location Access price...|$|R

40|$|Today’s location-sensitive service {{relies on}} user’s mobile device to {{determine}} its location and send the location to the application. A location-based service is a service that determines {{the location of a}} mobile device and uses this to provide functionalities and information specific to that location. With the growth of the importance and of the audience of location-based services, questions of security and privacy are brought forward. As services are being built on top of this technology, the number of parties increases significantly, and the possibility of a malicious insider (or a misbehaving insider) emerges. The extent to which the parties care to trust each other has reduced, and trust amongst the various parties can no longer be assumed by a location-based service. An attacker may try to steal a service (e. g., claiming to be a client to get <b>free</b> internet <b>access),</b> service <b>providers</b> may gain of private information. There should be a proper authentication mechanism between client and server to access the services. By considering some important factors like Cost, Energy Efficiency, we have proposed an Access Mechanism in which mobile Phone Users will send request for some services from server. Firstly Location Verification is done; server verifies the User’s Mobile Phone’s location against authorized location. After User/Device Authentication is done, server checks User/Device Identification. If both conditions are true, server will grant access to the users for services and resources...|$|R
