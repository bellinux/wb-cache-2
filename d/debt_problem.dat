Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing <b>debt</b> <b>problem</b> and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example {{for the rest of the}} populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World <b>debt</b> <b>problem,</b> arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{increase}} the understanding and awareness of what the pathways into and out of <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> can look like, why people get into bad <b>debt</b> situations, how <b>problems</b> are handled and how they are perceived. The empirical data is based on semi-structured narrative interviews with 32 people who can relate to a debt settlement in three ways, either by just having applied for a debt settlement, finding themselves {{in the midst of a}} debt settlement or being debt-free since a few years back. The material is analyzed in terms relating to the processes, strategies and impact factors surrounding <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> and <b>debt</b> settlements. <b>Debt</b> <b>problems</b> can either happen slowly and gradually or arise suddenly and unexpectedly. The causes may be an interaction between individual and structural factors. Both coping strategies and influencing factors can change over time and depend on where in the debt process one is. The results show that the coping strategies vary from active to passive, from open to closed, where the determining factors are mainly how one was treated/ received, one's health, age, sense of shame and guilt, social relationships, as well as the causes of debt.   The results show how there is interplay between individual and structural factors in terms of causes, but also in the strategies and approaches expressed. The coping strategies are influenced and changed with the time scale over the debt process. Women have a risk to a greater extent than men to suffer from <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> without having spent any money, but instead by acting as co-signer or guarantor. The conclusion is that <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> do not just affect a certain group of individuals, but that anyone can in principle be affected by excessive debt. What becomes clear is that there is not only one but several ways into and out of <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> in which both individual and structural factors are important. Although there is a way out of excessive <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> through <b>debt</b> relief law, results show that the solution extends over time and has far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society...|$|R

Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the <b>debt</b> <b>problem.</b> Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the <b>debt</b> <b>problem.</b> By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E

The revolutionaries, headed by former president Manuel Bonilla, and the government agreed to a cease-fire and the installation of a provisional president who would be selected by the United States mediator, Thomas Dawson. Dawson selected Francisco Bertrand, who promised to hold early, free elections, and Dávila resigned. The 1912 elections were won by Manuel Bonilla, but he died after just over a year in office. Bertrand, who had been his vice president, returned to the presidency and in 1916 won election for a term that lasted until 1920.|$|E

After the FairTax was in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. On the other hand, the FairTax includes a 23% inclusive transitional inventory tax credit on the cost of the inventory to be applied in the month that it is sold.

25|$|Even {{before the}} nullification issue had been settled, another {{controversy}} arose to challenge Jackson's leadership. It concerned the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. The First Bank of the United States {{had been established}} in 1791, under Alexander Hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20-year period. After the Revolutionary War, the United States had a large war debt to France and others, and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray, as state banks printed their own currency, and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult. Hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the <b>debt</b> <b>problem</b> and to unify the nation under one currency. While it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade, it was resented by Westerners and workers who {{believed that it was}} granting special favors to a few powerful men.

A BIS study released in June 2012 warns that budgets of most advanced economies, excluding interest payments, [...] "would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2 per cent of gross domestic product—starting now—just to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its pre-crisis level".

40|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people in}} the UK experiencing <b>problems</b> repaying <b>debt</b> has increased in recent years. A growing body of evidence suggests {{that there may be a}} relationship between <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> and clinically significant psychological distress. However, the causal direction of this relationship is unclear. Furthermore, it seems likely that psychological factors influence the relationship, such that how people make sense of their financial situation determines, at least in part, the extent to which they experience distress. The present study aims to develop a richer understanding of the relationship between debt and psychological distress from the perspective of those experiencing both difficulties. The study was part of the Debt Counselling for Depression in Primary Care trial (DeCoDer). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight adults recruited through GP practices in Liverpool. All identified as having <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> and significant depressive symptoms. A thematic analysis was undertaken from a social materialist perspective, focusing on how participants’ experience of <b>debt</b> <b>problems</b> impacted on their lives. Two over-arching themes were identified, each consisting of three sub-themes. Living with debt day-to-day described experiences of constant worry, material hardship and feelings of shame. Cumulative psychological impacts described the longer-term consequences of <b>debt</b> <b>problems,</b> highlighting in particular how debt threatened participants’ sense of themselves as valuable and led to a perceived loss of agency in the face of difficulties. Results of the analysis are discussed in light of psychological research and recent arguments from anthropology and political philosophy. The findings suggest that psychological processes of rumination, social comparison and identity threat may be significant factors in causing distress amongst people with <b>debt</b> <b>problems,</b> in part because of a wider social milieu in which not being able to pay one’s debts is seen as a moral failing. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The first budget {{introduced}} by Martin in February 1994, {{who had become}} the Finance Minister in November 1993 {{was described as a}} [...] "mild and tame" [...] budget focused only on the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, and brought in modest cuts, mostly to defence spending. Until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Chrétien government tended to be hostile towards defence spending with the government's white paper [...] "Defence 94" [...] declaring that in a post-Cold War world there would be less and less need for armed forces, which accordingly meant reduced budgets for the military. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein in his 2004 book Who Killed the Canadian Military? accused the Chrétien government of putting the military in the uncomfortable position in the 1990s of having to do more and more UN peacekeeping missions while cutting defence spending at the same time. Granatstein accused Chrétien of having [...] "finished off the Canadian Forces" [...] through a policy of heavy cuts inspired by a deep personal dislike of the military and of using the military as UN peacekeepers rather preparing to fight a war. Outside of defence spending, there were few cuts in the 1994 budget. In a radio interview with Ron Collister in March 1994, Chrétien stated: [...] "To go to our goal of 3 per cent of GNP, all the cuts been announced in the budget. There will not be a new round." [...] According to the diplomat James Bartleman, Chrétien told him in early 1994 that major cuts to government spending outside of defence were out of the question, and instead he hoped that economy would grow enough on its own that the deficit would disappear without any cuts. Chrétien's plans in early 1994 for economic growth were to increase exports by embracing globalization and free trade with as many nations as possible, arguing that the export offensive would stimulate the economy out of the early 1990s recession. The 1994 budget was widely criticised by journalists such as Andrew Coyne as useless in even achieving its target of reducing deficit to 3% of GNP within three years, let alone eliminating the deficit, and led to a celebrated clash between Coyne and Martin in the boardroom of the Globe and Mail newspaper. Investor reaction to the 1994 budget was very negative with many concluding that the Liberals had no serious interest in dealing with the <b>debt</b> <b>problem</b> with one economist recalling that after the 1994 budget the consensus amongst economists was that [...] "They don’t get it. They just don’t get it". David A. Dodge, the Deputy Finance Minister complained repeatedly to Martin throughout 1994 that the 3% target was meaningless as Canada did not plan to join the European Union, that it was unlikely to be achieved with the current levels of cuts outlined in the 1994 budget, and would even if achieved would do nothing to help the economy. Accordingly, Dodge advocated far more drastic cuts, policy advice that both Martin ignored until late 1994 and Chrétien until early 1995. Dodge had appointed deputy finance minister by Mulroney in 1992, and thus his views were something to the right of both Martin and Chrétien. In April 1994, interest rates in Canada started a steady rise that would continue until early 1995.|$|E
