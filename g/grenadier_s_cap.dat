40|$|In 26 S proteasomes, '' 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> complexes'' {{associate}} with either {{one or both}} ends of the barrel-shaped 20 S core complex. These regulatory complexes which comprise about 20 different subunits, including 6 ATPases of the AAA family, are thought to recognize ubiquitinated substrate proteins, to dissociate and unfold them before threading them into the 20 S core where they are degraded. Here, we examine the structure of 26 S proteasomes from Drosophila embryos and Xenopus oocytes by electron microscopy. Image analysis reveals a rather flexible linkage between the 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> and the 20 S core, with a peculiar wagging-type movement of the caps relative to the core. At this stage of the analysis, {{it is not clear whether}} this movement is relevant in terms of function. Three-dimensional reconstructions, taking this into account, provide first insights into the remarkably complex structure of the 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> and allows us to put forward a composite model of the entire 26 S complex.

40|$|AbstractThe final {{destination}} {{of the majority}} of proteins that have to be selectively degraded in eukaryotic cells is the proteasome, a highly sophisticated nanomachine essential for life. 26 S proteasomes select target proteins via their modification with polyubiquitin chains or, in rare cases, by the recognition of specific motifs. They are made up of different subcomplexes, a 20 S core proteasome harboring the proteolytic active sites hidden within its barrel-like structure and two 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> that execute regulatory functions. Similar complexes equipped with PA 28 regulators instead of 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> are a variation of this theme specialized for the production of antigenic peptides required in immune response. Structure analysis as well as extensive biochemical and genetic studies of the 26 S proteasome and the ubiquitin system led to a basic model of substrate recognition and degradation. Recent work raised new concepts. Additional factors involved in substrate acquisition and delivery to the proteasome have been discovered. Moreover, first insights in the tasks of individual subunits or subcomplexes of the 19 <b>S</b> <b>caps</b> in substrate recognition and binding as well as release and recycling of polyubiquitin tags have been obtained...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitin-dependent {{proteolysis}} is catalyzed by the 26 S proteasome, {{a dynamic}} complex of 32 different proteins whose mode of assembly and {{mechanism of action}} are poorly understood, {{in part due to}} the difficulties encountered in purifying the intact complex. Here we describe a one-step affinity method for purifying intact 26 S proteasomes, 19 <b>S</b> regulatory <b>caps,</b> and 20 <b>S</b> core particles from budding yeast cells. Affinity-purified 26 S proteasomes hydrolyze both model peptides and the ubiquitinated Cdk inhibitor Sic 1. Affinity purifications performed in the absence of ATP or presence of the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATP-gamma -S unexpectedly revealed {{that a large number of}} proteins, including subunits of the skp 1 -cullin-F-box protein ligase (SCF) and anaphase-promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligases, copurify with the 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap.</b> To identify these proteasome-interacting proteins, we used a recently developed method that enables the direct analysis of the composition of large protein complexes (DALPC) by mass spectrometry. Using DALPC, we identified more than 24 putative proteasome-interacting proteins, including Ylr 421 c (Daq 1), which we demonstrate to be a new subunit of the budding yeast 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap,</b> and Ygr 232 w (Nas 6), which is homologous to a subunit of the mammalian 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> (PA 700 complex). Additional PIPs include the heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp 82, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp 6, and proteins involved in transcriptional control, mitosis, tubulin assembly, RNA metabolism, and signal transduction. Our data demonstrate that nucleotide hydrolysis modulates the association of many proteins with the 26 S proteasome, and validate DALPC as a powerful tool for rapidly identifying stoichiometric and substoichiometric components of large protein assemblies...|$|R

CAP is a bifunctional protein; the N-terminal domain appears to be involved in cellular responsiveness to RAS, whereas loss of the C-terminal portion is associated with morphological and nutritional defects. <b>S.</b> pombe <b>cap</b> can suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of the C-terminal <b>CAP</b> domain in <b>S.</b> cerevisiae but does not suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of the N-terminal domain.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ubiquitin}} proteasome system classically selects its substrates for degradation by tagging {{them with}} ubiquitin. Here, we describe another means of controlling proteasome {{function in a}} global manner. The 26 S proteasome can be inhibited by modification with the enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This reversible modification of the proteasome inhibits the proteolysis of the transcription factor Sp 1 and a hydrophobic peptide through inhibition of the ATPase activity of 26 S proteasomes. The Rpt 2 ATPase in the mammalian proteasome 19 <b>S</b> <b>cap</b> is modified by O-GlcNAc in vitro and in vivo and as its modification increases, proteasome function decreases. This mechanism may couple proteasomes to the general metabolic state of the cell.

40|$|Proteasome {{activator}} PA 200 enhances proteasome-mediated cleavage after acidic residues in vitro; however, {{its role}} within cells is not known.

Unlike many other proteins that respond to DNA damage, the response of PA 200 appears to be independent of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated and p 53, but dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase activity. Nonetheless, PA 200 is critical because PA 200 -knockdown cells show genomic instability and reduced survival after exposure to ionizing radiation. This phenotype is reproduced by specific inhibition of postglutamyl activity of proteasomes, but combined treatment with PA 200 siRNA and postglutamyl inhibitor does not show additive effects on survival. Together, these data suggest a unique role for PA 200 in genomic stability that is likely mediated through its ability to enhance postglutamyl cleavage by proteasomes...|$|R
