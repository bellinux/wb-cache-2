Some studies have indicated that full publication is associated with the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> (publication bias). No study has looked into the occurrence of publication bias in the field of addiction. Objectives To investigate whether the significance or <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> of abstracts presented at the major international scientific conference on addiction is associated with full publication Methods The conference proceedings of the US Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD), were handsearched for abstracts of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that evaluated interventions for prevention, rehabilitation and treatment of drug addiction in humans (years searched 1993 – 2002). Data regarding the study designs and outcomes reported were extracted. Subsequent publication in peer reviewed journals was searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, as of March 2006. Results Out of 5919 abstracts presented, 581 met the inclusion criteria; 359 (62 %) conference abstracts had been published in a broad variety of peer reviewed journals (average time of publication 2. 6 years, SD +/- 1. 78). The proportion of published studies was almost the same for randomized controlled trials (62. 4 %) and controlled clinical trials (59. 5 %) while studies that reported positive results {{were significantly more likely to}} be published (74. 5 %) than those that did not report statistical results (60. 9 %.), negative or null results (47. 1 %) and no results (38. 6 %), Abstracts reporting positive results had a significantly higher probability of being published in full, while abstracts reporting null or negative results were half as likely to be published compared with positive ones (HR = 0. 48; 95 %CI 0. 30 – 0. 74) Conclusion Clinical trials were the minority of abstracts presented at the CPDD; we found evidence of possible publication bias in the field of addiction, with negative or null results having half the likelihood of being published than positive ones. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: During peer review, {{submitted}} manuscripts are scrutinised {{by independent}} experts to assist journal editors in their decision-making {{and to help}} {{improve the quality of}} articles. In this retrospective cohort study, peer review comments for drug trials submitted to medical journals were analysed to investigate whether there is a relation between the content of these comments and sponsorship, <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> and decision about acceptance. DESIGN/SETTING: Descriptive content analysis of reviewer comments made on manuscripts on drug trials submitted to eight medical journals (January 2010 -April 2012). For each manuscript, the number of reviewers, decision about acceptance, sponsorship and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> were extracted. Reviewer comments were classified using a predefined checklist. RESULTS: Reviewer reports for 246 manuscripts were assessed. Industry-sponsored trials were more likely to receive comments about lack of novelty (8. 9 %) than industry-supported (2. 5 %) and non-industry trials (6. 1 %, overall p= 0. 038). Non-industry trials more often received comments about poor experimental design (69. 7 %) than industry-supported (58. 8 %) and industry-sponsored trials (52. 9 %, overall p= 0. 019). Non-industry trials {{were also more likely to}} receive comments regarding inappropriate statistical analyses (28. 4 %) than industry-supported (23. 5 %) and industry-sponsored trials (15. 1 %, overall p= 0. 006). Manuscripts with negative results were more likely to receive comments about inappropriate conclusions (29. 3 %) than those with positive results (18. 9 %, p= 0. 010). Rejected manuscripts had more often received comments on the research question not being clinically relevant (7. 8 %) than accepted manuscripts (1. 6 %, p= 0. 002), and also on lack of novelty (8. 3 % vs 2. 6 %, p= 0. 008) and poor experimental design (68. 6 % vs 50. 5 %, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Reviewers identified fewer shortcomings regarding design and statistical analyses in industry-related trials, but commented more often on a lack of novelty in industry-sponsored trials. Negative trial results did not significantly influence the nature of comments other than appropriateness of the conclusion. Manuscript acceptance was primarily related to the research question and methodological robustness of studies...|$|E

Perception depends on the exploratory movements as well as influencing them. While {{this seems to be}} common sense, scientifically we know very little about the temporal dynamics during haptic exploration. To address this, we investigated the exploratory force modulations of two groups of healthy young adults during the exploration of grated surfaces with differing detection difficulty during successive (n = 20) and random stimulus presentation (n = 20). Results showed that exploratory force depended on stimulus properties and increased with increasing detection difficulty. Both experiments yielded the same <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> with slightly smaller effects in the random stimulus presentation group. Across exploration time average fingertip force also increased. The biggest increase occurred systematically at the beginning (within the first 40 percent) of exploration time per stimulus indicating that most critical information is received during the initial contact phase and is directly transformed into the exploration procedure and force application. Furthermore, video-analyses and comparisons to our high temporal resolution data revealed strong dynamic changes in pressure application during test stimulus exploration with differences in the force dynamics and exploration strategies of simple and difficult stimuli...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess oral {{presentation}} bias at a national level. This was a retrospective cohort study with initial characteristics of the approved protocols extracted from the committee's archives, and follow‐up characteristics obtained from a questionnaire mailed to the principal investigators. A representative sample of French research ethics committees (25 / 48), the only committees legally endorsed for ethical authorisation in biomedical research, were studied. All completed research protocols, which had been approved in 1994 by these committees, were included. Initial characteristics (design, study size, investigator) of completed studies and follow‐up information (<b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> rates of publication and rates of oral presentation) were collected. Complete information on results and their dissemination was available for 248 completed non‐confidential protocols. Half of these (49 %) were declared as orally presented. The observed ranking for strategies to disseminate results was the following: orally presented and published, published only, neither orally presented nor published and orally presented only. Confirmatory results were more often orally presented, with an adjusted OR of 6. 4 (95 % CI 2. 69 to 15. 22). Other associated variables are the following: national/international scope of the study, protocol writer's university status, adverse events and interim analysis. There is a trend to submit or accept confirmatory results for oral presentations: meetings are a biased representation of research, and oral presentation bias could even be higher than publication bias...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: A {{potentially}} useful role for instrumental variable (IV) analysis {{may be as}} a complementary analysis to assess the presence of confounding when studying adverse drug effects. There has been discussion on whether the observed increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for third-generation oral contraceptives versus second-generation oral contraceptives could be (partially) attributed to confounding. We investigated how prescribing preference IV estimates compare with conventional estimates. METHODS: Women in the Clinical Practice Research Database who started a second-generation or third-generation oral contraceptive from 1989 to 2013 were included. Ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares regression were used to estimate risk differences in VTE. Cox regression and IV for Cox proportional hazards regression were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR). The instrument used was the proportion of prescriptions for third-generation oral contraceptives by the general practitioner in the year preceding the current prescription. RESULTS: All analyses pointed {{in the direction of}} an increased VTE risk for third-generation oral contraceptives. The adjusted HR from the conventional Cox regression was 1. 62 (95 % confidence interval 1. 16 - 2. 27) and the fully adjusted HR from the IV Cox regression was 3. 45 (95 % confidence interval; 0. 97 - 11. 7), showing a larger risk and wider confidence intervals in the IV analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity in <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> from the IV analyses and conventional analyses suggests that major confounding is unlikely. IV analysis can be a useful complementary analysis to assess the presence of confounding in studies of adverse drug effects in very large databases. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{issue of}} {{reporting}} {{conflicts of interest}} (COI) in medical research has come under scrutiny over the past decade. Absolute transparency is important when dealing with conflicts of interest to provide readers with all essential information required to make an informative decision of the results. The key objective {{of this study was}} to examine the prevalence of reporting conflicts of interest in therapeutic dental meta-analyses of Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), and to investigate possible associations with other categorical variables. Study Design: We conducted an extensive literature search across multiple databases to search for relevant review articles for this study. We utilized pre-determined key words, and relied on three reviewers to test and review the use of a data extraction form that was used for the meta-analyses. Data regarding study characteristics, <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> and the significance of the results from each meta-analysis were extracted. Results: There were 129 meta-analyses used in this review, and the reporting on conflict of interest was low with only 50 (38. 8 %) of the articles possessing a conflict of interest statement (either confirming of denying COI). Of these 50 articles, there were only 4 (8 %) studies that reported an actual conflict of interest. A statement of conflicts of interest was found in 29 (35. 3 %) of the papers that reported significant findings, whereas 35 % of the papers that reported positive results reported on conflict of interest. Prior to 2009, only 17 (25 %) papers reported conflicts of interest, but since 2009, 54. 1 % of papers collected had a conflict of interest statement. Conclusions: Meta-analyses published in the field of dentistry do not routinely report author conflicts of interest. Although few conflicts appear to exist, the field of dentistry should continue to ensure that best evidence reports provide clear and transparent reporting of potential conflicts of interest in academic journals...|$|E
40|$|Background: Not all {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) respond to levodopa and others develop dyskinesias. Ropinirole, a dopamine agonist, {{is associated with}} fewer dyskinesias than levodopa. Objective: To examine {{the economic impact of}} reducing dyskinesias using ropinirole instead of levodopa plus benserazide in PD was examined. The research question addressed was: is the added cost of ropinirole offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia? Methods: A cost-minimisation analysis was performed from both the societal and Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ontario, Canada perspectives, using 5 -year data from a study of dyskinesia outcomes comparing ropinirole with levodopa plus benserazide. A predictive model was developed to capture resource utilisation over 5 years, such as medication costs, medical consultations, hospital admissions, nursing home admissions, caregiver time and productivity loss. The model was based on a previously reported clinical trial which determined dyskinesia rates to be 20 % for ropinirole and 45 % for levodopa. Standard costing lists were used, and costs were discounted at various rates. Constant 1999 Canadian dollars ($Can) were applied, and no increases were assumed over the time horizon of the analysis. A multivariate sensitivity analysis with changes in key parameters was also performed. Results: From a societal perspective, ropinirole was cost saving. From the MoH perspective, the analysis yielded an incremental expected daily cost/patient of $Can 4. 41 for substituting levodopa plus benserazide with ropinirole. Ropinirole resulted in daily savings/patient of $Can 0. 17 in non-drug healthcare costs. In the sensitivity analysis, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> did not change despite changes of 15 to 20 % in key parameters, suggesting robustness of the model. Conclusions: From the societal perspective, in comparison with levodopa plus benserazide, the added cost of ropinirole is offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia.

At one year, there were no differences in mortality among devices. Resolute and Endeavor zotarolimus-ES, everolimus-ES, and sirolimus-ES, but not biodegradable polymer biolimus-ES, were associated with significantly reduced odds of myocardial infarction (by 29 - 34 %) compared with paclitaxel-ES. Compared with everolimus-ES, biodegradable polymer biolimus-ES were associated with significantly increased odds of myocardial infarction (by 29 %), while Endeavor zotarolimus-ES and paclitaxel-ES were associated with significantly increased odds of stent thrombosis.
