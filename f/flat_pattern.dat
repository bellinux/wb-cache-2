25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on <b>flat</b> <b>pattern,</b> geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated enough to do justice to the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E

And it must have taken some doing. The whole of the skinned kid was there, the head curled in against a shoulder, the stubby cut ears, the eyes, the teeth, the few hairs of the nostrils: and the feet curled curiously round, like an animal that puts its fore-paw over its ducked head: and the hind-legs twisted indescribably up: and all {{skewered}} flat-wise upon the long iron rod, so that it was a complete <b>flat</b> <b>pattern.</b> It reminded me intensely of those distorted, slim-limbed, dog-like animals which figure on the old Lombard ornaments, distorted and curiously infolded upon themselves.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of packaging products can be represented as folded structures. This contribution demonstrates an approach for generating a set of feasible <b>flat</b> <b>patterns</b> based upon a graph representation of the folded structures. It presents algorithms to detect several typical design features. In order to present alternative <b>flat</b> <b>patterns</b> with different properties to the designer, it is preferred to first generate all feasible spanning trees. Two options to decrease the number of generated spanning trees are then proposed: user constraints and overlapping features. Each of these reduction possibilities is examined, and several practical examples with outcomes are shown. The presented framework shows a decrease of up to 98. 5 % {{in the number of}} possible <b>flat</b> <b>patterns</b> for the investigated parts. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Bend {{allowance}} {{and bend}} deduction are quantities {{used to determine}} the flat length of sheet stock to give the desired dimension of the bent part. Both bend deduction and bend allowance represent the difference between the neutral line or unbent <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> (the required length of the material prior to bending) and the formed bend. Subtracting them from the combined length of both flanges gives the <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> length. The question of which formula to use is determined by the dimensioning method used to define the flanges as shown in the two diagrams below.|$|E
50|$|The bend {{allowance}} (BA) is {{the length of}} the arc of the neutral line between the tangent points of a bend in any material. Adding the length of each flange taken between the center of the radius to the BA gives the <b>Flat</b> <b>Pattern</b> length.

40|$|Most of {{the modern}} CAD systems have {{capabilities}} to work with sheet metal parts. However, the functionality of these modules is limited to modelling, unfolding and delivering project documentation. In some cases the proposed design cannot be manufactured without splitting one or more faces of the part. In the current work, the graph representation of sheet metal parts and corresponding <b>flat</b> <b>patterns</b> are discussed. A splitting procedure is introduced which keeps all existing connections between faces intact. In addition, three interpretations for splitting are presented and recommendations for possible usage are given. The splitting procedure {{is found to be}} a convenient option to create feasible <b>flat</b> <b>patterns.</b> In addition, the different splitting interpretations present more flexibility to the designer. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Owen Jones (15 February 1809 – 19 April 1874) was an English-born Welsh architect.

50|$|An {{easy way}} to rotate a dart on a <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> is to slice a {{straight}} line from the dart point to another edge of the pattern (the slash). The two pieces thus created can then be pivoted (spread) at the dart point to shift the dart to the position of the slash.|$|E
50|$|A dart in a <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> has two {{important}} properties: its point, {{the point in}} the pattern at which the dart aims or converges, and the intake, or the amount of fabric taken in or removed. Since the dart can extend toward any edge of the pattern without affecting fit, the length of the dart intake {{at the edge of the}} fabric is not a good measure of dart intake. Rather, the angle subtracted from the pattern by the dart is what determines the dart's intake.|$|E
50|$|Inverse One-step methods {{compute the}} {{deformation}} {{potential of a}} finished part geometry to the flattened blank. Mesh initially with the shape and material characteristics of the finished geometry is deformed to the <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> blank. The strain computed in this inverse forming operation is then inverted to predict the deformation potential of the flat blank being deformed into the final part shape. All the deformation is assumed to happen in one increment or step and is the inverse of the process which the simulation is meant to represent, thus the name Inverse One-Step.|$|E

40|$|ETFE cushion {{structure}} {{has been widely}} used as building roof and façade in lots kinds of civil buildings due to its advantages that mainly include transparent, lightweight, durability. There are mainly two design methods to determine the form of ETFE cushion. According to the model used for the analysis process of cutting, the two forming design methods consist of three-dimensional pattering method and <b>flat</b> <b>patterning</b> method. To investigate the forming design methods of ETFE cushion, two methods are presented which are the three-dimensional patterning method based on the zero-stress state and the <b>flat</b> <b>patterning</b> method based on nonlinearity of ETFE material. The physical states and mechanical models are defined for the two methods, respectively. On {{the basis of the}} theoretical analysis, experiments and numerical simulations on the two separate ETFE cushions are performed to obtain the shapes, stress distributions and the variations. It is found that, for the three-dimensional patterning model, the maximum difference of the shapes between experimental and numerical results is only 4 mm and the difference of the stress distributions is only 0. 4 MPa. For the <b>flat</b> <b>patterning</b> model, a good agreement between the experimental and numerical results is obtained for the initial shape, and it is obtained that the stress decreases when the shape height and the ratio of rise to span increase due to the creep properties of ETFE materials. These findings have validated the proposed forming design methods, which are great importance for the application and development of ETFE cushion...|$|R
50|$|Other open {{surfaces}} and surfaces closed in one direction, and all surfaces closed in both directions, can't be flattened without deformation. A hemisphere or sphere, for example, can't. Such surfaces are curved in both directions. This is why {{maps of the}} Earth are distorted. The larger the area the map represents, the greater the distortion. Sheet metal surfaces which lack a <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> must be manufactured by stamping using 3D dies (sometimes requiring multiple dies with different draw depths and/or draw directions), {{which tend to be}} more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Research into {{control of}} {{spending}} habits across the cycle observed {{a significant degree}} of variability with regard to bidding behaviour across the menstrual cycle within both pill users as well as naturally cycling non-pill users. One study examined self-control of spending across the cycle with regard to bidding behaviours. It was found that when a woman experiences a natural cycle bids are significantly more, than the bids of men, across the whole cycle except for the ovulatory phase. The research has produced mixed results with non-pill users demonstrating a <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> of bidding behaviours across the menstrual cycle.|$|E
50|$|External mix nozzles {{contacts}} fluids {{outside the}} nozzle {{as shown in}} the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more atomizing air and a higher atomizing air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the atomizing air nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns. A <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> is formed with additional air ports to flatten or reshape the circular spray cross-section discharge.|$|E

5000|$|The third {{movement}} (presto) {{begins with}} the three notes of the C minor triad in a C-G-C-E <b>flat</b> <b>pattern.</b> This upwards moving passage then moves down from E flat to C then repeats the opening pattern with different notes, D-G-D-F and then descends from F to D and then returns to E flat. In order to complete this opening passage there is a downwards scale from E- flat to C and then leave the opening {{in a state of}} resolution, there is a final four note pattern, B natural-C-D and finally to G, the dominant. This is then repeated an octave lower. Throughout this, the left hand is playing short, staccato accompanying quarter notes whereas the right, which was discussed above, is playing eighth note tuplet. After the opening passage is complete, there is the a series of broken C major chords one octave above from where the opening passage ended. Each of these broken chords are repeated twice, modulating from C major to F minor to B flat major and finally, to E flat major. Once reaching E flat major, the relative major of C minor, there is a downwards scale continuing until reaching G, an octave lower. From this point, a new pattern emerges, consisting of the three notes: F, G, A flat and B flat. The notes are arranged in a G-A flat-B flat F-G-A <b>flat</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is repeated twice. After this pattern, a broken E flat major tonic chord is played, followed by another downwards scale once again beginning on C and continuing to a low F. Following the scale is a final closing pattern, one which is not heard in again in the piece. The closing bar ends with a broken E flat major chord beginning on G followed by the three notes C - A flat - G and closes in a E flat major cadence. (End of first part.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The flat-pattern {{method is}} where the entire pattern is drafted {{on a flat surface}} from measurements, using rulers, curves and straight-edges. A pattern maker would also use various tools such as a notcher, drill and awl to mark the pattern. Usually, flat {{patterning}} begins with the creation of a sloper or block pattern, a simple, fitted garment made to the wearer's measurements. For women, this will usually be a jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, and for men an upper sloper and a pants sloper. The final sloper pattern is usually made of cardboard or paperboard, without seam allowances or style details (thicker paper or cardboard allows repeated tracing and pattern development from the original sloper). Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called toiles (UK) or muslins (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on. The <b>flat</b> <b>pattern</b> drafting method is the most commonly used method in menswear; menswear rarely involves draping. There are many pattern making system available, but M.

At the same time the background evokes the conflict between two- and three-dimensionality intrinsic to the work of Degas and other modernists. Paintings such as The Kiss were visual manifestations of fin-de-siecle spirit because they capture a decadence conveyed by opulent and sensuous images. The use of gold leaf recalls medieval [...] "gold-ground" [...] paintings and illuminated manuscripts, and earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art and the decorative tendrils seen in Western art since before classical times. The man's head ends very close to the top of the canvas, a departure from traditional Western canons that reflects the influence of Japanese prints, as does the very simplified composition. The two figures are situated at the edge of a patch of flowery meadow. The man wears a robe with black and white rectangles irregularly placed on gold leaf decorated with spirals. He wears a crown of vines while the woman is shown in a tight-fitting dress with flower-like round or oval motifs on a background of parallel wavy lines. Her hair is sprinkled with flowers and is worn in a fashionable upsweep; it forms a halo-like circle that highlights her face, and is continued under her chin by what seems to be a necklace of flowers. Similarly juxtaposed couples appear in both Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze and Stoclet Frieze.|$|E
