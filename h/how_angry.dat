500|$|Stunned {{at their}} father's newly {{revealed}} hatred, Meg, Chris and Stewie avoid Peter. After realizing <b>how</b> <b>angry</b> they are, Peter tries to reconcile {{with his kids}} by spending time with each of them. However, he and his kids share no common interests and Peter only makes things worse by using the methamphetamine {{he had wanted to}} share with Chris. After a heartfelt speech does not work, Peter finally buys his kids' love by giving them a new Xbox 360, and they proclaim Peter [...] "the best father ever". At the end of the show, Peter plays , albeit terribly, much to the other players' fury, two of them being Quagmire and Joe who tell Peter he sucks at the game.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you <b>how</b> <b>angry</b> that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, you can draw a straight line from those shenanigans to the stuff that was being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet." [...] Stewart said of Cramer in particular, [...] "I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge that you have of the intricacies of the market with the crazy bullshit I see you do every night." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the grand}} jury {{evidence}} pointed to a possible motive for Brawley's falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, later shooting and killing her. There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a shoplifting charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. Witnesses also described King as having talked about his stepdaughter in a sexualized manner. On the day of her alleged disappearance, Brawley had skipped school to visit her boyfriend, Todd Buxton, who was serving a six-month jail sentence. When Buxton's mother (with whom she had visited Buxton in jail) urged her to get home before she got in trouble, Brawley told her, [...] "I'm already in trouble." [...] She described <b>how</b> <b>angry</b> King was over a previous incident of her staying out late.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Australian SBS TV network, and aired on Dateline, Litvinenko claimed {{that two of the}} Chechen terrorists involved in the 2002 Moscow theatre siege—whom he named [...] "Abdul the Bloody" [...] and [...] "Abu Bakar"—were working for the FSB, and that the agency manipulated the rebels into staging the attack. Litvinenko said, [...] "hen they tried to find [...] among the dead terrorists, they weren't there. The FSB got its agents out. So the FSB agents among Chechens organized the whole thing on FSB orders, and those agents were released." [...] This echoed similar claims made by Mikhail Trepashkin. The leading role of an FSB agent, Khanpasha Terkibaev ("Abu Bakar"), was also described by Anna Politkovskaya, Ivan Rybkin and Alexander Khinshtein. In the beginning of April 2003 Litvinenko gave [...] "the Terkibaev file" [...] to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London, who in turn passed it to Anna Politkovskaya. A few days later Yushenkov was assassinated. Terkibaev was later killed in Chechnya. According to Ivan Rybkin, a speaker of the Russian State Duma, [...] "The authorities failed to keep [...] Terkibaev out of public view, and that is why he was killed. I know <b>how</b> <b>angry</b> people were, because they knew Terkibaev had authorization from presidential administration." ...|$|E

5000|$|Transnational Speedway League {{has been}} {{described}} by commentators as one of the heaviest releases of Clutch's career. Metal Hammer writer Mörat described the album as [...] "a stark reminder of just <b>how</b> good <b>angry</b> music could sound", noting its presence in a scene dominated by [...] "the grunge explosion" [...] which was much less heavy. According to Mörat, opening song [...] "A Shogun Named Marcus" [...] had to be removed from the band's live set lists for several years [...] "because it incited people to kick the shit out of each other". The album received a Parental Advisory sticker for the repeated use of the word [...] "motherfucker" [...] in the song [...] "Binge and Purge".|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the first}} people to study anger and the control of anger was the Roman philosopher Seneca. [...] He studied anger during his lifetime, c. 4 BC – AD 65, and from his {{experiences}} and observations he formulated ways to control anger. [...] This could be considered an early form of anger management. Seneca noted the importance of how to avoid becoming <b>angry,</b> <b>how</b> to quit being <b>angry,</b> and <b>how</b> to deal with anger in other people.|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{levels of}} {{processing}} {{are thought to}} be involved in the appraisal of emotionally relevant events, with some processes being engaged relatively independently of attention, whereas other processes may depend on attention and current task goals or context. We conducted an event-related fMRI experiment to examine <b>how</b> processing <b>angry</b> voice prosody, an affectively and socially salient signal, is modulated by voluntary attention. To manipulate attention orthogonally to emotional prosody, we used a dichotic listening paradigm in which meaningless utterances, pronounced with either angry or neutral prosody, were presented simultaneously to both ears on each trial. In two successive blocks, participants selectively attended to either the left or right ear and performed a gender-decision on the voice heard on the target side. Our results revealed a functional dissociation between different brain areas. Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was hear...|$|R
