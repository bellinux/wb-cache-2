40|$|The {{wavy grain}} <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> {{expressed}} in <b>fiddleback</b> figure usually enhances its commercial value. The {{goal of this}} study was to analyse fiddleback figure and other log characteristics in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and their contribution to the price of the timber. We studied sycamore maple logs at the annual auction of the highest quality wood assortments in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. Measurements were performed on the logs and wavy grain was analysed in 2013. In addition, data were used on logs auctioned between 2007 and 2012. Using the data collected at the auction in 2013 and a binary logistic regression model, the original sample was expanded considerably. The percentage of fi ddleback maple was 7. 4 % at the auction in 2013. Larger volume of maple logs was on average linked to higher price; however, the presence <b>of</b> <b>fiddleback</b> figure in a log per se did not guarantee above average price. Prices of more than half <b>of</b> the <b>fiddleback</b> figured maple logs at the auction in 2013 were below average. On the other hand, large fiddleback logs achieved the highest prices. Trees with fiddleback figure proved to be evenly distributed throughout the entire population of sycamore maple in Slovenia. The geographic origin of sycamore maple did not influence the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>fiddleback</b> figure. The presented results appear to be representative of the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>fiddleback</b> figure in Acer pseudoplatanus throughout its entire distribution range...|$|R

However, chemical modification <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> also modifies its mechanical properties in some way. The compression strength <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> is one <b>of</b> its representative mechanical properties. Modified wood with lower values of compression strength has limited purpose. The intention of this work is to show the effect <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> modification by citric acid on the compression strength <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Fir wood (Abies alba Mill.) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) were impregnated by citric acid with sodium-dihydrogen-hypophosphite (NaH 2 PO 2) as a catalyst. Part of the impregnated samples together with control samples were cured at the temperature of 140 °C for 10 hours and the remaining samples were cured in microwaves for 35 minutes. The average compression strength parallel to the grain <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> modifi ed by CA, using different regimes of curing, was compared to the strength <b>of</b> unmodifi ed <b>wood.</b> The average compression strength parallel to the grain <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> was retained after modification.
