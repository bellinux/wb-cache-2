5|$|Because of northeasterly shear, {{the center}} of the {{circulation}} was removed from the convection, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low late on August 29. Many of the models <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that this was likely, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) instead chose to forecast slight strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{meetings}} at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that stronger military {{action would be}} implemented if the talks failed.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{often have}} {{pronounced}} responses to musical sounds and numerous videos exist showing the birds dancing to popular music. Research conducted in 2008 with an Eleonora cockatoo named Snowball <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> {{that this particular}} individual is indeed capable of beat induction—perceiving human-created music and synchronizing his body movements to the beat.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{rights are}} rarely {{discussed}} or debated publicly, and most political parties {{do not make}} any formal position, in favor of or in opposition, to LGBT rights in their party's platform or manifesto. However, some parties have responded to enquiries concerning same-sex marriage policy: the Liberal Democratic Party <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> opposition to legalizing it, and the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> support for legalization, while the Communist Party <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> support for legalizing same-sex civil unions.|$|R

5|$|Under the 1800 Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain {{returned}} the Louisiana Territory to France. In {{connection with this}} transfer, France agreed not to sell the territory to a third party; French foreign minister Talleyrand <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that a strong French Louisiana would halt the expansion of Britain and the United States in the New World.|$|E
5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Taft {{wanted to}} be chief justice, and kept {{a close eye on}} the health of the aging incumbent, Melville Fuller, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft {{believed}} Fuller likely to live many years. Roosevelt <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{proceeded}} rapidly {{during the}} week, {{but did not}} touch {{on the issue of}} Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block element and {{the second of the}} fourth-row transition elements. It {{is a member of the}} 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.|$|E

5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was {{the small amount}} of water {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that the break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals to a few tens of megapascals (from 0.3 to a few hundred bar), with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Paul W. Fairman {{replaced}} Browne {{as editor}} in September 1956. Early in Fairman's tenure, Bernard Davis {{decided to try}} issuing a companion series of novels, titled Amazing Stories Science Fiction Novels. Readers' letters in Amazing <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> a desire for novels, which Amazing did not have room to run. The novel series did not last; only one, Henry Slesar's 20 Million Miles to Earth, appeared. However, in response to readers' interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded Amazing by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.|$|E
5|$|The Partisans then {{committed}} the 16th Vojvodina Division {{to assist the}} 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation Heiderose to this point. On 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began {{to search for the}} hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years later}} a vacancy {{occurred}} at the College of Arms, the office responsible for administering English heraldic affairs. Planché was offered, and accepted, the position of Rouge Croix Pursuivant, {{one of the four}} junior-most officers of arms. Some years previously he <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> his interest in becoming an officer of arms, should a vacancy arise, to the Duke of Norfolk, who as Earl Marshal is responsible for the College of Arms. Planché was also an acquaintance of Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, the principal officer of arms at the College.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher <b>had</b> <b>indicated.</b> Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog <b>had,</b> <b>indicated</b> {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with Brighton & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but uprooting his family to move to Brighton being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with Brighton chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had chosen not to take the job. Knight <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at Brighton had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity and vowed stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
