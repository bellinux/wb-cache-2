40|$|The {{ability to}} produce high quality ultrathin (< 50 Å) thermally-grown gate dielectrics ⎯ silicon oxides (SiO 2) and oxynitrides (SiOxNy) ⎯ is {{important}} for the nextgeneration VLSI technology. However, the classical <b>Deal-Grove</b> growth <b>model</b> and its subsequent modifications cannot account for the behavior observed for silicon oxidation in the ultrathin regime (< ~ 100 Å). Even less is known for the oxynitridation mechanism. Due to the limitations of traditional surface science and “bulk ” material science techniques, there is currently no consensus on the interface structure nor the formation mechanisms of ultrathin oxide and oxynitride films. Medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) is used in combination with an isotopic labeling technique (16 O 2 / 18 O 2) to study thermally grown ultrathin (< 50 Å) SiO 2 and SiOxNy films. The very high depth resolution (< ~ 5 Å) provided by MEIS allows one to observe fundamentally different features not explained in the Deal-Grove model: the existence of a ~ 10 Å compositional transition region at the SiO 2 /Si interface, isotopic mixture during the further oxidation of very thin (14 Å) SiO 2 films in 18 O 2, and the existence of a surface reaction.

30|$|During {{the last}} decade, silicon {{nanowires}} (Si NWs) {{have been studied}} extensively to be employed in the modern electronic industry {{in the direction of}} the size reduction and efficiency boost of the devices [1]. Because of the high surface to volume ratio, Si NWs’ properties depend firmly on their surface conditions and surface terminations, in particular. The oxidation of Si NWs, when exposed to ambient air, is believed to have a detrimental effect on their electrical properties due to the low quality of the oxide, giving rise to the uncontrolled interface states and enhanced carrier recombination rates [2]. This necessitates protection of Si NWs’ surfaces against oxidation via termination by various chemical moieties (i.e., alkyls and alkenyls) [3, 4]. However, to better prevent oxide formation, a deeper understanding of the Si NW’s oxidation mechanisms and kinetics is essential. For planar Si, the widely known <b>Deal-Grove</b> (DG) <b>model</b> considers the interfacial oxidation reaction and oxidant diffusion as the major rate-determining reaction steps for short and long oxidation times, respectively [5]. DG model has undergone a number of modifications due to imprecise prediction of the oxidation behavior at low temperatures (T ≤ 700 °C) in convex/concave surfaces and for very thin oxide layers [6 – 8]. Specifically, in sufficiently small Si NWs (d ≤ 44 nm), oxidation can be completely retarded by the compressive stress normal to the oxide/NW interface [9, 10]. Nevertheless, the studies on the oxidation mechanisms of Si NWs have been focused mostly on the formation of thick oxide layers at relatively high temperatures and long times, overlooking the early stages of oxidation which involve removal of surface functionalities and suboxides formation.|$|R
5000|$|In microfabrication, thermal {{oxidation}} {{is a way}} to produce a thin layer of oxide (usually silicon dioxide) on the surface of a wafer. The technique forces an oxidizing agent to diffuse into the wafer at high temperature and react with it. The rate of oxide growth is often predicted by the <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model.</b> [...] Thermal oxidation may be applied to different materials, but this article will only consider oxidation of silicon substrates to produce silicon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|This {{technology}} {{was developed to}} insulate MOS transistors {{from each other and}} limit transistor cross-talk. The main goal is to create a silicon oxide insulating structure that penetrates under the surface of the wafer, so that the Si-SiO2 interface occurs at a lower point {{than the rest of the}} silicon surface. This cannot be easily achieved by etching field oxide. Thermal oxidation of selected regions surrounding transistors is used instead. The oxygen penetrates in depth of the wafer, reacts with silicon and transforms it into silicon oxide. In this way, an immersed structure is formed. For process design and analysis purposes, the oxidation of silicon surfaces can be modeled effectively using the <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{oxidation}}: dry oxidation and wet oxidation. During dry oxidation, dry oxygen is {{introduced into the}} process tube where it reacts with silicon. Dry oxidation is a slow process that grows films at a rate between 140 and 250 Ǻ/hour. It is typically only used to grow thin oxides (<1000 Å).During wet oxidation, water vapor is introduced into the heated oxidation tube. Because water molecules form hydroxyl structures, they diffuse faster in silicon dioxide and the oxide growth rate increases. The wet oxidation growth rate is 1000 to 1200 Ǻ/hour, so wet oxidation is the preferred method to grow thick oxides. The growth rate slows with increasing thickness, according to the <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{oxidation}} {{process can}} be well-described (Fig.  5 a) by solving Eqs.  3 – 6. The agreement between the experimental data (symbols) and the model results (solid curve) proves {{the validity of the}} model assumptions. Besides giving the useful insight on the mechanisms governing the PS size reduction and NW oxidation, these results also provide a powerful method for fabricating Si/SiO 2 NW arrays with controllable geometries. For example, to obtain a core-shell Si/SiO 2 NW with core diameter of 100  nm and shell thickness of 150  nm, one can select a starting NW diameter of 277  nm by solving the Eq.  2. If the initial diameter of the PS is 483  nm, the exposure durations to the argon plasmas were chosen as 122  s to obtain the resultant PS particle with diameter ~ 278  nm (by Eq.  1). Based on the non-close-packed PS template, the well-aligned Si NW arrays with the desired diameter can be obtained by the MACE technique. Subsequently, to obtain Si/SiO 2 NW arrays with a shell thickness of 150  nm, the oxidation time of ~ 2.5  h can be obtained by the extended <b>Deal-Grove</b> oxidation <b>model.</b> Figure  5 b shows the TEM images of the resulting core-shell structure of the Si/SiO 2 NWs. The inner part shows the silicon core which is 96  nm in diameter. The outer shell consists of silicon dioxide and its thickness is 149  nm. The TEM results prove the validity of the model. The good agreements of the experimental data and the model results also suggest that, through selecting the initial diameter and oxidation time of Si NW, the Si/SiO 2 NW arrays can be fabricated easily in terms of experimental requirements. Finally, the Si/SiO 2 NW arrays were qualitatively investigated by SEM. Figure  5 c shows low-magnification SEM images of the Si/SiO 2 NW arrays that were fabricated by MACE technique and the following thermal oxidization. The well-aligned and relatively smooth Si/SiO 2 composite NW arrays with good periodicity prove that large-scale Si/SiO 2 NW arrays with controllable geometry were realized.|$|R
40|$|Epitaxial Ge {{thin films}} are being {{investigated}} for many {{important roles in}} next generation microelectronics. Metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) utilizing Ge channels have demonstrated dramatic performance enhancements over Si based technology. Theoretical studies have predicted that tensile strain enhances both electron and hole mobilities of Ge to levels much greater than those in unstrained or compressively-strained Ge and Si. Additionally, high enough levels of tensile strain have been postulated to alter the band structure of Ge to make Ge a direct-band-gap semiconductor. We investigated the physics and fabrication of Ge/III-V compound heterostructures, where the III-V compound material {{could serve as a}} tensile-strain-inducing template for subsequent Ge epitaxy. Through experimentation and the use of characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and spreading resistance analysis (SRA), we established correlations between the initial III-V compound surface stoichiometry and the structural, optical, and electronic properties of Ge thin films deposited on GaAs and AlAs templates. We determined that the highest structural quality Ge epitaxy initiates via a bond and exchange mechanism with the surface group III element atoms, whereas group V element atoms do not bond as effectively with Ge and thin film deposition processes that rely on Ge-group V binding processes lead to 'pitting' in Ge thin films. With the developed understanding of the growth mechanisms, we successfully fabricated high quality tensile-strained Ge thin films and quantum dots on InxGaixAs templates. Tensile strain levels as high as 0. 58 % in Ge thin films and 1. 37 % in Ge quantum dots were achieved. However, the film deposition methods that facilitated the highest structural quality also led to unintentional doping characteristics that affected the electrical and optical properties of the tensile-strained Ge epitaxial structures. Nevertheless, we designed processing sequences that led to the first demonstration of room temperature, Ge direct band gap luminescence from Ge/III-V compound heterostructures. We parlayed our advancements in Ge/Ill-V compound heterostructure fabrication to demonstrate a novel process for the fabrication of GaAs-on-Insulator (GaAsOI). The combination of GaAs/Ge/GaAs heterostructure establishment, room temperature oxide-oxide bonding methods, and XeF 2 -based sacrificial etching of Ge, led to the successful fabrication of GaAsOI on a small scale. We tested the implementation of our process on a full wafer scale and determined the process was kinetically limited by the lateral Ge etch process. We adapted the <b>Deal-Grove</b> oxidation <b>model</b> to establish a model to understand the relationships between lateral etch rate, lateral etch distance, release layer thickness, channel displacements, and the radius of curvature of the donor wafer. Our Ge/III-V compound heterostructure research advanced the understanding and stateof- the-art processing of such structures.

Prediction of the oxidation of silicon cylinders (nano-wires) and spheres (nano-crystals) by simply utilizing the established planar Deal-Grovel model results in highly exaggerated oxide thicknesses compared with empirical data. This exaggeration for small silicon cylinders and spheres is due to the effects of the reduction in the available surface area for oxidation along with the stress induced due to the volumetric expansion and viscous flow of the oxide on non-planar surfaces. These stress effects retard the oxidation rate in non-planar silicon geometries with respect to flat surfaces. This reduction in the oxidation rate reduction is caused by the normal compressive stress which is normal to the SiO[subscript] 2 /Si interface due to the volumetric expansion during oxidation. This compressive stress reduces the reaction rate constant at the SiO[subscript] 2 /Si interface and thus retards the overall oxidation rate for silicon cylinders and spheres with respect to planar silicon. The focus of this paper will be to contrast cylindrical and spherical versions of the <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model</b> to the well established planar version.

Resorting to experimental results, and old and new results obtained from our model, we show in this Reply that none of the criticisms are solid and that the results of the original paper represent indeed an improvement over the <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model.</b> Finally, motivated by one of the issues raised by Roura and Farjas, we present here new fittings of experimental data using our model together with experimental estimates for the interface width between the oxide layer and the silicon substrate. This turned a two parameter fitting problem into a much simpler one parameter procedure...|$|E
40|$|Refractory diboride with {{silicon carbide}} {{additive}} {{has a unique}} oxide scale microstructure with two condensed oxide phases (solid 1 liquid), and demonstrates oxidation resistance superior to either monolithic diboride or silicon carbide. We rationalize that {{this is because the}} silica-rich liquid phase can retreat out-ward to remove the high SiO gas volatility region, while still holding onto the zirconia skeleton mechanically by capillary forces, to form a ‘‘solid pillars, liquid roof ’ ’ scale architecture and maintain barrier function. Basic assessment of the oxygen carriers in the borosilicate liquid in oxygen-rich condition is performed using first-principles calculations. It is estimated from entropy and mobility arguments that above a critical tem-perature TCB 15001 C, the dominant oxygen carriers should be network defects, such as peroxyl linkage or oxygen-deficient centers, instead of molecular O 2 as in the <b>Deal–Grove</b> <b>model.</b> These network defects will lead to sublinear dependence of the oxidation rate with external oxygen partial pressure. The pres-ent work suggests that there could be significant room in im-proving the high-temperature oxidation resistance by refining the oxide scale microstructure as well as controlling the glass chemistry.

40|$|The doping {{dependence}} of dry thermal oxidation rates in n-type 4 H-SiC was investigated. The oxidation {{was performed in}} the temperature range 1000 C to 1200 C for samples with nitrogen doping {{in the range of}} 6. 5 e 15 /cm 3 to 9. 3 e 18 /cm 3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping concentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted using a modified <b>Deal-Grove</b> <b>model.</b> Linear and parabolic rate constants and activation energies were extracted. Increasing nitrogen led to an increase in linear rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10 - 6 m/s to 10 - 2 m/s and the parabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10 e 9 m 2 /s to 10 e 6 m 2 /s. The increase in linear rate constant was attributed to defects from doping-induced lattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The increase in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to degradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice mismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in optical density of the grown oxide films from 1. 4 to 1. 24. The linear activation energy varied from 1. 6 eV to 2. 8 eV, while the parabolic activation energy varied from 2. 7 eV to 3. 3 eV, increasing with doping concentration. These increased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content, leading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in C-Si (2. 82 eV) and Si-N (4. 26 eV) binding energies. This work provides crucial information in the engineering of SiO 2 dielectrics for SiC MOS structures, which typically involve regions of very different doping concentrations, and suggests that thermal oxidation at high doping concentrations in SiC may be defect mediated.
