In Athens, for a citizen, it had significant political consequences, such as the atimia (...) loss of public civil rights. This is demonstrated in The Prosecution of Timarkhos: Aeschines is accused by Timarkhos; to defend himself, Aeschines accuses his accuser of having been a prostitute in his youth. Consequentially, Timarkhos is stripped of civil rights; one of these rights being the ability to file charges against someone.

40|$|Accounting {{textbooks}} develop separate frameworks {{to compute}} the gross profit for profitable and unprofitable contracts under the percentage completion method. The {{reason for this is}} the necessity to recognize the <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> as part of the costs of construction. This paper proposes a method that captures the economic consequences of the contract and uses the same framework for the calculation of the gross profit regardless of the financial outcome. This is achieved by disclosing the actual costs incurred as the costs of construction and then recognizing separately the provision for <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> after the gross profit. It is argued that any provision for <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> should be separately disclosed as this is viewed as important information regarding management’s performance...|$|R
60|$|I {{begin with}} America, {{as the leading}} spirit in the Conference and the {{dominant}} Power in the world. American public opinion is in favour of peace, {{and at the same}} time profoundly persuaded that America is wise and virtuous while all other Powers are foolish and wicked. The pessimistic half of this opinion I do not desire to dispute, but the optimistic half is more open to question. Apart from peace, American public opinion believes in commerce and industry, Protestant morality, athletics, hygiene, and hypocrisy, which may be taken as the main ingredients of American and English Kultur. Every American I met in the Far East, with one exception, was a missionary for American Kultur, whether nominally connected with Christian Missions or not. I ought to explain that when I speak of hypocrisy I do not mean the conscious hypocrisy practised by Japanese diplomats in their dealings with Western Powers, but that deeper, unconscious kind which forms the chief strength of the Anglo-Saxons. Everybody knows Labouchere's comment on Mr. Gladstone, that like other politicians he always had a card up his sleeve, but, unlike the others, he thought the Lord had put it there. This attitude, which has been characteristic of England, has been somewhat chastened among ourselves by the satire of men like Bernard Shaw; but in America it is still just as prevalent and self-confident as it was with us fifty years ago. There is much justification for such an attitude. Gladstonian England was more of a moral force than the England of the present day; and America is more of a moral force at this moment than any other Power (except Russia). But the development from Gladstone's moral fervour to the cynical imperialism of his successors is one which we can now see to be inevitable; and a similar development is bound to take place in the United States. Therefore, when we wish to estimate the desirability of extending the influence of the United States, we have to take account of this almost certain <b>future</b> <b>loss</b> of idealism.|$|E

40|$|Intertemporal choice, the {{tradeoff}} among outcomes {{occurring at}} different points in time, involves not only benefit options but also those associated with cost. Previous neuroimaging studies have primarily focused on discounting future gains; thus the neural mechanism underlying discounting <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> remains unidentified. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we comprehensively investigated the neural mechanism of temporal discounting using two decision-making tasks with a symmetric pattern of gains and losses. Our results revealed that the lateral prefrontal and posterior parietal areas were activated in discounting both future gains and <b>future</b> <b>losses,</b> but their activations were stronger when discounting losses. Moreover, we found that the insula, thalamus and dorsal striatum were more activated during intertemporal choices involving losses, suggesting that the enhanced sensitivity to losses may be driven by negative emotions. In addition, whereas the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex were activated when the choices included immediate options, extra regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and superior frontal gyrus were preferentially activated when the choices involved immediate losses. Taken together, our findings suggest that a fronto-parietal network supports the common discounting process, and more importantly, discounting <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> and gains occurs asymmetrically in the brain. We speculate that this may provide a neural basis for the phenomenon that <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> are discounted less steeply than future gains.

The young workers are then the first to go due to their longer remaining tenure. In contrast, when the cost of firing workers is low, the present discounted value of <b>future</b> <b>losses</b> is small at the firing margin and firms may choose to wait in the hope of a recovery. In this case they may choose to fire the older workers first since the younger ones {{are more likely to be}} around when productivity recovers. ...|$|R
