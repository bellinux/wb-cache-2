The stomach contents were composed of Ctenocalanus vanus, Stephus longipes, two unidentified calanoid species, Oithona similis, Oncaea curvata, a few unidentified harpacticoid species, nauplius of copepods and unidentified copepods. O. similis and copepod nauplius were dominant. The component species of the stomach contents resembled those of the samples collected by vertical <b>hauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plankton <b>net</b> in late autumn and in early spring. However, the relative abundance of copepod species in the stomach contents differed from that in the net samples. This may be reasonably ascribed to possible food preference of fish.

40|$|The estuarine {{turbidity}} maximum (ETM) {{that develops}} {{in the lower}} salinity areas of macrotidal estuaries has been considered as an important nursery for many fish species. Mysids {{are one of the}} dominant organisms in the ETM, serving as a key food source for juvenile fish. To investigate the horizontal distribution and population dynamics of dominant mysids in relation to the fluctuation of physical conditions (temperature, salinity, turbidity, and freshwater discharge), we conducted monthly sampling (<b>hauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ring <b>net</b> in the surface water) along the macrotidal Chikugo River estuary in Japan from May 2005 to December 2006. Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was the dominant mysid in the estuary, usually showing peaks of density and biomass in or close to the ETM (salinity 1 - 10). In addition, intra-specific differences (life-cycle stage, sex, and size) in horizontal distribution were found along the estuary. Larger males and females, particularly gravid females, were distributed upstream from the center of distribution where juveniles were overwhelmingly dominant. Juveniles increased in size toward the sea in marked contrast with males and females. The findings suggest <b>a</b> possible system <b>of</b> population maintenance within the estuary; gravid females release juveniles in the upper estuary, juveniles grow during downstream transport, young males and females mature during the upstream migration. Density and biomass were primarily controlled by seasonal changes of temperature, being high at intermediate temperatures (ca. 15 - 25 ｡・ in late spring and fall) and being low at the extreme temperatures (ca. 10 ｡・ in midwinter and 30 ｡・ in midsummer). High density (up to 666 ind. m- 3) and biomass (up to 168 mg dry weight m- 3) of H. longirostris were considered to be comparable with those of copepods in the estuary...|$|R

Data obtained in the mesocosm experiment run in the Bay of Hopavågen in August 2012 are {{used to assess the}} extent to which organic matter produced within four different food webs is retained in the upper ocean food web versus remineralized back to carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients (ammonium, dissolved silicon, phosphate) versus exported from the system in the form of rapidly sinking particles. The experiment was carried out in <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> 12 mesocosms covering, in triplicate, 2 different phytoplankton communities (diatom versus non-diatom) exposed to 2 different zooplankton communities (-copepod and +copepod). These starting conditions were established by first filling the bags, roughly simultaneously, with seawater from the Bay of Hopavågen. Mesozooplankton were then removed to the most complete extent possible immediately removed from half of the mesocosms through repeated vertical <b>hauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plankton <b>net</b> (200 µm mesh). Nitrate and phosphate was added to half mesocosms daily to promote the growth of non-siliceous phytoplankton (e. g. dinoflagellates or coccolithophores). To {{the other half of the}} mesocosms, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate were added to promote the growth of diatoms. Material was allowed to settle and the two distinct phytoplankton populations were allowed to develop for 4 days, after which copepods collected from the Bay of Hopavågen were added back to the half of the N+P mesocosms and to the half of the N+P+Si mesocosms from which mesozooplankton had not been removed at the beginning. This yielded <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> four initial starting conditions (N+P-copepods, N+P+copepods, N+P+Si-copepods, and N+P+Si+copepods).

40|$|Present global {{concern for}} the {{conservation}} of marine biodiversity (including fisheries) has resulted in the recent implementation of systems of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). No-take marine reserves (referred to throughout this thesis as marine reserves) are one type of MPA which provide permanent areas closed to all forms of fishing and extractive activities. Whilst there is <b>a</b> growing body <b>of</b> theoretical information supporting the role of marine reserves in conserving both marine biodiversity and fisheries resources, very few studies have examined their dual role empirically, particularly within inshore and coastal environments (Chapter 1). This thesis examines the effectiveness of two relatively small (< 6 km 2) inshore marine reserves in Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP) in terms of their ability to sustain fisheries species and conserve marine biodiversity. Insights from this empirical research support a refined approach to the future design and management of marine reserves in subtropical Australia. Two studies were carried out to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves in Moreton Bay for exploited fisheries species. Firstly, the impact of deliberate sex-biased fishing and marine reserve protection on the mud crab Scylla serrata was assessed (Chapter 2). Using catch and release sampling through the use of baited crab pots the catch rates (catch-per-unit-effort CPUE), mean size, sex ratios and movement were determined for S. serrata and compared in two coastal marine reserves (1. 9 and 5. 7 km 2) and four non-reserve fished sites. The marine reserves surveyed in this study were located in different geographical locations in Moreton Bay (north and south). Five years after establishment (closure), both marine reserves supported higher catch rates and a larger mean size of S. serrata than non-reserve sites. Sex ratios of mature male and female crabs revealed a strong skew (2 : 1) towards mature males in both marine reserves whilst a skew towards females was found in all non-reserve sites, which was most likely <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the ban on taking female S. serrata in Moreton Bay. Of the 472 S. serrata captured in this study, 338 were tagged in the reserves in order to document their movement. Of the 37 recaptured crabs, 69 % were recorded inside the reserves with some spillover of crabs recorded in fished areas. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of small (< 6 km 2) inshore marine reserves for a sex-biased exploited invertebrate fisheries species. The protection afforded to inshore habitats of S. serrata in Moreton Bay highlight the benefits, both within and acrossboundary (spillover), that small marine reserves provide to relatively sessile marine invertebrates which has important implications for the design and location of future marine reserves in Moreton Bay. My second study to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for fisheries species was focused on marine reserve protection of exploited finfish species (Acanthopagrus australis, Platycephalus fuscus and Pomadasys kaakan) (Chapter 3). Using experimental angling (catch and release) the relative density, mean size and biomass of fish were determined and compared between the marine reserves and non-reserve fished sites. Again, results revealed that after just five years of protection both marine reserves supported significantly higher relative density, mean size (except P. kaakan) and biomass of exploited finfish species. The most popular angling species in Moreton Bay, A. australis and P. fuscus, responded most to reserve protection with at least three times higher density, a 10 % increase in mean size and at least 15 % greater biomass within both marine reserves compared to non-reserve sites. Tag recapture data for A. australis (a mobile species) and P. fuscus (a relatively sedentary species) revealed that although recapture rates were low both species were recorded outside reserve boundaries in adjacent fished waters. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of small (< 6 km 2) inshore marine reserves in providing protection to multiple exploited finfish species despite their variable movement patterns. This empirical evidence strengthens the use of marine reserves as a precautionary multi-species management tool, which could complement existing fisheries management in Moreton Bay and assist in the design and location of future marine reserves in subtropical Australia. To assess the potential dual benefits of the marine reserves in Moreton Bay I assessed the effectiveness of the marine reserves in terms of their protection for marine biodiversity (ie. nekton) (Chapter 4). Catch and release sampling using multiple <b>hauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seine <b>net</b> were used to survey the two marine reserves and four corresponding non-reserve sites. Species richness, evenness (Bulla, E), density and mean size of the inshore communities were compared between the reserves and non-reserve fished sites. No statistical significant difference was detected in species richness between the sites however species evenness was significantly lower in the only non-reserve site impacted by commercial net fishing. There was no statistical significant difference detected in density and mean size of nekton between the marine reserves and nonreserve sites. Multivariate analysis revealed differences in community composition, particularly between the geographical locations where sites were impacted by different types of fishing pressure (recreational v commercial). These findings highlight the impact commercial fishing can have on entire nekton assemblages, not just on targeted species. Further, {{the results of this study}} demonstrated that the small (< 6 km 2) inshore marine reserves in Moreton Bay are protecting aspects of marine biodiversity and are thus at least partially achieving their management objective (to enhance the zones marine biodiversity), which has important implications for the design and location of future conservation marine reserves in the Marine Park. The final component of this thesis provides a qualitative two-part review of conservation planning in Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP) (Chapter 5). The aim of this review was to 1. provide <b>a</b> historical account <b>of</b> conservation planning of the MBMP and 2. provide an improved approach for future conservation planning for the MBMP, both of which are discussed in terms of the empirical findings of the first three studies (Chapters 2 - 4). Firstly, <b>a</b> review <b>of</b> conservation planning of the MBMP revealed that the existing system of marine reserves were established following an ad hoc and highly political process. Despite this approach the empirical findings of the three studies (Chapters 2 - 4) revealed that the marine reserves were effective in providing dual benefits to the marine environment. Considering the important implications of this empirical evidence the second component of the review suggests improvements to future conservation planning in MBMP, particularly in light of the upcoming re-zoning of the Marine Park. A holistic approach to the upcoming re-zoning is recommended through the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combination approach which incorporates the biophysical, political and social components of marine reserve effectiveness. A combination approach would need to adopt the following components: a science-based approach to MPA planning (biophysical); <b>a</b> whole <b>of</b> government approach encouraging the collaboration of marine resource government agencies (political); and ensure that stakeholder consultation process is extensive, open and transparent (social). Each of these components are discussed in terms of the empirical findings of this research coupled with lessons learned worldwide from similar re-zoning exercises. This review proposes an improved approach to conservation planning in Moreton Bay Marine Park which forms the basis for <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> general recommendations for marine resource practitioners charged with the upcoming re-zoning (Chapter 6) ...|$|R
