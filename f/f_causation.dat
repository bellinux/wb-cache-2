At the same time the value of social allowances is diminishing. The results o f the study into the above show that there is no direct chain o <b>f</b> <b>causation</b> between the funds allocated to social security payments in town budgets and the size of social security threats, or between the outlays on social support {{on the one hand and}} the social sphere threats and the wealth of a given town on the other. The relationship between the size of budget outlays, the financing of social support and social risk factors has been found to function much more satisfactorily in smaller towns. An analysis of the security allowances structure paid from municipal budgets that were subject of the study shows that apart from being very rigid, that structure has been for years dominated by different forms o f support to the result that it has only very slightly activated the resources o f the social support beneficiaries. Consequently, although many recipients of social allowances receive support, those payments are only stop-gap solutions, incapable of inducing a radical change in the social and economic situation of the beneficiaries. Therefore the risk o f losing social security continues and the system fails to encourage independence and taking one’s life in one’s hands. The fact that there are no ways to change the conditions that generate the reasons why social support might be required, may, in extreme cases, become an „incubator of inaptitude” because those who become beneficiaries of social care institutions return to them with the same or even grater needs or problems, constantly losing the feeling of social security, incapable o f taking care of themselves. This may lead, in turn, to their entering the spiral o f longterm poverty and helplessness (not to mention the quality of social care) ...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the nature}} of mind? Here I explore a new {{perspective}} on the question. Motivated by Jaegwon Kim's 1998 discussion, The Many Problems o <b>f</b> Mental <b>Causation,</b> this response proposes an alternative ontology for the mind. I claim that the mental is a relation between relational maps. A relational map is defined as a particular subclass of relation, giving information in an orderly form according to some convention of representation. One map (the lower relational map) consists of the relations among internal states of an organism and its environment. The second (upper) relational map consists of relations among neurons within the physical brain of the organism. Mentality then ontologically is a relation between relations. The relation between relational maps supplies an intrinsically centered semantics, and is a complete ontological description of the mind. I use the physical example of a simple organism, C. elegans, to ground the claim in biology and to initiate several thought experiments. The relational ontology provides an answer to Kim's most critical problems of causation. There are implications for related puzzles in the philosophy of mind...|$|R
