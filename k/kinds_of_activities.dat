25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E
500|$|Charitable trusts have {{historically}} been invalid if they include [...] "purely recreational pastimes", as in IRC v City of Glasgow Police Athletic Association; even though {{the purpose of the}} charity was to improve the efficiency of the police force, the fact that this included a recreational element invalidated the trust. In response to this case and IRC v Baddely, the Recreational Charities Act 1958 was passed, which provides that [...] "it shall be and be deemed always to have been charitable to provide, or assist in the provision of, facilities for recreation or other leisure-time occupation, if the facilities are provided in the interest of social welfare". Section 1(1) of the Act, however, preserves the need to provide a [...] "public benefit". The Act also lays out what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> are in the [...] "interest of social welfare", stating in Section 1(2) that it is where the facilities [...] "are provided with the object of improving the conditions of life for the persons for whom the facilities are primarily provided" [...] and in Section 1(2)(a) [...] "those persons have need of such facilities as aforesaid by reason of their youth, age, infirmity or disablement, poverty or social and economic circumstances", or where, in Section 1(2)(b) [...] "the facilities are available to members... of the public at large".|$|E

[...] Their proposed use—to have [...] "a fun time of singing songs, hearing a Bible lesson and memorizing scripture"—was deemed to {{be the equivalent of}} religious worship, and the Fourniers' application was denied on that basis; the school also claimed that its community use policy forbade use [...] "by any individual or organization for religious purposes." [...] The Fourniers contacted the school superintendent stating that they did not believe it was lawful for the school to allow other groups to use the school building, yet because they were religious in nature, teaching morals and values from a Christian perspective, they were denied access. [...] The school concluded that [...] "the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> proposed to be engaged in by the Good News Club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing, development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective, but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself." [...] The full school board rejected the club's application to use Milford's facilities.|$|E
