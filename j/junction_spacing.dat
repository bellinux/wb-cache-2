5000|$|A typical {{integrated}} circuit layout for {{an array of}} 20 208 junctions is shown in Fig. 6. The microwave drive power is collected from a waveguide by a finline antenna, split 16 ways, and injected into 16 junction strip lines of 1263 junctions each. The junction striplines are separated from a superconductive ground plane by about 2 micrometers of SiO2 dielectric. Symmetry in the splitting network ensures that the same power is delivered to each subarray. Several precautions are required to avoid reflections {{that would lead to}} standing waves and the consequent nonuniform power distribution within the subarrays: (1) Each stripline is terminated by a matched load that consists of several wavelengths of resistive strip line. The use of resistive stripline rather than a discrete resistor guarantees a near perfect match over a wide range of fabrication parameters. The dimensions of capacitors in the low- and high-pass filters are chosen to avoid resonances near the drive frequency. (3) The microwave bend radius has a minimum value of three times the stripline width. Sharper bends result in unacceptable reflections. In order to meet the bend requirement while still packing the array strips close together, [...] "curly" [...] bends that turn 215° and then back 45° are used. (4) The <b>junction</b> <b>spacing</b> along the line must be close enough to avoid a resonance between adjacent junctions. Microwave power is applied by inserting the finline end of the chip into a slot parallel to the E-field in a WR-12 waveguide. The dc output appears across superconducting pads {{at the edge of the}} chip.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the interfacial recombination velocity at Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 75 As/GaAs and Al 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As/GaAs heterojunctions.

For double-heterojunction spacings below 1 micron, the constancy of the minority-carrier lifetime suggests that the interfacial recombination velocity decreases effectively.

The goal of my thesis is to understand eEF 1 A 2 ’s role in oncogenesis. In order to determine if eEF 1 A 2 was a prognostic marker for ovarian cancer, we examined eEF 1 A 2 expression in 500 primary human ovarian tumours. We show that eEF 1 A 2 is highly expressed in approximately 30 % of ovarian tumours. In serous cancer, high expression of eEF 1 A 2 was associated with an increased 20 -year survival probability. Expression of eEF 1 A 2, in a clear cell carcinoma cell line, SK-OV- 3, increased the cells ability to form spheroids in hanging drop culture, enhanced in vitro proliferative capacity, increased stress fiber formations, and reduced cell-cell <b>junction</b> <b>spacing.</b> Expression of eEF 1 A 2 did not alter sensitivity to anoikis, cisplatin, or taxol. In order to examine the role of eEF 1 A 2 in breast cancer, we used a three-dimensional culture system. The ability to disrupt the in vitro morphogenesis of breast cells cultured on reconstituted basement membranes is a common property of breast oncogenes. I found that phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase (PI 4 KIIIβ), a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) to PI(4) P, disrupts in vitro mammary acinar formation. The PI 4 KIIIβ protein localizes to the basal surface of acini created by the human MCF 10 A cells and ectopic expression of PI 4 KIIIβ induces multi-acinar formation. Expression of the PI 4 KIIIβ activator, eEF 1 A 2, also causes a multi-acinar phenotype. Ectopic expression of PI 4 KIIIβ or eEF 1 A 2 alters PI(4) P and PI(4, 5) P 2 localization, indicating a role for these lipids in acinar development. Therefore, eEF 1 A 2 is highly expressed in ovarian carcinomas and its expression enhances cell growth in vitro. eEF 1 A 2 expression {{is likely to be a}} useful ovarian cancer prognostic factor in ovarian patients with serous tumours. Furthermore, PI 4 KIIIβ and eEF 1 A 2 both have an important role in the disruption of three-dimensional morphogenesis of MCF 10 A cells. Additionally, PI 4 KIIIβ and eEF 1 A 2 likely have an important role in mammary neoplasia and development and could be anti-cancer targets...|$|E
