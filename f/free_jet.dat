2500|$|A <b>free</b> <b>jet</b> {{water turbine}} or impulse water turbine, also {{commonly}} known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each [...] "spoke" [...] in the wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed {{at the center of}} each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} use of <b>free</b> liquid <b>jets</b> for high speed immunoassays. Fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are employed for readout.

Theoretical underpinnings of this method are put forward to explain {{the basis for the}} dramatic reductions in sample and label incubation times through comparisons in surface accumulation. Immunoassay incubation by <b>free</b> liquid <b>jet</b> was extended to detect a simulant for biowarfare agents with SERS detection. The theoretical model of accumulation via quiet solution and <b>free</b> liquid <b>jets</b> is extended to account for the observations in sample capture and labeling efficiency therein.
