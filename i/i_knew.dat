5|$|I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me and I thought they ought to know. Had they been wise, hearing what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> and therefore what others knew, {{they ought to have}} hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|I was at {{the command}} post and {{listening}} to the radio communication between the pilots. I realised immediately something serious had happened; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they were still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was emitting a lot of smoke.|$|E
5|$|To {{tell the}} truth, I wasn't all that {{fond of the}} damned thing by then, but {{it had become a}} symbol for the men of the 8th Wing. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> McConnell understood. During his visits to Ubon over the past year he had never {{referred}} to my breach of military standards, just seemed rather amused at the variety of 'staches sported by many of the troops. (It) was the most direct order I had received in twenty-four years of service.|$|E

5|$|You made me very low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes.

5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

40|$|In 1995, I {{wrote an}} essay 'Existence'. From the {{analysis}} of the process of self-consciousness, I concluded: "All <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> only <b>I</b> know", because if YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know', only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that 'YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know'', and if you <b>know</b> that 'only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that 'YOU <b>know</b> 'what <b>I</b> know''', only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that [...] . etc. At every moment, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> something more (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> that YOU know), or something less (<b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> that YOU <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know)</b> - than YOU. The consciousness is thus indivisible implying the permanent 'existential solitude' at the very bottom of each existence. The article was exhibited in Holland Park, W 8 6 LU, The Ice House between 18. Oct - 3. Nov. 2013...|$|R
