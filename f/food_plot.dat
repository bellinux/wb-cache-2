2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E

40|$|Landowners who are {{managing}} their land for white-tailed deer may consider planting <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> {{to provide a}} supplemental food source. On some properties, establishing and maintaining <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> can provide supplemental food and nutrition for deer, but <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> should never be considered a substitute for managing the native vegetation to provide quality food sources. In situations where <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> would contribute to deer management objectives, the plots need to be established and maintained properly...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Food</b> <b>plots</b> {{differ from}} revegetation, which is {{intended}} to stabilize and rebuild the soil of disturbed land using naturally growing grasses, legumes, shrubs, and trees. <b>Food</b> <b>plots</b> are intended to feed wildlife rather than rebuild the soil, and generally use agricultural forages rather than native or naturally occurring plants. The oldest company to start developing products for <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> is the Whitetail Institute of North America in 1988.|$|R
40|$|A key {{challenge}} for wildlife management is to handle competing goals. High ungulate densities may be desirable from hunting and recreational perspectives, but {{may come in}} conflict with needs to limit or reduce browsing damage. Since browsing intensity is negatively related to forage availability {{it may be possible}} to mitigate damage on forest by increasing forage availability within the landscape. A commonly used method to increase the attractiveness of a localized part of the landscape is to establish <b>food</b> <b>plots.</b> In a multiyear setup using enclosures, wildlife observations, field surveys, and controlled biomass removal, we studied <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> to document forage production, utilization by ungulates, and browsing on adjacent forests in southern Sweden. The fenced parts of the <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> produced on average 2230 to 5810 kg ha. 1 marrow-stem kale, second-year clover mix or early-sown rapeseed. The biomass of target crops was generally higher within ungrazed (exclosures) compared to grazed (controls) quadrats on the <b>food</b> <b>plots,</b> which demonstrates that the crops were used as forage by ungulates. Browsing on deciduous trees in the adjacent forest was higher within 70 - 135 m from the <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> compared to areas further away. For wildlife management, our study shows that establishment of <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> provides substantial amounts of forage both during growing season and at the onset of the dormant season, and that a large share of this food is consumed. Finally, our study documents that forage availability for ungulates at the onset of the often-limiting dormant season can be increased by fencing <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> throughout the growing season...|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} farmers and landowners may be {{reimbursed}} {{by the government}} for providing foot plots that meet government specifications. Among other considerations, a <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> should be located close to a source of cover for the animals, {{and it should be}} only one part of a comprehensive habitat management program.

However, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) tend to eat the sorghum when it starts to ripen in September and continue feeding on it through November and December, often leaving no food for the quail during the winter. We conducted pen and field trails to determine if repellents were an effective and feasible method to protect grain sorghum <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> from deer damage. Two-choice pen trials with both deer and game bird species were used to determine preference and avoidance of milo treated with Liquid Fence® and Plantskydd™. Individual <b>food</b> <b>plots</b> on Fort Riley were used to test both repellents’ effectiveness in protecting a 6 -row perimeter around established <b>food</b> <b>plots.</b> When given a choice both bobwhite quails and pheasants avoided Plantskydd (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Both repellents were avoided versus the control in the pen trials for white-tailed deer (P ≤ 0. 0001); however, we found no difference in seed head damaged between field control plots and plots treated with Liquid Fence or those with Plantskydd (F 7, 23 = 0. 88, P = 0. 54).

40|$|Cultivation of game plots is {{a common}} {{traditional}} practice in Hungarian game management. However, it has significant costs. Efficiency of this measure therefore, should be controlled. In our study we investigated the utilisation of four game plots and <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage (rye, Secale cereale) in Valkó throughout an entire year from April 2007 to March 2008. Our study aim {{was to determine the}} intensity of area use by deer on food plots and estimate the biomass of the <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage consumed. We conducted faeces counts in every 2 or 4 week. We also measured the difference between the total biomass of grazed and ungrazed plant individuals and that of enclosed (untouched) and control (grazed) sampling areas. We found that red deer appear in food plots in every season, although there were clear differences in the deer dropping density between different periods. The highest values of the intensity of area use in game plots were revealed in autumn (October-November). However, {{in the first half of}} the year there was no significant difference in the deer faces density between the game plots and control forest areas. Similarly, significantly more plant biomass was consumed (has disappeared) from the <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage during the September-October period (30 - 90 kg/ha/day) than in the other parts of the year (0 - 10 kg/ha/day). We suggest that <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage – or at least rye – has no fundamental dietary significance for red deer. Since the utilisation of game plots and <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage became the highest in the roaring period in autumn, importance of social factors in visiting game plots can be more fundamental than that of dietary ones. We think that it is hard to prove the clear dietary benefits of <b>food</b> <b>plot</b> forage for red deer at a population level. However, increasing effectiveness of trophy hunting during the roaring season could be an achievable and more easily measurable goal of game plot management. ...|$|E

40|$|Landowners {{and other}} {{wildlife}} enthusiasts often desire instant gratification when attempting to attract wildlife to their properties. Advertisements distributed by television programs, outdoor publications, and conservation organizations have played a large part in creating the desire for a quick and easy fix. Landowners are erroneously led to believe food plots or plantings of nonnative shrubs and trees will raise the carrying capacity for target wildlife species, even though the typical privately-held property contains overstocked, high-graded timber, intensively maintained croplands, mowed roadsides and drainage ditches, fire-suppressed woodlands, and pastures vegetated with non-native grasses that provide no cover and poor-quality forage. In North Carolina, state agency biologists and county Extension agents receive more requests for information about food plots than they do for information about prescribed burning or timber harvest.
