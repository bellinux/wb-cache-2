5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|The group {{included}} Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona's mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns {{had known the}} Paynes for years; <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> met Fiona in 2000 when they both worked in Leicester General Hospital's intensive care unit. Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kate</b> <b>has</b> {{established}} {{her reputation}} as a performer with interactive audio-visual live sets and cutting edge DJ mixes. Named one of Chicago’s “Top 10 DJs” by XLR8R Magazine, <b>Kate</b> <b>has</b> played clubs and festivals around the world.|$|R

50|$|As of November 2016, <b>Kate</b> <b>has</b> a {{contentious}} {{relationship with her}} ex-husband, which has repeatedly made headlines. They have continued to battle over custody of the children, as Jon plans to take Kate to court for joint physical and legal custody of them. Currently, <b>Kate</b> <b>has</b> full custody of the twins and sextuplets while he has visitation.|$|R
5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensington—the eldest, <b>Kate,</b> <b>had</b> married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence of spirit, and differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> been asking about him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling. Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). He also moves into Number 24.|$|E

25|$|Gar Neale's great {{grandfather}} and family migrated to New Zealand from Stroud, Gloucestershire, England in the 1840s, settling in Auckland. In the 1850s Gar Neale's grandfather, John William Neale, moved to Nelson. Gar Neale's father, Henry Neale, {{was born in}} Nelson {{and worked as a}} carpenter. Henry married Kate Bethwaite. Henry and <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> two children; Gar (born in 1889 in Nelson) and Gladys (born in 1893).|$|E
25|$|In July 1896, it was {{reported}} that <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> applied to the Iowa legislature for employment in the State House as a menial because she was destitute and had to support her mother and invalid brother. She worked at the Iowa State Capitol more than once, but the rumor of an invalid brother was untrue, as John, her surviving one, worked for the Chicago and North Western Railway for most of his life. Ongoing reports that her mother was an invalid or was in ill health, requiring constant care, were also refuted over the years. She died in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Terry {{married three}} times and was {{involved}} in numerous relationships. In London, during her engagement at the Haymarket Theatre, {{she and her sister}} <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> their portraits painted by the eminent artist George Frederic Watts. His famous portraits of Terry include Choosing, in which she must select between earthly vanities, symbolised by showy but scentless camellias, and nobler values symbolised by humble-looking but fragrant violets. His other famous portraits of her include Ophelia and Watchman, and, with Kate, The Sisters. He proposed marriage to Terry in spite of his being three decades her senior. She was impressed with Watts's art and elegant lifestyle, and she wished to please her parents by making an advantageous marriage. She left the stage during the run of Tom Taylor's hit comedy Our American Cousin at the Haymarket, in which she played Mary Meredith.|$|E

500|$|Holliday and his on-again, off-again {{mistress}} Big Nose <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> many fights. After {{a particularly}} nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff John Behan and Milt Joyce {{saw an opportunity}} and exploited the situation. They plied Big Nose Kate with more booze and suggested to her {{a way to get}} even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the attempted stagecoach robbery and murders. Holliday was a good friend of Bill Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York, one of three men implicated in the robbery. Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday's location {{at the time of the}} murders and Kate sobered up, revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she didn't understand. With the Cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them [...] "ridiculous." [...] Doc gave Kate some money and put her on a stage out of town.|$|E
500|$|Kate McCann's {{appearance}} and demeanour were widely discussed, {{with much of}} the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books. Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not [...] "shed a single tear". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: [...] "How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?" ...|$|E

500|$|With a {{ridge to}} its north, Kate tracked westward after developing, and an upper-level low {{developed}} {{to the southwest}} of the storm. The {{combination of the two}} provided favorable outflow, allowing Kate to quickly intensify. On November16, the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern Bahamas. After continued strengthening, Kate made landfall at 0600UTC on November19 over north-central Cuba with a well-defined eye. When it moved ashore, <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> a pressure of [...] and winds of about [...] The hurricane maintained its well-defined eye while moving across northern Cuba, and about 12hours after making landfall, it emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico just east of Havana. Over the next 24hours, Kate re-intensified off the southwest coast of Florida as it passed about 85mi (135km) southwest of Key West. On November20, the Hurricane Hunters observed winds as strong as 125mph (200km/h), and a buoy recorded a gust of this was the highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Lili in 2002. Based on these observations, it was estimated that Kate attained peak winds of about [...] around 1200UTC on November20.|$|E
500|$|Aware of {{the efforts}} her mother made to give her life, support her and raise her, Millett became a care-giver and {{coordinator}} of many daily therapies, and pushed her mother to be active. She {{wanted to give her}} [...] "independence and dignity". In the article [...] "Her Mother, Herself", Pat Swift wrote: [...] "Helen Millett might have been content to go [...] "gently into that good night"—she was after all more afraid of the nursing home than dying—but daughter Kate was having none of that. Feminist warrior, human rights activists, gay liberationist, writer and artist, Kate Millett has not gone gently through life and never hesitates to rage at anyone—friend or foe, family or the system—to right a perceived wrong. When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother's life was at stake, this book's unfolding tale became inevitable." [...] Even though Helen played a role in having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota's Mayo wing, <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also [...] "bully" [...] her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} island, Kate is famous {{as one of}} the Oceanic Six. [...] She is tried for her {{numerous}} crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty. [...] Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a character witness. [...] He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. [...] Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) {{for the first time in}} four years. [...] Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that <b>Kate</b> <b>had</b> died in the plane crash. [...] When Diane, the prosecution's star witness, no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. [...] Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks to go out for coffee with her. [...] Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby. [...] It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son Aaron (William Blanchette) as her own.|$|E
