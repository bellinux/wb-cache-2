Based on evidence from two datasets that together span from 1740 to the present, this paper shows that de Piles ’ four characteristics are each both currently and historically correlated with prices achieved at auction. The effect of de Piles ’ drawing characteristic on price has steadily decreased over the period 1736 - 1960 while the effect of de Piles ’ color characteristic appears to have increased over the same period. De Piles ’ overall ratings have also withstood the test of a very long period of time, with estimates indicating that the works of his higher-rated artists achieved a greater return than his lower rated artists. The annual returns of all artists that he rated achieved comparable returns to other art indices...|$|E
40|$|Common {{pharmacological}} {{treatments of}} mood disorders aim to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission and enhance serotonin {{levels in the}} brain. Brain serotonin levels are dependent {{on the availability of}} its food-derived precursor essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp). We tested the hypothesis that delivery of Trp via food may serve as an alternative treatment, and examined the effects of a Trp-rich, bioavailable dietary supplement from egg protein hydrolysate on cognitive and emotional functions, mood state, and sleep quality. In a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel trial, fifty-nine mentally and physically healthy women aged 45 - 65 years received placebo (n 30) or the supplement (n 29) (both as 0 · 5 g twice per d) for 19 d. Emotional processing was significantly changed by supplementation, exhibiting a shift in bias away from negative stimuli. The results for the Affective Go/No-Go Task exhibited a slowing of responses to negative words, suggesting reduced attention to negative emotional stimuli. The results for the Facial Emotional <b>Expression</b> <b>Rating</b> Task also supported a shift away from attention to negative emotions and a bias towards happiness. An increase in arousal-like symptoms, labelled ‘high energy', shorter reaction times and a slight benefit to sustained attention were observed in the treated subjects. Finally, when the supplement was taken 60 - 90 min before bedtime, a feeling of happiness before going to bed was consistently reported. In summary, daily consumption of a low-dose supplement containing bioavailable Trp may have beneficial effects on emotional and cognitive function...|$|E
40|$|The present study, {{which is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} project on EI skills (founded by CARIPARO foundation), tested a new face database containing Caucasian face images. In particular, since ceiling effects are prominent in various facial emotion recognition tasks, we developed a database that contained faces expressing emotions at different intensities. Nine young adults posed the emotions of happiness, surprise, disgust, sadness, fear, and anger, plus a neutral expression. Encoders were asked to pose ‘normal’ expressions, plus toned-down, minimized expressions. All expressions were later coded using FACS (Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002). On the basis of the FACS intensity levels, pictures were classified in high (prototypical) and low intensity pictures. 278 adolescents (226 females; M age= 17) were presented with 32 pictures. Image order was randomized. For each image, participants judged the depicted expression (the <b>expression</b> <b>rating</b> was forced-choice with eight response categories), the intensity, the clarity, the genuineness, the valence and the attractiveness of the expression. Analyses showed that at both high and low intensity level the participants recognized better some expressions (happiness and disgust) than others (fear and anger), F(6, 414) = 32, 35, p<. 001. Moreover the high intensity expressions were more accurately recognized than low intensity pictures except for fear expression, (F(5, 660) = 19, 84, p<. 001) that was better recognized at low intensities, t(211) =- 3, 88, p=. 002. This result could be explained by an effect of genuineness F(5, 645) = 13, 88, p <. 001 : compared with allother expressions, the fear expression was judged more genuine at low intensity than at high intensity, t(211) = 3, 09, p=. 002. The results suggested that this new face database could represent an alternative method to test emotions recognition in that it could offer a subtler way to assess this emotional ability...|$|E

40|$|The negativity bias {{has been}} shown in many fields, {{including}} in face processing. We assume that this bias stems from the potential threat inlayed in the stimuli (e. g., negative moral behaviors) in previous studies. In the present study, we conducted one behavioral and one event-related potentials (ERPs) experiments to test whether the positivity bias rather than negativity bias will arise when participants process information whose negative aspect involves no threat, i. e., the ability information. In both experiments, participants first completed a valence rating (negative-to-positive) of neutral facial expressions. Further, in the learning period, participants associated the neutral faces with high-ability, low-ability, or control sentences. Finally, participants rated these facial expressions again. Results of the behavioral experiment showed that compared with pre-learning, the expressions of the faces associated with high ability sentences were classified as more positive in the post-learning <b>expression</b> <b>rating</b> task, and the faces associated with low ability sentences were evaluated as more negative. Meanwhile, the change in the high-ability group was greater than that of the low-ability group. The ERP data showed that the faces associated with high-ability sentences elicited a larger early posterior negativity, an ERP component considered to reflect early sensory processing of the emotional stimuli, than the faces associated with control sentences. However, no such effect was found in faces associated with low-ability sentences. To conclude, high ability sentences exerted stronger influence on expression perception than did low ability ones. Thus, we found a positivity bias in this ability-related facial perceptual task. Our findings demonstrate an effect of valenced ability information on face perception, thereby adding to the evidence on the opinion that person-related knowledge can influence face processing. What’s more, the positivity bias in non-threatening surroundings increases scope for studies on processing bias...|$|E

In our {{previous}} study, significantly high expression levels of matrix-remodeling associated 5 (MXRA 5) {{were identified in}} fresh-cultured colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with their normal adjacent mucosa by differential secretome analysis. Whether MXRA 5 is a potential serum biomarker of CRC has not been evaluated. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between MXRA 5 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of CRC patients. The MXRA 5 expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 20 colorectal adenoma tissues, 156 CRC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal mucosa. Relative quantity (RQ) value and immunoreactive score (IRS) were used for quantitative assessment. The staining for MXRA 5 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of CRC cells. All CRC tissues were positively stained, with a higher <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> (IRS> 4) of 67 % (105 / 156), and a lower <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> (IRS≤ 4) of 33 % (51 / 156). Meanwhile, their corresponding normal tissues exhibited little positive staining; the higher <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was 0 % (0 / 156) and the lower <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was 25 % (16 / 156). Additionally, more than half of the adenoma tissues were positively stained; the higher <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was 15 % (3 / 20) and the lower <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was 50 % (10 / 20). The MXRA 5 protein positive staining rates were significantly correlated with the lesion sites (colon vs. rectum, 76 vs. 59 %), TNM staging (I+II vs. III+IV, 56 vs. 73 %) and metastasis (present vs. absent; 76 vs. 61 %) with the most high positive staining rate observable in omental metastasis (82 %). However, MXRA 5 mRNA expression levels showed no significant differences between CRC tissues and their corresponding normal tissues, and no significant correlation between IRS and corresponding RQ value was observed. In this study, we present the first evaluation of MXRA 5 protein expression in CRC tissue. Our results revealed that MXRA 5 protein is aberrantly expressed in CRC tissues, and has potential value in early detection of CRC and prediction of omental metastasis...|$|R

The results of our DNA microarray analysis using three strains showed increased expression ratios under heat conditions for FMP 21, YER 034 W and PRM 5. However, in the verification test, the <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of YER 034 W showed the lowest correlation among the three genes. In addition, the <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of PRM 5 was significantly increased by heat treatment only in the NFRI 3236 strain. The expression levels in some of the genes were very different among the yeast strains, which had different genetic backgrounds. PRM 5 {{is also one of the}} genes whose expression strongly depends on the genetic backgrounds of the strains.|$|R
40|$|Objective Signaling {{pathways}} such as extracellular regulated kinase/mitogen activated {{protein kinase}} (ERK/MAPK) have increased activity in leukemia. Ribosomal 6 kinase (RSK 4) {{is a factor}} downstream of the MAPK/ERK pathway and an important tumor suppressor which inhibits ERK trafficking. Decrease in RSK 4 expression {{has been reported in}} some malignancies, which leads to an increase in growth and proliferation and eventually poor prognosis. In this study we measured RSK 4 <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2013 - 2014 at Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, on 40 AML patients and 10 non-AML patients as the control group. The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was measured by real-time polymerase change reaction (PCR) and employing the ΔΔCT method. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests using SPSS (version 11. 5). Results <b>Expression</b> <b>rate</b> of RSK 4 was significantly decreased in the AML group in comparison with the non-AML group (P< 0. 001). There was also a significant decrease in RSK 4 expression in AML with t(15; 17) in comparison to other translocations (P= 0. 004). Conclusion We detected a down-regulation of RSK 4 in AML patients. This may lead to an increase in the activity of the ERK/MPAK pathway and exacerbate leukemogenesis or the prognosis of the patients...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a multidrug resistance marker and the p 53 tumour-suppressor protein in canine mammary tumours. A total of 30 tumours were examined in parallel to patient history. The tumours were allotted to four groups: tubulopapillar carcinomas, complex carcinomas, benign tumours, and other malignant tumours. A monoclonal mouse antibody (C 494) was used for the immunohistochemical evaluation of Pgp and a polyclonal rabbit antibody for p 53. We found that the intact ductal epithelium and connective tissue showed pronounced Pgp expression. The most intensive staining was detected in tubulopapillar carcinomas for both Pgp and p 53. The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of Pgp and p 53 differed significantly between tubulopapillar carcinoma and complex carcinoma, and between tubulopapillar carcinoma and benign mammary tumour, respectively. The expressions of Pgp and p 53 highly correlated statistically; therefore, both can determine malignancy in a similar manner. In the case of tubulopapillar carcinomas, more relapsed tumours occurred than in relation to complex carcinomas and other malignant tumours. Pgp <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> was proportional to the probability of the tumour becoming recidivant postoperatively, as well. These results suggest that routine evaluation of Pgp expression in canine mammary tumours may be prognostically helpful...|$|R

Here, we show a systematic approach to successfully express a full-length protein of interest by using cell-free and cell-based expression systems. Results In a pre-screen, we evaluated the expression of 960 human full-length open reading frames in Escherichia coli (in vivo and in vitro). After analysing the protein <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> and solubility, we chose a subset of 87 plasmids yielding no protein product in E. coli in vivo. These targets were subjected to a more detailed analysis comparing a prokaryotic cell-free E. coli system with an eukaryotic wheat germ system.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the histopathological characteristics of inverted papillomas of the urinary bladder, including {{the possibility of}} malignant transformation, we studied the indicators of cellular proliferation activity in 7 inverted papillomas of the bladder including two cases of malignant inverted papilloma of the bladder. PCNA <b>expression</b> <b>rates</b> in two cases of malignant inverted papilloma were higher than in benign inverted papillomas. Mean numbers of AgNORs per nucleus in malignant inverted papillomas were much more than in benign inverted papillomas. The c-erbB- 2 oncoprotein was expressed only in malignant inverted papillomas. These results suggest that PCNA <b>expression</b> <b>rate,</b> mean number of AgNORs per nucleus and c-erB- 2 oncoprotein expression may be merited as good indicators to detect the inverted papilloma with more proliferative and aggressive lesions, and with the potential of malignant transformation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} expression of autophagy-related proteins in Hürthle cell neoplasm (HCN) and follicular neoplasm (FN) {{and assess the}} clinical implications. Methods. 265 FNs (112 follicular carcinomas and 153 follicular adenomas) and 108 HCNs (27 Hürthle cell carcinomas and 81 Hürthle cell adenomas) were made into a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot for autophagy-related proteins (beclin- 1, light chain (LC) 3 A, LC 3 B, p 62, and BNIP 3) were performed, {{and the results were}} statistically analyzed. Results. A higher <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of beclin- 1, LC 3 B, p 62, and BNIP 3 was found in HCN than in FN (P< 0. 001). The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of beclin- 1, LC 3 B, p 62, and BNIP 3 was the highest in HCCs followed by HCAs, FCs, and FAs in that order (P< 0. 001). HCCs were positive for the largest number of autophagy-related proteins followed by HCAs, FCs, and FAs (P< 0. 001), and most of the positive markers identified in HCCs were the high autophagy type (P< 0. 001), defined by positive staining for three or more of the five autophagy-related proteins.

40|$|We studied {{lymphocyte}} subsets, PHA-induced blastogenic {{rates of}} lymphocytes and Le^Y <b>expression</b> <b>rates</b> {{of them in}} 32 cases including 17 preoperative patients of gastric cancer, 8 healthy adults and 7 terminal patients of gastric cancer. In 17 patients who had underwent gastrectomy the relationship between histologic findings of cancer and lymphocyte in blood was examined. The PHA-induced blastogenic rates of lymphocytes were reduced in both operated and terminal stage groups. As regard to the change of lymphocyte subsets, the number of CD 4 ^ lymphocytes were normal range with no relation about the depths of invastion of gastric cancer. However, CD 8 ^ lymphocytes increased with the depth of invasion from mucosa to subserosa and CD 19 ^ lymphocytes decreased with the depth of invasion from mucosa to muscularis propria. These changes in lymphocyte subsets {{were thought to be}} the results of depressed immune potency from early stages of gastric cancer. The Le^Y <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of lymphocytes did not depend on the depth of invasion of cancer cells in the operate group, but was significantly higher in the cancer-bearing state of gastric cancer and terminal stage patient. In the many cases of higher Le^Y <b>expression</b> <b>rates</b> of lymphocytes, blastogenic rates of them were low.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{cellular}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} initiating or limiting the tumors including skin types are of great importance. The p 53 is a tumor-inhibiting gene which {{is believed to}} be defective in many malignant situations. Ki 67 is a non-histonic protein which is mainly interfere with the proliferation and has many controlling effects during the cell cycle. Because of their importance in skin tumor cell growth, this study aimed at evaluating the p 53 and Ki 67 expression in skin epithelial tumors by immunohistochemical method. Materials and Methods: In a descriptive setting, 50 biopsy samples (30 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 8 keratoacanthomas (KAs), and 2 trichoepitheliomas (TEs)) were immunohistochemically evaluated for p 53 and Ki 67 expression during a 14 -month period. The incidence and <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of these two variables were separately reported in each group of samples. Results: The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of p 53 was 67. 77 % for the BCCs, 50. 20 % for the SCCs, and null for the KAs. For both TEs, it was 50 %. The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of Ki 67 was 57. 33 % for the BCCs, 47. 70 % for the SCCs, 37. 5 % for the KAs, and 0. 0 % for TEs. The incidence of P 53 + cells was 100 % and 90 % in the BCC and SCC samples, respectively. The both TEs were positive in this regard. The incidence of Ki 67 + cells was 100 % for the BCC, SCC, and KA samples. The both TEs were negative in this regard. Conclusion: This study showed that the incidence rate of p 53 - and Ki 67 -positive cells is very high in skin malignant epithelial tumors. The <b>expression</b> <b>rate</b> of these two variables is comparable with reports in the literature. Further studies with large sample size are recommended to be carried out for KA and TE samples...|$|R
