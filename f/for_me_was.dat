25|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison, Ngũgĩ {{continued}} to write and produce activist literature and theatre, and he remained critical {{of the situation in}} Kenya. Another play Ngũgĩ had helped write, Maitũ Njugĩna (Mother, Sing <b>for</b> <b>Me),</b> <b>was</b> suppressed by the government. Due to his writing about the injustices of the dictatorial government, Ngũgĩ and his family received threats of violence and death, and were forced to live in exile. Ngũgĩ lived out his exile in the United Kingdom (1982–1989), and in the United States (1989–2002). While he was in exile, the Kenyan regime continued to harass him, and attempted to get him expelled from England. The regime also continued to repress his literature in Kenya; from 1986–1996, Matigari could not be sold in Kenya, and the regime removed all of Ngũgĩ's work from all educational institutions. Only after Arap Moi was voted out of office, 22 years later, was it safe for him and his family to return.|$|E

Drums take on a {{different}} role in a three-piece band, {{so it was a}} lot of fun. [...] Radio City was really more spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Sabbath {{embarked}} on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, {{and was replaced by}} former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. [...] "The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters..." [...] Iommi told Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. [...] "That, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{bisexual}} woman, Gaga actively supports LGBT rights worldwide. She attributes much of {{her early}} success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered a gay icon. Early in her career she had difficulty getting radio airplay, and stated, [...] "The turning point <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> the gay community." [...] She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based LGBT marketing company with whom her label Interscope works, in the liner notes of The Fame. One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network Logo.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's fourth {{starring}} role in a Hollywood film was in Kiss Them for Me (1957), for which she received prominent billing alongside Cary Grant. However, in the film itself she {{is little more than}} comic relief; Grant's character prefers a sleek, demure redhead played by fashion model Suzy Parker. Kiss Them <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> described as [...] "vapid" [...] and [...] "ill-advised", and was a critical and box office flop. The film was Mansfield's final {{starring role}} in a mainstream Hollywood studio film. It also marked one of the last attempts by 20th Century-Fox to publicize her.|$|E
500|$|One of Zoe's {{first and}} main storylines was being stalked by fellow student Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth).

Like I said, {{it was a bit}} weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E

500|$|Bergkamp {{attracted}} the attention of several European clubs {{as a result of his}} performances for Ajax. Johan Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him. But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy. He considered Serie A [...] "the biggest league at the time" [...] and preferred a move to either Juventus or Internazionale. On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk. Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter [...] "met all my demands. The most important thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{attended}} Diamond Bar High School, {{where she}} was a three-time all-league pick and was named All-American by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). At the school, she was known for her speed and sprinting ability. Morgan played for Olympic Development Program (ODP) regional and state teams as well. She later credited the program {{as an integral part}} of her development as a soccer player: [...] "... programs like ODP helped me especially because I did come into the club scene late and it was important for me to play as much as possible, play with the best players and learn from the best coaches. That, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> crucial to my development." ...|$|E
500|$|Hertzler {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he based his character on the role played by Morgan Freeman in the film The Shawshank Redemption (1994). He said that [...] "Freeman plays a lifer.

[...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet. I didn't get any of that. I was in a skintight rubber suit. Had I been 23, I would have been much happier, but at 49?" ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the game}} is based on Greek mythology, the {{development}} team gave themselves [...] "lots of freedom" [...] to modify the myths, and Jaffe said they took the [...] "coolest aspects of the subject" [...] and wrote a story using those elements. In an interview for Eurogamer, he said while the idea for God of War was his own, the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said [...] "let's do that with Greek Mythology". He was inspired {{in part by the}} 1981 feature film, Clash of the Titans, saying, [...] "the real high concept <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> ... merging it with Heavy Metal magazine". He said he liked both [...] "the kids stuff... with Greek Mythology" [...] and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence.|$|E
500|$|Berry told {{interviewer}} Kimberly Grant, [...] "The {{hard part}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> {{to try to}} stay connected to Phillips and Welson." [...] This was because, Grant writes, [...] "she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor." [...] Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut, Berry told Grant {{that it was difficult}} being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: [...] "That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level , so that I would be on the same level as they [...] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character." ...|$|E
500|$|Concept artist Tully Summers {{commented on}} Nolan's style of {{cinematography}} {{when asked about}} the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: [...] "The difference <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> Christopher Nolan's visual style. One {{of the things that makes}} his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film." ...|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on Arsenal's defeat, Wenger {{felt that}} [...] " [...] {{is not too}} important. We have won four Community Shields and no-one regards it as a trophy so I do not mind anymore." [...] He felt Chelsea's game plan was [...] "very direct" [...] and {{admitted}} Drogba gave his team [...] "a hard time on the long balls". Wenger absolved Senderos of any blame for the two goals – [...] "it would be unfair" [...] – and believed Fàbregas showed why he was a capable replacement for Patrick Vieira, who left in the summer: [...] "He controlled the game and <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> outstanding." [...] When {{asked if he was}} worried about Chelsea, Wenger retorted: [...] "Did you see the game today? You can be worried if you are a Chelsea supporter," [...] an indirect reference to their style of football.|$|E
500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night.

In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> to die." ...|$|E

500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> made at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|Cannon {{was awarded}} the Heisman Trophy as the nation's most {{outstanding}} player in 1959. He had 598 rushing yards, and although he scored only six touchdowns in total, his performance on Halloween night and his defensive play throughout the season was enough to convince voters. [...] "The thing that clinched the Heisman <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> that I made a play or two in a big game", he later explained. He received the award from Vice President Richard Nixon during a ceremony on December 9 at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. Cannon was the second player from the SEC to win the trophy, following Georgia's Frank Sinkwich in 1942. He received {{more than five times}} as many first-place votes as the runner-up. Cannon was also a repeat winner of nearly every award he won the previous season, including unanimous All-America recognition. Shortly after the 1959 season, the LSU football team retired Cannon's number 20 jersey. It was the only jersey retired by the team until Tommy Casanova's was also retired in 2009.|$|E
