The brothers built a factory in Concord, New Hampshire, to manufacture wagon wheels, wheel components, bodies and running gear. In 1872, at age 23, Benjamin was given an interest in his father's business, and he assumed more responsibility for the company's operations. W.Harrison Holt moved to Tiffin, Ohio, to manage the company's lumber business there, where he remained until the early 1880s. Their mother died in 1875, and their father died eight years later in 1883. After his father's death, Benjamin Holt left New Hampshire in 1883 to help Charles build the business in California.|$|E

The efficacy of methyl iodide (MeI) and sulfuryl fluoride (SF) for eradicating wood-inhabiting fungus, Ceratocystis fagacearum was assessed in wood blocks of birch, maple, poplar and red pine based on in-vitro experiments. In {{a series of}} replicated controlled experiments, wood blocks were inoculated with a 1 g macerated mycelium/spores mixture of C. fagacearum and fumigated with 160 and 240 g/m 3 of MeI, SF and methyl bromide (MeBr) as control) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Analysis of variance showed that fumigant types, fumigant concentrations, and exposure {{time as well as}} their interactions (C x T) had an effect on C. fagacearum recovery on tested wood species. Colonization of birch, maple, red pine, and poplar by C. fagacearum was significantly greater in non-fumigated samples than fumigated samples. C. fagacearum was greatly inhibited by MeI than SF in all wood species tested. Overall, the C x T products of ≤ 4. 108 g-h/m 3 for MeI and ≤ 8. 755 g-h/m 3 for SF were not effective in killing the fungus. These results suggest that longer treatment exposure time might achieve the goal of complete eradication of C. fagacearum and imply that MeI performed as well as MeBr in killing the fungus in some wood species by exposure time combination. Overall, MeI was most effective in killing the fungus than SF under the conditions of this study with potential implications for quarantine use...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the interrelationship between three nondestructive methods {{to predict the}} stiffness of a tropical <b>hardwood</b> (Sextonia rubra). <b>Lumber</b> material from Sextonia rubra was collected, ripped and planned and boards were then nondestructively tested using three methods: stress wave, transverse vibration and static bending. Stress wave (Edsw) and transverse vibration (Edtv) testing were done using commercial equipment while the static bending testing (Esb) was conducted according to the ASTM D 4761. According to the results, linear regression models could be fitted to explain the interrelationship between the nondestructive properties. The best model was observed {{for the relationship between}} Esb and Edtv (R 2 = 0. 946), followed by Esb/Edsw (R 2 = 0. 834) and Edtv/Edsw (R 2 = 0. 817). The values of dynamic modulus of elasticity were frequently higher (Edsw= 4. 19 %; Edtv= 9. 44 %) than the Esb values (15314 N/mm 2). On the other hand, Edtv values were higher (5. 35 %) than Edsw values. It can be concluded that the three nondestructive testing methods studied are suitable to estimate the stiffness of this tropical hardwood. However, corrected models must be employed to improve the reliability of the predicted values...|$|R

Data from conifer seed orchards and natural and managed stands of hardwood trees have {{shed light on the}} distance over which pollen can move, and underscore the need for managerial attention to seed orchard design, placement, and maintenance. We used eleven microsatellite markers to investigate pollen gene flow, female mate choice, and male reproductive success in a clonal seed orchard of northern red oak based on paternity analysis of seed orchard offspring in progeny tests. Nearly all (93 %) offspring were sired by a male parent within the seed orchard. The mean number of male parents per year was 69. 5, or 47. 6 % of all clones in the seed orchard. Female clones in the early phenology group had more offspring sired from extra-orchard pollen (13 %) than clones in the intermediate (5 %) and late (1 %) phenology groups. Distance was the largest influence on pollination success, and pollination occurred most often by male trees in the same subline as the maternal tree. Males in the early phenology group sired more offspring overall in the progeny pool and more offspring per mother tree than males in the intermediate or late phenology groups. Average genetic correlations among all OP progeny ranged between 0. 2557 and 0. 3529 with a mean of 0. 28 ± 0. 01. The importance of progeny test genotyping for northern red oak improvement likely is increasing with the demand for improved varieties.
