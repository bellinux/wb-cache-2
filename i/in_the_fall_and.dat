5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, Jourdan's army withdrew again {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine. After his {{disastrous}} panic at Diez, Jean Castelbert de Castelverd held east bank entrenchments at Neuwied, Poncet crossed at Bonn while the other divisions retired behind the Sieg. Jourdan handed over command to Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville, on 22 September. Charles left 32,000 to 36,000 troops in the north, 9,000 more in Mainz and Mannheim and moved south with 16,000 to help intercept Moreau. Franz von Werneck was placed in charge of the northern force. Though Beurnonville's army grew to 80,000 men, he remained completely passive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> winter of 1796. The disgraced Castelverd was later replaced by Jacques Desjardin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} {{calls for the}} mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call. The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another difference is that chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> the chats are used by either sex when disturbed. The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males.|$|E
5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. It {{would also have to}} compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E

During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away {{from the field and}} beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E
