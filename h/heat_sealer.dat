40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{feasibility}} of performing a cohort study on health risks from occupational exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) in Germany. Methods A set of criteria was developed to evaluate the feasibility of such a cohort study. The criteria aimed at conditions of exposure and exposure assessment (level, duration, preferably on an individual basis), the possibility to assemble a cohort and the feasibility of ascertaining various disease endpoints. Results Twenty occupational settings with workers potentially exposed to RF-EMF and, in addition, a cohort of amateur radio operators were considered. Based on expert ratings, literature reviews and our set of predefined criteria, three of the cohorts were identified as promising for further evaluation: the personnel (technicians) of medium/short wave broadcasting stations, amateur radio operators, and workers on dielectric <b>heat</b> <b>sealers.</b> After further analyses, the cohort of workers on dielectric <b>heat</b> <b>sealers</b> seems not to be feasible due to the small number of exposed workers available and to the difficulty of assessing exposure (exposure depends heavily on the respective working process and mixture of exposures, e. g. plastic vapours), although exposure was highest in this occupational setting. The advantage of the cohort of amateur radio operators was the large number of persons it includes, while the advantage of the cohort of personnel working at broadcasting stations was the quality of retrospective exposure assessment. However, in the cohort of amateur radio operators the exposure assessment was limited, and the cohort of technicians was hampered by the small number of persons working in this profession. Conclusion The majority of occupational groups exposed to RF-EMF are not practicable for setting up an occupational cohort study due to the small numbers of exposed subjects or due to exposure levels being only marginally higher than those of the general public. </p...|$|R

50|$|Heat sealing is {{the process}} of sealing one {{thermoplastic}} to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure. The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives and film or foil sealing.Common applications for the heat sealing process: Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where heat staking or ultrasonic welding is not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations. Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Medical and the Food Industries manufacturing Bag or flexible containers use heat sealing for either perimeter welding of the plastic material of the bags and/or for sealing ports and tubes into the bags.A variety of <b>heat</b> <b>sealers</b> are available to join thermoplastic materials such as plastic films: Hot bar sealer, Impulse sealer, etc.|$|R
40|$|Self-degradable slag/Class F fly ash blend {{pozzolana}} cements were formulated, {{assuming that}} they might serve well as alternative temporary fracture sealers in Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) wells operating at temperatures of {ge} 200 C. Two candidate formulas were screened based upon material criteria including an initial setting time {ge} 60 min at 85 C, compressive strength {ge} 2000 psi for a 200 C autoclaved specimen, {{and the extent of}} self-degradation of cement heated at {ge} 200 C for it was contacted with water. The first screened dry mix formula consisted of 76. 5 wt% slag- 19. 0 wt% Class F fly ash- 3. 8 wt% sodium silicate as alkali activator, and 0. 7 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the self-degradation promoting additive, and second formula comprised of 57. 3 wt% slag, 38. 2 wt% Class F fly ash, 3. 8 wt% sodium silicate, and 0. 7 wt% CMC. After mixing with water and autoclaving it at 200 C, the aluminum-substituted 1. 1 nm tobermorite crystal phase was identified as hydrothermal reaction product responsible {{for the development of a}} compressive strength of 5983 psi. The 200 C-autoclaved cement made with the latter formula had the combined phases of tobermorite as its major reaction product and amorphous geopolymer as its minor one providing a compressive strength of 5271 psi. Sodium hydroxide derived from the hydrolysis of sodium silicate activator not only initiated the pozzolanic reaction of slag and fly ash, but also played an important role in generating in-situ exothermic heat that significantly contributed to promoting self-degradation of cementitious sealers. The source of this exothermic heat was the interactions between sodium hydroxide, and gaseous CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 3 }COOH by-products generated from thermal decomposition of CMC at {ge} 200 C in an aqueous medium. Thus, the magnitude of this self-degradation depended on the exothermic temperature evolved in the sealer; a higher temperature led to a sever disintegration of sealer. The exothermic temperature was controlled by the extent of thermal decomposition of CMC, demonstrating that CMC decomposed at higher temperature emitted more gaseous reactants. Hence, such large emission enhanced the evolution of in-situ exothermic heat. In contrast, the excessive formation of geopolymer phase due to more incorporation of Class F fly ash into this cementitious system affected its ability to self-degrade, reflecting that there was no self-degradation. The geopolymer was formed by hydrothermal reactions between sodium hydroxide from sodium silicate and mullite in Class F fly ash. Thus, the major reason why geopolymer-based cementitiuos sealers did not degrade after <b>heated</b> <b>sealers</b> came in contact with water was their lack of free sodium hydroxide...|$|R

40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of laminated films with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory <b>heat</b> <b>sealer</b> was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process. Laminated films made from extrusion lamination process provided lower level of achievable heat seal strength when compared with the laminated films made from dry-bond lamination proces...|$|E

Biodegradable high-density polyethylene (BHDPE) and polypropylene (BPP) films were tested. Commercial bags of pre-cut Romaine sealed in a polyethylene/oriented polypropylene (PE/OPP) bag formed on a WFS machine were used as the control.

Leaks were found when bags were vacuum tested to 14 in Hg absolute for 15 seconds. However, a 45. 5 % fail rate was also observed for commercial bags made using the same VFFS machine, suggesting similar seal concerns for current industry film structures. Though an attempt was made to only store bags that were sealed properly, bags made from the biodegradable films sealed with the thermal-bar did not perform as well as the commercial packages and the shelf-life of the pre-cut Romaine was shortened. When biodegradable bags were sealed using a bar impulse sealer, hermetic seals were obtained. The Romaine stored in these bags had a similar rate of decay and level of pinking after 14 days storage as Romaine packaged in the commercial PE/OPP bags. These results indicate that the use of commercial impulse sealers, rather than thermal-bar heat sealers, would allow industry to utilize these biodegradable films for pre-cut lettuce mixes...|$|E
