5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> experiencing acute attacks, <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> who have the progressive subtypes, <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{provides}} good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies {{with up to}} 5 years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms local control, and is comparable to EBRT.

5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: There aren’t any {{objective}} {{methods that}} may help in standard evaluation of oral surgery patient’s psycho-emotional status. Without any standardized evaluation, two main problems appear: heterogeneity between studies and ineffective patient’s evaluation. Therefore, Universal Scale in Oral Surgery (USOS) <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating has previously been proposed by authors. The aim of present study is to assess the clinical effectivity and validate the Universal Scale in Oral Surgery in case of outpatient tooth extraction <b>for</b> adult healthy <b>patients.</b> Material and Methods: Clinical trial to validate the USOS <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating was performed. In total 90 <b>patients,</b> that came <b>for</b> outpatient dental extraction to Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department ambulatory, were enrolled in clinical trial. Patients filled self-reported questionnaires before the procedure. Operating surgeon rated USOS <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating doctor’s part questionnaire after the procedure. 4 - 6 weeks later all patients were asked to fill USOS <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating questionnaire retrospectively. Results: According to the statistical analysis, the final composition of USOS <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating that would fit to reliability coefficient should be composed from 6 patient part questions and 3 general doctor part questions. Conclusions: Universal Scale in Oral Surgery <b>for</b> <b>patient’s</b> psycho-emotional status rating is a novel, doctor and patient rated scale which is suitable for clinical and scientific usage...|$|R

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. <b>For</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support.
