5000|$|Most modern {{keyboards}} do {{not have}} a dedicated key to input the <b>Delete</b> <b>character.</b> In Unix-like systems the [...] key or combination of [...] and [...] can be used to express the <b>Delete</b> <b>character.</b> Products like Notepad may also generate this character with the same key presses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>delete</b> <b>character</b> is {{strictly}} a control character, not a graphic character. This is true {{not only in}} ISO 646, but also in all related standards including Unicode. However, many modern character sets deviate from ISO 646, {{and as a result}} a graphic character might occupy the position originally reserved for the <b>delete</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In computing, the <b>delete</b> <b>{{character}}</b> (sometimes {{also called}} rubout) {{is the last}} character in the ASCII repertoire, with the code 127 (decimal). Not a graphic character but a control character, it is denoted as [...] in caret notation and has a graphic representation of &#x2421; in Unicode (as all ASCII control characters have graphic representations).|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} of the {{differences}} between MUMPS and MIIS, the value of a logical expression in MUMPS may be false = zero (0) or true = non-zero, canonically, one (1).

50|$|The {{software}} {{was the first}} commercially available word processor for the Apple III and featured formatting commands such as margin settings, centering, justification, bold, underlined, subscript, superscripts, doublestrike, titles, footnotes, and page numbers. The program was also {{able to use the}} Apple III redefinable keyboard to provide single-stroke editor commands (such as find, <b>delete</b> <b>character,</b> delete line, and so forth).|$|E
5000|$|This {{code was}} {{originally}} used to mark deleted characters on punched tape, since any character could {{be changed to}} all ones by punching holes everywhere. If a character was punched erroneously, punching out all seven bits caused this position to be ignored or deleted, a computer version of correction fluid. In hexadecimal, this is 7F to rubout 7 bits, and FF to rubout 8 bits. For teleprinters like the Teletype Model 33, lines were commonly ended by the three characters CR, LF, and rubout, with the rubout allowing time for the print mechanism to physically move to the left margin. On VT100 compatible terminals, this is the character generated by the key labeled Delete, which transmits a <b>delete</b> <b>character</b> (octal 177, hexadecimal 7F) to the host system. On VT510 compatible terminals, this is the character generated by the key labeled ?, usually called backspace on modern machines, and does not correspond to the PC [...] "Delete" [...] key.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, for simpler operations, {{specialized}} Unix utilities such as grep (print lines matching a pattern), head (print {{the first}} part of a file), tail (print the last part of a file), and tr (translate or <b>delete</b> <b>characters)</b> are often preferable. For the specific tasks they are designed to carry out, such specialized utilities are usually simpler, clearer, and faster than a more general solution such as sed.|$|R
5000|$|Since ISO/IEC 2022 is a {{stateful}} encoding, {{a program}} cannot {{jump in the}} middle of a block of text to search, insert or <b>delete</b> <b>characters.</b> This makes manipulation of the text very cumbersome and slow when compared to non-stateful encodings. Any jump {{in the middle of}} the text may require a back up to the previous escape sequence before the bytes following the escape sequence can be interpreted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} Arc-Preserving Subsequence (APS) prob-lem with {{unlimited}} annotations. Given two arc-annotated sequences P and T, this problem asks {{if it is}} possible to <b>delete</b> <b>characters</b> from T to obtain P. Since even the unary version of APS is NP-hard, we used the framework of parameterized complexity, focusing on a parameterization of this problem where the parameter is the number of deletions we can make. We present a linear-time FPT algorithm for a generalization of APS, applying techniques originally designed to give an FPT algorithm for Induced Subgraph Isomorphism on interval graphs [12]. ...|$|R
50|$|This table {{compares the}} {{algorithmic}} traits of string and rope implementations, not their raw speed. Array-based strings have smaller overhead, so (for example) concatenation and split operations are faster on small datasets. However, when array-based strings {{are used for}} longer strings, time complexity and memory use for inserting and <b>deleting</b> <b>characters</b> become unacceptably large. In contrast, a rope data structure has stable performance regardless of data size. Further, the space complexity for ropes and arrays are both O(n). In summary, ropes are preferable when the data is large and modified often.|$|R

After executing O1, the document becomes [...] "xabc". To execute O2 after O1, O2 must be transformed against O1 to become: O2' = Delete, whose positional parameter is incremented by one due to the insertion of one character [...] "x" [...] by O1. Executing O2' on [...] "xabc" [...] <b>deletes</b> the correct <b>character</b> [...] "c" [...] and the document becomes [...] "xab". However, if O2 is executed without transformation, it incorrectly <b>deletes</b> <b>character</b> [...] "b" [...] rather than [...] "c". The basic idea of OT is to transform (or adjust) the parameters of an editing operation according to the effects of previously executed concurrent operations so that the transformed operation can achieve the correct effect and maintain document consistency.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{processor}} used {{was only a}} slight adaptation from that used on HP minicomputers, the system software would be completely redesigned for a computer with its operating system and language system built into read-only memory. BASIC was similar to FORTRAN used by engineers on the HP 1000 minicomputer, but much simpler to use as an interpreted language. Arrow cursor keys were provided which could scroll up and down lines, and interactively insert or <b>delete</b> <b>characters</b> which was unheard of with most CRT or printing terminals until {{the advent of the}} screen editor in the late 1970s, and the programmer could single-step or check values of variables.|$|R
40|$|In this {{extended}} abstract, {{we describe}} {{a method for}} language model-assisted text en-try in an AAC (Alternative and Augmentative Communication) environment. We outline an algorithm for determining the optimal actions for a binary typing {{system in which the}} user is queried one character at a time. The goal of such a system is to maximize keystroke sav-ings by automatically typing highly-probable <b>characters</b> and automatically <b>deleting</b> improb-able <b>characters.</b> This algorithm is robust to uncertainty in user input, uses all past input to determine its next action, and allows the user to <b>delete</b> incorrect <b>characters.</b> We de-scribe simulations that will be done, and dis-cuss potential trade-offs between theoretically optimal performance and the overall user ex-perience. ...|$|R

2500|$|A third {{issue is}} the {{involvement}} of the world's developer or maintenance staff in such transactions. [...] Since a developer may change the virtual world any time, ban a player, delete items, or even simply take the world down never to return, the issue of their responsibility in the case where real money investments are lost through items being lost or becoming inaccessible is significant. [...] Richard Bartle argued that this aspect negates the whole idea of ownership in virtual worlds, and thus in the absence of real ownership no real trade may occur. [...] Some developers have acted deliberately to delete items that have been traded for money, as in Final Fantasy XI, where a task force was set up to <b>delete</b> <b>characters</b> involved in selling in-game currency for real-world money.|$|R
