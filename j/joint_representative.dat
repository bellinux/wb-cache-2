In that goal, a test programme was first performed, including, on one hand, tests on Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Notch Flexure (ENF) specimens, and, on the other hand, on Skin-Doubler specimens. In a second step, the study then aimed at assessing a modelling method involving cohesive elements techniques, by first simulating the DCB and ENF specimens in order to evaluate the model in pure mode loading, and then the Skin-Doubler specimens for final assessment in mixed mode loading...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} carried out to analyse the potentialities of a technique based {{on the use of}} multidirectional CFRP laminates (MDL-CFRP) for the seismic repair and strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column joints. This experimental program comprises cyclic tests on three full-scale RC <b>joints,</b> <b>representative</b> of interior beam-column connections in buildings. The joints were initially submitted to a cyclic test inducing a damage pattern representative of a seismic event. Subsequently, they were repaired and strengthened with MDL-CFRP. The strengthened joints were then tested for the same loading history of the original ones up to their failure. The adopted strengthening technique uses the MDL-CFRP that are simultaneously glued and anchored to the concrete surfaces. This technique is called Mechanically Fastened and Externally Bonded Reinforcement (MF-EBR). In the present study, the effectiveness of two different strengthening configurations was investigated. The tests are described and the main results are presented and analyzed...|$|R
