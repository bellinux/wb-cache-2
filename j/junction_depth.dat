40|$|Conventional {{scaling of}} gate oxide thickness, source/drain {{extension}} (SDE), <b>junction</b> <b>depths,</b> and gate lengths have enabled MOS gate dimensions {{to be reduced}} from 10 m in the 1970 's to a present day size of 0. 1 m. To enable transistor scaling into the 21 st century, new solutions such as high dielectric constant materials for gate insulation and shallow, ultra low resistivity junctions need to be developed. In this paper, for the first time, key scaling limits are quantified for MOS transistors (see Table 1). We show that traditional SiO 2 gate dielectrics will reach fundamental leakage limits, due to tunneling, for an effective electrical thickness below 2. 3 nm. Experimental data and simulations are used to show that although conventional scaling of <b>junction</b> <b>depths</b> is still possible, increased resistance for <b>junction</b> <b>depths</b> below 30 nm results in performance degradation. Because of these limits, {{it will not be}} possible to further improve short channel effects. This will result in either unacceptable off-state leakage currents or strongly degraded device performance for gate lengths below 0. 10 m. MOS transistor limits will be reached for 0. 13 m process technologies in production during 2002. Because of these problems, new solutions will need to be developed for continued transistor scaling.

40|$|The ITRS Roadmap {{highlights}} the electrical {{characterization of the}} source and drain extension regions as a key challenge for future complimentary-metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Presently, an accurate determination of the <b>depth</b> of ultrashallow <b>junctions</b> can routinely only be performed by time-consuming and destructive techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In this work, the authors propose to use the fast and nondestructive photomodulated optical reflectance (PMOR) technique, as implemented in the Therma-Probe (TP) dopant metrology system, for these purposes. PMOR is a pump-probe technique based on the measurement of the pump-induced modulated change in probe reflectance, i. e., the so-called (photo) modulated reflectance. In this article, the authors demonstrate that the absolute <b>junction</b> <b>depths</b> of boxlike active dopant structures can be extracted in a very simple and straightforward way from the TP offset curves, which represent {{the behavior of the}} modulated reflectance {{as a function of the}} pump-probe beam spacing. Although the procedure is based on the insights into the physical behavior of the offset curves, no modeling is involved in the actual extraction process itself. The extracted <b>junction</b> <b>depths</b> are in good correlation with the corresponding <b>junction</b> <b>depths</b> as measured by means of SIMS.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pillar height and <b>junction</b> <b>depth</b> on solar cell {{characteristics}} are investigated to provide design rules for arrays of such pillars in solar energy applications. Radially doped silicon pillar arrays are fabricated by deep {{reactive ion etching}} of silicon substrates followed {{by the introduction of}} dopant atoms by diffusion from a phosphorus oxide layer conformally deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Increasing the height of the pillars has led to doubling of the efficiency from 6 % for flat substrates to 12 % for 40 μm high pillars with a 900 nm <b>junction</b> <b>depth</b> because of an increase in the total junction area and lower optical reflection. For higher pillars, the current density and efficiency is decreased, which is attributed to the increasing presence of defect states at the surface introduced during the etching process.

Si wafers enabled by the molecular monolayer doping of phosphorus and boron atoms {{and the use of}} conventional spike annealing. The junctions are characterized by secondary ion mass spectrometry and noncontact sheet resistance measurements. It is found that the majority (∼ 70 %) of the incorporated dopants are electrically active, therefore enabling a low sheet resistance for a given dopant areal dose. The wafer-scale uniformity is investigated and found to be limited by the temperature homogeneity of the spike anneal tool used in the experiments. Notably, minimal junction leakage currents (< 1 µA/cm 2) are observed that highlights the quality of the junctions formed by this process. The results clearly demonstrate the versatility and potency of the monolayer doping approach for enabling controlled, molecular-scale ultrashallow junction formation without introducing defects in the semiconductor.
