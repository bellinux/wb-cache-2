30|$|As noted previously, {{the gender}} <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> {{concentration}} of unemployment {{is as important}} as the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> unemployment rate. Yet few studies have addressed the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> concentration of unemployment (Bazen et al. (2013)). One purpose of the present study is to fill this gap. However, we are interested in not only measuring the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> concentration of unemployment, but also to explaining this gap. For this purpose, the next two sections of the paper present an econometric analysis of the sources of the gap.|$|R

5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E

During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} two important and related {{dimensions of the}} persisting gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) bachelor degrees: First, the life-course timing of a stable gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> STEM orientation, and second, variations <b>in</b> the gender <b>gap</b> across high schools. We build on existing psychological and sociological gender theories to develop a theoretical argument {{about the development of}} STEM orientations during adolescence and the potential influence of the local high school environment on the formation of STEM orientations by females and males. Using the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), we then decompose the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> STEM bachelor degrees and show that the solidification of the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> STEM orientations is largely a process that occurs during the high school years. Far from being a fixed attribute of adolescent development, however, we find that the size of the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> STEM orientation is quite sensitive to local high school influences; going to school at a high school that is supportive of a positive orientation by females towards math and science can reduce the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> STEM bachelor degrees by 25 % or more...|$|R

Furthermore, we examine to what extent medicalisation attitudes explain the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> professional health care use. Using data from the second wave of the European Social Survey (N = 42028), we find that women report more positive attitudes towards medicalisation than men, explaining {{a small part of}} the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> professional health care use. No association was observed between gender stratification and the gender <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> medicalisation attitudes or health care use. However, respondents living in societies characterized by a lower level of gender stratification, position themselves more independently towards physicians, while they use professional health care more frequently. status: publishe...|$|R
