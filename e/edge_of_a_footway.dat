50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s All Saints faced {{a very real}} threat of closure but survived the axe which sadly meant {{the closure of the}} {{neighbouring}} primary school in the village of Shimpling. All Saints was extended and a small playing field was provided {{at the rear of the}} school. Another significant improvement for school users was the provision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>footway</b> in the early 1990s from Lambs Lane to The Street. This enabled children to walk to school from Harrow Green and Lambs Lane in safety.|$|R

30|$|In various {{fields such}} as {{marketing}} research, traffic control, and safety management, there is a demand for methods for estimating the number of pedestrians. For example, information on the temporal change in traffic volume <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>footway</b> {{can be used to}} determine the appropriate time for construction or maintenance (Leutzbach 1987). In addition, {{based on the number of}} pedestrians with information on their movement direction (i.e., the number of people entering and exiting) at the entrances of commercial facilities, event sites, or food courts, it is possible to prevent crowding. Although manual counting is often used for monitoring the number of pedestrians, it entails high labor cost and cannot be used in crowded environments. Therefore, automatic methods for estimating the number of pedestrians have attracted considerable attention (Dharmaraju et al. 2002; Bu et al. 2007; Greene-Roesel et al. 2008; Leykin and Hammoud 2006; Goubet et al. 2006; Hashimoto et al. 1998; Fod et al. 2002; Cui et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2008; Heeikkilä M and Pietikäinen 2006; Zhao and Wu 2008; Eshel and Moses 2008).|$|R
