5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and {{salinization}} affecting {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> afield in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in San Francisco Bay. Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} Corte Madera Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{launched}} {{an assault on}} Sparta and took the walls, but their advance was initially impeded by the narrowness of the roads in the city's outskirts. However, the streets grew wider as they advanced into the city's center, and the Spartans were forced <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> back. Nabis, seeing his defenses collapsing, tried to flee, but Pythagoras rallied the soldiers and ordered them to {{set fire to the}} buildings closest to the walls. Burning debris was thrown on the coalition's soldiers entering the city, causing many casualties. Observing this, Flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base. When the attack was renewed later, the Spartans managed to hold off the Roman assaults for three days before Nabis, seeing that the situation was hopeless, decided to send Pythagoras with an offer of surrender. At first, Flaminius refused to see him, but when Pythagoras came to the Roman camp a second time Flamininus accepted the surrender, with the conditions of the treaty being the same as Flamininus had previously proposed. The treaty was later ratified by the Senate.|$|E

25|$|As well as this, Europeans {{began to}} venture <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> east (most notably, perhaps, Marco Polo) {{as a result}} of the Pax Mongolica.

25|$|Demographic Model: This model {{suggests}} that Scandinavia experienced a population boom {{just before the}} Viking Age began. The agricultural capabilities of the land were not enough {{to keep up with}} the increasing population. As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually into all of Europe.|$|E

25|$|When {{analyzing}} these 12 lines, Sethna {{suggests that}} the lovely boy is becoming substantially older in years with out losing any beauty; in fact he is increasing with beauty: he has grown by waning, he has turned more boyishly lovely as the span of his life lessens <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further.</b> Sethna believes that the boy's lack of aging underscores Shakespeare's aging, and Shakespeare's aging highlight's nature's ability to ignore Time in the boy's case. This is emphasized by Nature's capacity to foil Time's destructiveness. Nonetheless, the capacity can only last so long.|$|E
25|$|The earlier halakha did not confine {{itself to}} the mere literal meaning of single passages, but sought to draw {{conclusions}} from {{the wording of the}} texts in question by logical deductions, by combinations with other passages, etc. Hence its midrash differs from the simple exegesis of the older halakha. It treats the Bible according to certain general principles, which in the course of time became more and more amplified and developed (see Talmud); and its interpretations depart <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> from the simple meaning of the words.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Sim, {{who was at}} {{the time}} a {{frequent}} marijuana user, began using LSD, taking the drug with such frequency that he was eventually hospitalized. It was this incident that Sim claims led to the inspiration to produce Cerebus for 300 monthly issues. The episodic adventures strayed <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> from heroic fantasy, and the twenty five-issue graphic novel High Society segued the narrative into a complex political satire and drama. With issue #65 Sim was joined by Gerhard; Gerhard's intricately rendered backgrounds became a visual hallmark of the comic.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that since the Viking Age, the Sami culture has been driven <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there are some folklore called stalo or tales, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by LÃ¦stadius to be histories of Vikings interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} {{inspired}} by the long-running Bathurst 1000 touring car race, which began at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit in Victoria in 1960 (before moving to Bathurst in 1963) as a race for standard production cars with minimal modifications. As the Bathurst 1000 evolved, the touring cars that raced in it moved <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> away from the minimal modifications of the original race. The Bathurst 12 Hour was intended to create the original feel of the Bathurst 1000, while providing a unique test in the longer race distance, rather than replicating the 1000 kilometre event.|$|E

25|$|At {{the outset}} of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, LÃ©ger, de La Fresnaye, and Duchamp-Villon. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to {{continue}} making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an evasion of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge <b>further</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> away from the depiction of things.
