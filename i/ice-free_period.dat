Martino Natural Park (Trento, Italy). The lakes were monitored and sampled monthly, during ten <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods,</b> from 1998 to 2007, to analyse water chemical and physical characteristics and to study diversity and abundance of diatoms. 78 taxa of Bacillariophyceae were found, among which Cyclotella spp., Tabellaria flocculosa and Fragilaria spp. predominated. Both chemical data and diatom community composition are consistent with wellbuffered mesotrophic lakes. Diatom dynamics resulted statistically related to water temperature variations...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} glacial {{modification}} in small catchments {{along the eastern}} Sierra Nevada, California, controls the timing and pattern of sediment flux to the adjacent fans. There is a close relationship between the depth of fan-head incision and the pattern and degree of Late Pleistocene catchment erosion by valley glaciers; catchments with significant glacial activity are associated with deeply incised fan heads, whereas fans emerging from glacially unmodified catchments are unincised. We suggest that the depth of fan-head incision {{is controlled by the}} potential for sediment storage during relatively dry <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods,</b> which in turn is related to the downstream length of the glacially modified valley and creation of accommodation through valley floor slope lowering and glacial valley overdeepening and widening. Significant storage in glacially modified basins during <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods</b> leads to sediment supply-limited conditions at the fan head and causes deep incision. In contrast, a lack of sediment trapping allows quasi-continuous sediment supply to the fan and prevents incision of the fan head. Sediment evacuation rates should thus show large variations in glacially modified basins, with major peaks during glacial and lows during interglacial or <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively. In contrast, sediment removal from glacially unmodified catchments in this type of setting should be free of this effect, and will be dominated instead by short-term variations, modulated for example by changes in vegetation cover or storm frequency. This distinction may help improve our understanding of long-term sediment yields as a measure of erosional efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sea ice {{across the}} Arctic is declining and {{altering}} physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) {{have been identified}} as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. Principal Findings: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods,</b> may become critical for polar bears {{before the end of the}} 21 st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2 – 5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods</b> that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. Conclusions/Significance: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100...|$|R

High-resolution analyses of marine sediment cores from the Iberian margin trace a number of associated changes simultaneously. Proxies of sea surface temperature and water mass distribution, as well as relative biomarker content, demonstrate that this typical north-south coupling was pervasive for the cold phases of climate during the past 420, 000 years.

40|$|Short {{summary of}} Quaternary glacial geology in MinnesotaThe Quaternary Period began about 2 million years ago. It {{is divided into}} the Pleistocene Epoch (2 million to 10, 000 years ago) and the Holocene Epoch (10, 000 years ago to present). Although 2 million years is a {{relatively}} short period of time geologically, sediments deposited during this time mask nearly all of Minnesota's previous geologic history (as old as 3600 million years!). The Pleistocene, also called the Ice Age, is the time when the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered much of northern North America. Minnesota was at the edge of the ice sheet, and thus was not always completely covered with ice. Instead, Minnesota experienced several episodes of glaciation followed by <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} has the {{potential}} to alter many facets of Earth's freshwater resources, especially lacustrine ecosystems. The effects of anthropogenic changes in Lake Superior, which is Earth's largest freshwater lake by area, are not well documented (spatially or temporally) and predicted future states in response to climate change vary. Here we show that Lake Superior experienced a slow, steady increase in production throughout the Holocene using (paleo) productivity proxies in lacustrine sediments to reconstruct past changes in primary production. Furthermore, data from the last century indicate a rapid increase in primary production, which we attribute to increasing surface water temperatures and longer seasonal stratification related to longer <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods</b> in Lake Superior due to anthropogenic climate warming. These observations demonstrate that anthropogenic effects have become a prominent influence on one of Earth's largest, most pristine lacustrine ecosystems...|$|R
50|$|The Cairngorms {{were formed}} 40 million {{years before the}} last ice age, when slight uplift raised an eroded {{peneplain}} based on an exposed granite pluton. The highest present-day peaks represent eroded monadnock hills. During the ice ages the ice caps that covered most of northern Scotland remained static, frozen to the ground for long periods and actually protected the rounded summits and valleys and deep weathered granite of the mountains of the area. Glacial erosion is represented in deep valleys which dissect the area. Many valleys are littered with glacial deposits from the period of glacial retreat. The most famous valley is the Lairig Ghru pass, a gouge through {{the centre of the}} mountains—a u-shaped valley, now partly filled with extensive scree produced by intense frost action during <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods.</b> Many parts of the Cairngorms exhibit classic periglacial weathering which occurred during cold <b>periods</b> in <b>ice-free</b> areas.|$|R

5000|$|The theory {{behind the}} name [...] "Lusitanian" [...] is now discredited; it posited {{that there was}} an {{ice-free}} land mass that served as a refugium off of the south-west of Ireland during the Quaternary (last) glaciation.

Although the theory is no longer accepted, the term Lusitanian is still used as a descriptive term for faunal elements such as the Kerry slug. Recently a better explanation of the occurrence of the Kerry slug and similar faunal elements in southwestern Ireland has been developed. This new theory is supported by two recent discoveries: the genetic similarity of much of Ireland’s fauna to that of northern Spain, and the genetic similarity of much of Ireland’s human population to that of northern Spain.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Food {{habits of}} polar bears on land during the <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> in western Hudson Bay were {{examined}} between 1986 and 1992. In contrast to previous studies, feeding on vegetation during the <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> was common. Between August and October, evidence of feeding {{was found in}} 34 % of the females and 26 % of the males captured over 10 km inland from the coast. The primary forage was Vaccinium uliginosum and Empetrum nigrum berries. Feeding was most common in subadults and females. The incidence of feeding on berries varied annually from 2 to 41 %. We {{were not able to}} determine the energetic importance of terrestrial foraging, but the intake may reduce the rate of weight loss of bears on land, particularly in years when berries are abundant...|$|E

Accurate forecasts of weather and sea ice are desirable for safe navigation, but large uncertainties exist in current forecasts, partly owing to the sparse observational network over the Arctic Ocean. Here, we show that the incorporation of additional Arctic observations improves the initial analysis and enhances the skill of weather and sea-ice forecasts, the application of which has socioeconomic benefits. Comparison of 63 -member ensemble atmospheric forecasts, using different initial data sets, revealed that additional Arctic radiosonde observations were useful for predicting a persistent strong wind event.

30|$|River {{discharge}} into the Arctic Ocean {{is a highly}} effective conveyor in transporting continental heat across Eurasia (Nghiem et al. 2014) under a warming climate with increasing temperatures (Fig.  2). Eurasian rivers with immense watersheds, particularly the Severnaya Dvina, Pechora, Ob, Yenisei, Lena, and Kolyma Rivers, provide a massive flux of warm waters into the Arctic Ocean or peripheral seas contributing to melt sea ice in spring and summer. The massive river energy flux to the Arctic Ocean carries an enormous heating power of 1.0 [*]×[*] 1019  J/year for each 1  °C of the warm river waters above freezing, which {{is equivalent to the}} power release from detonation of 2.5 [*]×[*] 109  TNT/°C/year (Nghiem et al. 2014). With increased water temperatures (Lammers et al. 2007) and longer <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods</b> of the Arctic rivers (Shiklomanov and Lammers 2014), the role of river heat input is increasing and must be incorporated in sea ice prediction and projection models. These changes of river discharge in Northern Eurasia have a predictive potential to force Arctic change at interannual to decadal timescales and beyond (Richter-Menge et al. 2012).|$|R

During the ice-covered period (mid-January to mid-April) total mass fluxes (dry weight) were lower than 2 gm^ day^, while after mid-April the flux increased to more than 11 gm^ day^. The dominant sterol associated with sinking particles throughout the observation period was cholesterol {{most of which were}} possibly from animal-derived sources such as scallop feces. During the ice-covered period, sterols mostly were derived from marine animals, although the sterol abundance was low in quantity. The period of phytoplankton bloom below the ice (mid-March to mid-April) did not respond to that of the maximum flux (after mid-April), but coincided with that of the occurrence of phytoplankton-derived sterols. During the <b>ice-free</b> <b>periods</b> (before mid-January and after mid-April), sinking particle sources are variable, and bottom sediment- and land-derived (mostly terrestrial plants) sterols are larger in quantity than those during the ice-covered periods, primarily because of the active water movements in the lagoon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Behavioral {{predictions}} {{based on}} optimal for-aging models that assume an energy-maximizing strategy have been challenged on both {{theoretical and empirical}} grounds. Although polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are spe-cialist predators of seal pups on the Arctic ice pack, the use of terrestrial food sources during the <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> has received increased attention {{in recent years in}} light of climate predictions. Across a 10 -day period of observation, we documented between four and six individual polar bears successfully capture at least nine flightless lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and engage in at least eight high-speed pursuits of geese. The observed predatory behaviors of polar bears do not support predic-tions made by energy-optimizing foraging models and suggest that polar bears may frequently engage in energy inefficient pursuits of terrestrial prey. Further study of the nutritional needs and foraging behaviors of polar bears during the <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> is warranted, given that polar bears are predicted to spend more time on land as climate change advances...|$|E
40|$|Present {{knowledge}} of sub-till sediments {{found in the}} valleys in the Mid-Gudbrandsdal area and the stratigraphy of the overlying basal tills is summarized. The existence of widespread waterlain sediments which {{are thought to have}} been deposited in a cold <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> of Middle/Early Weichselian age, the Gudbarndsdalen Interstadial, gives evidence of surprisingly modest ice erosion during the last ice age, even in valleys close to the highest mountains. Judging by the nearly total evacuation of older deposits fro the tributaries, the <b>ice-free</b> <b>period</b> seems to have lasted for a long time, with very strong slope processes. Huge quantities of proglacial sandur sediments accumulated in the main valleys indicate that the last inland ice sheet grew slowly. By comprehensive analyses the authors have succeeded in correlating the overlying tills with four regional glacial phases of the last ice age reconstructed mainly through analyses of striae. It is found that the conservation of the sediments, as well as the distribution of different tills, was dependent on the relative location of the ice divide...|$|E
