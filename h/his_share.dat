5|$|The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane {{was run by}} {{the holders}} {{of one of the}} two {{official}} licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over <b>his</b> <b>share.</b> In 1730, a notice in the Daily Journal stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of <b>his</b> <b>share</b> to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and <b>his</b> <b>share</b> was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented <b>his</b> <b>share</b> to his son Theophilus, an actor.|$|E

50|$|In May 1987, David Thompson {{stepped down}} from Hillsdown Holdings, selling 50% of <b>his</b> <b>shares,</b> {{becoming}} a non-executive director of the firm. In April 1989, he sold the remainder of <b>his</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upon John Heminges' {{death in}} 1630, <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres passed {{to his son}} William. William Heminges's {{disposal}} of <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> five years later would cause a major controversy within the company; see 1635 below.|$|R

She is said to have later become a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{intended}} {{to retire at}} the end of the 1969 season and sold <b>his</b> <b>share</b> in the team to Tauranac. However, Rindt's late decision to remain with Lotus meant that Brabham drove for another year. He took his last win in the opening race of the 1970 season and was competitive throughout the year, although mechanical failures blunted his challenge. Aided by number-two driver Rolf Stommelen, the team came fourth in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|Emmett, {{along with}} his friend Sam Bryant, opened the city's first oyster bar on February 18, 1979 Watson sold <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the Oyster Bar to Bryant in 1987.

50|$|Marples' {{first attempt}} to sell <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> was blocked by the Attorney-General {{on the basis that}} he was using his former {{business}} partner, Reg Ridgway, as an agent to ensure that he could buy back the shares upon leaving office. Marples therefore sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to <b>his</b> wife, reserving himself the possibility to reacquire them at the original price after leaving office; by this time, <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> had come to be worth between £350,000 and £400,000.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-one {{days before}} this date, Eastdil fired Gallagher for no {{apparent}} reason except to avoid paying for <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> at the new calculated price, which would have been much higher than book value. <b>His</b> <b>shares</b> were therefore bought back from the company at the lower book-value price.|$|R
50|$|One {{possible}} {{scenario is}} an investor with $ 10,000 dollars to invest. He invests half into stocks, {{and the other}} half into bonds or a money market fund. If <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> cost $10.00, he invested $5,000.00, so he has 500 shares. Later after a market move, he finds <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> are valued at $3.00 a share, so he has lost 70% of his stock portfolio. He now transfers $3,500 into the stock portfolio, in order to bring the value back to $5,000.00. He now has 1,666 shares. Later, the market recovers and <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> are now valued at $10.00 a <b>share.</b> <b>His</b> <b>shares</b> are now worth $16,660; he sells $11,660 and puts the proceeds into his bond portfolio. He now has $5,000 in the stock market and $13,160 in bonds.|$|R
5|$|Gandalf reappears to warn all of an {{approaching}} army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies. Bilbo accepts {{only a small portion}} of <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith. Belisarius was also named consul ordinarius for the year 535, {{allowing}} him to celebrate a second triumphal procession, being carried through the streets seated on his consular curule chair, held aloft by Vandal warriors, distributing largesse to the populace from <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the war booty.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 Ohio-native Charles Martin Hall helped pioneer the Hall–Héroult process, {{which made}} {{aluminum}} inexpensive to produce. He sold <b>his</b> <b>share</b> in 1888 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, {{known today as}} Alcoa. Alcoa has operations in the state, including facilities in Cleveland which manufacture aluminum wheels for Automobili Lamborghini.|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{rule that}} if a person sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in Company A to Company B, and instead of {{receiving}} cash he received shares in Company B, then there was no CGT payable immediately. Instead, CGT would become payable when (if ever) that person later sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in company B.|$|R
50|$|The gift of <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to the University, as {{originally}} intended, was not legally possible. Working {{with representatives of}} the Sachsen-Weimar state government, the idea of a foundation was formed. The Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung was founded in 1889; Ernst Abbe turned over <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in these firms, {{as well as those of}} Roderich Zeiss, Carl Zeiss's son, to the foundation by 1891. In 1919 Otto Schott also donated <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to the foundation, giving it the sole proprietorship of the glass works, as well. The act of incorporation lasted until 1896; an amendment governing grants to the University, followed in 1900.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, John W. Nordstrom {{retired and}} sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> of Wallin & Nordstrom to his two eldest sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Carl Wallin also retired and sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to them. 1930 marked {{the change of}} name to Nordstrom. In 1933, the third son Lloyd joined.

5|$|On Super Tuesday, Clinton won {{the largest}} states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states; they almost evenly split the total popular vote. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for <b>his</b> <b>share</b> {{of the popular}} vote due to better {{exploitation}} of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell <b>his</b> <b>share</b> in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E
5000|$|Auguste Hériot died in 1879, and his brother, Olympe, {{inherited}} <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> of the company. Chauchard sold <b>his</b> <b>shares,</b> {{for some}} unknown reason, in 1885. Then Olympe directed the company alone until 1888, {{the year when}} {{the first signs of}} his mental illness forced his resignation. He was succeeded by the son of Émile Pereire.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, O'Hara sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in Narragansett Park to James H. Connors.|$|R
5000|$|Gray {{was still}} {{president}} of Ford Motor Company when Malcomson sold <b>his</b> <b>shares.</b> However, on July 6, 1906, John S. Gray died unexpectedly of heart trouble. [...] Gray's position as Ford president {{was taken over}} by Henry Ford himself soon afterward. Gray's estate, however, retained control of <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> in the company, until Henry Ford bought them in 1919. For the 16 years that Gray and his heirs owned their stake in the company, they received total dividends of $10,355,075. [...] When the estate finally sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to Henry Ford, the price was $26,250,000, making a total return of $36,605,075 on Gray's $10,500 initial investment.|$|R
5|$|After exchanging ideas, Parker {{will write}} a script, {{and from there}} the entire team of animators, editors, technicians, and sound {{engineers}} will each typically work 100–120 hours in the ensuing week. Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production. On Wednesday, a completed episode is sent to Comedy Central's headquarters via satellite uplink, sometimes {{in just a few}} hours before its air time of 10 PM Eastern Time.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} <b>his</b> <b>share</b> {{of the gold}} to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache.

The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
25|$|Under their {{publishing}} contract with Northern Songs, Lennon and McCartney {{were bound to}} continue their songwriting until 1973. Unable {{to gain control of}} Northern Songs, Lennon and McCartney sold their stock (Lennon's 644,000 shares and McCartney's 751,000) in October1969, for £3.5 million. Starr chose to keep <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> (0.8%), but Harrison had already sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> (also 0.8%) in June1968.|$|R
50|$|Sir Ernst Chain won the Nobel Prize in 1945 for <b>his</b> <b>shared</b> work on penicillin.|$|R
50|$|By 2000, Colony Capital and Vaturi {{had settled}} their lawsuit, {{which led to}} Vaturi getting <b>his</b> Silverlink <b>shares</b> back. He soon sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to Lee Hing Development, a Hong Kong {{property}} fund which was affiliated with Thadani's Schroder Capital Partners (a Singapore-based fund). With the controlling investors now <b>sharing</b> <b>his</b> vision, Zecha returned as chairman and CEO.|$|R
5|$|Entratter {{replaced}} Freedman as {{the president}} of the Sands Hotel following his death from heart surgery on January 20, 1958. Freedman's last wife Sadie subsequently lived in a suite in the Belmont Park wing into the mid 1960s until her death. Sinatra, who had attempted to buy a share in the hotel soon after first visiting in 1953, but was denied by the Nevada Tax Commission, was now granted permission to buy a share in the hotel, due to his phenomenal impact upon business in Las Vegas. <b>His</b> <b>share,</b> variously described as from 2 to 9%, aided Freedman's wife in paying off her husband's gambling debts.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent most}} of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. His {{experiences}} in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor. He did <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and {{a partner}} bought a small general store on credit in New Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the {{business}} struggled and Lincoln eventually sold <b>his</b> <b>share.</b> That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, John W. Nordstrom {{retired and}} sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> {{to two of}} his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom {{subsequently}} joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy {{eventually}} {{moved to}} an apartment flat nearby, and restarted his life. He ultimately entered into a restaurant operation with Sandy. However, {{he was forced to}} sell off <b>his</b> <b>shares</b> because of some back room dealings made by Caleb Nichol (Kirsten Cohen's father). After the sale of <b>his</b> <b>shares,</b> he became rich once again and was able to purchase a yacht befitting a Newport Beach resident.|$|R
