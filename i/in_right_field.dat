5|$|Granderson {{agreed to}} terms with the New York Mets on a {{four-year}} contract worth $60million on December 6, 2013. Granderson's salaries were set at $13 million in 2014, $16 million in 2015 and 2016, and $15 million in 2017. The Mets played Granderson as their right fielder. He started 148 games with 130 <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field.</b> A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E

5|$|Official scorers {{are only}} {{occasionally}} terminated, {{but there have}} been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> that was ruled a hit rather than an error.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, Bradley {{signed a}} three-year, $30 million {{deal with the}} Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game {{suspension}} for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> and threw it into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning when there were only two outs. The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field.</b> In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E

5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned {{whether he would}} be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> and only 117 in center field.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ruth {{reported}} to Hot Springs, Arkansas {{for his first}} major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who had broken {{the record for the}} lowest earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth.|$|E
5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while {{trying to pick up}} a fair ball <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing each other for the division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E

5|$|On January25, 1891, it was {{reported}} that he had re-signed with the Browns for the up-coming season. The season opened April8, and the Browns faced the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers at home. Stivetts was the team's opening day starting pitcher. The game ended in the bottom of ninth inning when the umpire, former player and St. Louis native Bill Gleason, determined that Cincinnati was intentionally allowing St. Louis to score in an effort to delay the game. St. Louis was awarded the forfeit when Cincinnati refused to play. AA president, Louis Kramer, declared the forfeit illegal a short time later, and the game was re-played on April12. St. Louis won the re-match behind the pitching of Stivetts. This was Gleason's second and last career game as an umpire. Over the course of the season, Stivetts was the Browns' ace, pitching mostly every second or third game the team played. When not pitching, or when he occasionally played <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field,</b> the Browns used Joe Neale, Willie McGill, and future Hall of Fame executive Clark Griffith as part of the starting rotation. On May30, Stivetts started both games of a doubleheader in a home series versus the Philadelphia Athletics. Due to large leads by the Browns, he was pulled from each game; lasting two innings in the first and six in the second.|$|E
5|$|The hype {{surrounding}} Bonds's {{pursuit of}} the home run record escalated on May 14. On this day, Sports Auction for Heritage (a Dallas-based auction house) offered US$1 million to the fan who would catch Bonds's record-breaking 756th-career home run. The million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11 out of concern of fan safety. Home run 748 came on Father's Day, June 17, in {{the final game of}} a 3-game road series against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, where Bonds had never previously played. With this homer, Fenway Park became the 36th major league ballpark in which Bonds had hit a home run. He hit a Tim Wakefield knuckleball just over the low fence into the Giant's bullpen <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field.</b> It was his first home run off his former Pittsburgh Pirate teammate, who became the 441st different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to Bonds. The 750th career home run, hit on June 29, also came off a former teammate: Liván Hernández. The blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3–3.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} several areas {{reserved}} for {{small and large}} groups. Four field-level suites, each with 33exterior seats and additional interior space to accommodate 22people, are located directly behind home plate. The second level has 18suites with 4indoor drink rail seats and 13outdoor seats in front. Two covered party decks are located on the second level—one at each end—both of which can accommodate up to 75people each. Between {{the end of the}} lower seating bowl in left field and the outfield berm lies a group area which can accommodate up to 600individuals. This area consists of a covered picnic area, round picnic tables, rearrangeable chairs, and stadium seats. A section of 4-top tables—semi-circular tables surrounded by four chairs—that can accommodate 108people at 27tables is located {{at the end of the}} lower seating bowl <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field</b> near a specialty concession area called The Band Box. A private party area called The 375 Club, in reference to its distance from home plate, is located in the power alley in front of The Band Box and can accommodate up to 35people at 4-top tables. Next to this, and directly in front of the scoreboard, is a 200-person group picnic area with standing room and stadium seats with drink rails.|$|E

5000|$|On Monday, September 29, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the 2014 season, a $575 million four-year renovation project to Wrigley Field was begun. The bleachers <b>in</b> left and <b>right</b> <b>field</b> were expanded, the stadium was extended further onto both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, and seven new outfield signs were installed along with a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron scoreboard in the left field bleachers and a 2,400 square foot video scoreboard <b>in</b> the <b>right</b> <b>field</b> bleachers. The parking lots along Clark Street were excavated for underground players' locker rooms and lounges.|$|R
5|$|Forbes Field had an {{original}} capacity of 25,000, {{the largest in}} the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000seats. On opening day, ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $ today) for box seats and $1 (equal to $ today) for reserved grand stand sections; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50. Ticket prices were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans' views of the field. 2,000 bleachers were situated along the left field side, tickets were sold for a maximum of $1. When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games, fans were permitted to sit on the grass <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>field,</b> provided they would agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area. The lowest season of attendance came in 1914 when 139,620people attended games; the highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828people watched the Pirates play. On September 23, 1956, the stadium's largest crowd, 44,932, gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut short {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following day. At 200people, June 10, 1938 marked the smallest crowd to ever attend a Pirates game. On September 30, 1962, a crowd of 40,916people saw the Steelers defeated by the New York Giants, at the Steelers' highest-attended game at the stadium.|$|E
