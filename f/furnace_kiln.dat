5000|$|The {{town was}} {{destroyed}} by fire in 1877, at which time it had {{a population of about}} 500, most of whom were somehow involved in supporting the operations of the furnace or the local aspects of Michigan's early iron industry. It was a dry season and the woods around Onota had been burning for several days. On May 31, a strong wind from the south drove the flames into the village and ruined it in a matter of hours. The village was not rebuilt and only ruins of the <b>furnace</b> <b>kiln</b> remained, and were later partially reconstructed on the original location. In 1948, the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company gave 54 acre to the U.S. Forest Service for historical and recreational use. [...] Surrounding buildings destroyed by the fire included the casting shed, charging house, machine shop, blacksmith shop, and storage sheds.|$|E

50|$|By 1989, Lane's {{focus on}} larger-scale works {{required}} him to move to his current studio and gallery where he is still based today, a 10,000 square foot converted factory in Willesden, West London.

Students made wooden patterns in pattern making which were used to make sand molds which were cast in the foundry and machined to specification in the machine shops. It was closed during the 1990s.

In this study, three different pulverised coal burner geometries for a pulverised coal fired boiler have been studied by numerical analysis. GLI-Tunçbilek coal was used as fuel. Three-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out using Ansys Fluent code.

5000|$|A fire brick, firebrick, or {{refractory}} brick is {{a block of}} refractory ceramic material used in lining <b>furnaces,</b> <b>kilns,</b> fireboxes, and fireplaces. A {{refractory brick}} is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency. Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as {{the inside of a}} wood-fired <b>kiln</b> or a <b>furnace,</b> which is subject to abrasion from wood, fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures. In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln, more porous bricks, commonly known as [...] "kiln bricks" [...] are a better choice. They are weaker, but they are much lighter, easier to form, and insulate far better than dense bricks. In any case, firebricks should not spall, and their strength should hold up well during rapid temperature changes.|$|R

40|$|This summary updates the {{estimates}} of the amounts of process heat energy consumed by industry. Process heat applications were divided into 15 major categories, covering 16 major industry groups, including {{a wide variety of}} technologies capable of using different fuel types and capable of being used in more than one type of process heat application. Consumption of natural gas, electricity, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, oil, and coke is shown metal heat treating, smelting, agglomeration, non-metallic melting, calcining, clay firing, drying, curing and forming, fluid heating, textiles heating, food heating, bonding, and other heating.

50|$|Similar to the {{production}} of lime, magnesite can be burned in the presence of charcoal to produce MgO, which, {{in the form of a}} mineral, is known as periclase. Large quantities of magnesite are burnt to make magnesium oxide: an important refractory material used as a lining in blast <b>furnaces,</b> <b>kilns</b> and incinerators. Calcination temperatures determine the reactivity of resulting oxide products and the classifications of light burnt and dead burnt refer to the surface area and resulting reactivity of the product, typically as determined by an industry metric of the iodine number. 'Light burnt' product generally refers to calcination commencing at 450 °C and proceeding to an upper limit of 900 °C - which results in good surface area and reactivity. Above 900 °C, the material loses its reactive crystalline structure and reverts to the chemically inert 'dead-burnt' product- which is preferred for use in refractory materials such as furnace linings.|$|R

40|$|The {{suitability}} of some local clay deposits in Ekiti State, for lining the furnace {{to be used}} to degrade woody biomass to fuel and chemical products was investigated. Four major sites in Ekiti- State renowned for abundant clay deposits were selected, namely; Ikere Ekiti, Fagbohun Ekiti, Ishan Ekiti and Ara Ekiti. The clay samples were crushed, milled (pulverised) and sieved to produce very fine grains of less than 250 µm particle size distribution for all samples. They were then tested for shrinkage, bulk density, Load on ignition (LOI), cold compression strength, apparent porosity, and thermal shock resistance. Also, their mineralogical composition and fusion temperatures were examined. The densities of the clays were found to be related to their mineralogical composition as shown: Ikere Ekiti clay was found to be less dense, contains more porosity, and possesses low iron content and higher refractoriness with fusion temperature above 1500 °C. Fagbohun clay is also suitable for medium thermal application in <b>furnaces,</b> <b>kilns</b> and stoves, while the rest could be beneficiated to improve on their insulating properties. The kaolin deposit at Ikere Ekiti was found to be the best material suitable for the lining of the furnace for the pyrolysis process as the expected furnace temperature is about 1400 °...|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{calcination}} derives {{its name from}} the Latin calcinare (to burn lime) due to its most common application, the decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide, in order to create cement. The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as [...] "calcine", regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.

50|$|Landfill gas must {{be treated}} to remove impurities, condensate, and particulates. The {{treatment}} system depends on the end use. Minimal treatment is needed for the direct use of gas in boiler, <b>furnaces,</b> or <b>kilns.</b> Using the gas in electricity generation typically requires more in-depth treatment. Treatment systems are divided into primary and secondary treatment processing. Primary processing systems remove moisture and particulates. Gas cooling and compression are common in primary processing. Secondary treatment systems employ multiple cleanup processes, physical and chemical, depending on the specifications of the end use. Two constituents that {{may need to be}} removed are siloxanes and sulfur compounds, which are damaging to equipment and significantly increase maintenance cost.
