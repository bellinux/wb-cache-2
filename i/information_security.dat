40|$|Working with a socio-technical view on <b>information</b> systems <b>{{security}}</b> is a challenge. Existing {{studies show}} that {{a great number of}} security incidents are caused by trusted personnel within organizations due to the tension between the design of <b>information</b> systems <b>security</b> policies, guidelines, rules and tools, and how they actually are used. This paper describes a framework for anlyzinging users’ compliance with the creator’s intentions that underlie an <b>information</b> systems <b>security</b> design. This framework is anchored in the concept of rationality, and the result can be used, for example, to facilitate the task of analyzing security incidents, to verify existing <b>information</b> systems <b>security</b> approaches, and to match <b>information</b> systems <b>security</b> approaches with organizational requirements.

40|$|Incidents, {{threats and}} {{vulnerabilities}} {{have the potential}} to negatively affect an organisation’s assets. Information on these incidents, threats and vulnerabilities are important to security. It is therefore necessary for this <b>security</b> <b>information</b> to be effectively and efficiently managed, so that correct decisions may be made on the implementation of security risk control measures. This study explored the management of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> in the <b>security</b> industry by undertaking the following: • establishing the “status quo” of the collection and analysis of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> and the implementation of security risk control measures in practice; • identifying {{the nature and extent of}} problems experienced in the collection and analysis of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> and the implementation of security risk control measures; and the • discovery of a new <b>Security</b> <b>Information</b> Management Model (SIMM). Mixed methods research was used to study the management of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> in the <b>security</b> industry. The explorative research design was used for this purpose. Semi-structured and focus group interviews were conducted with senior security managers and operational security officers, respectively. The grounded theory research design was used to analyse the qualitative data in order to generate a substantive grounded theory. The theory is that security officers operate without a standardised framework to manage <b>security</b> <b>information.</b> The data from the semi-structured and the focus group interviews were used to design a questionnaire to conduct a survey using the quantitative approach. The non-experimental research design was used to conduct this self-administered questionnaire survey. The data from this questionnaire survey helped validate and confirm the substantive grounded theory. The study found that there was the need for a <b>Security</b> <b>Information</b> Management Model to manage <b>security</b> <b>information</b> in the <b>security</b> industry. Based on this finding the researcher recommended a new <b>Security</b> <b>Information</b> Management Model for the management of <b>security</b> <b>information</b> in the <b>security</b> industry.

40|$|Abstract—Research on <b>information</b> flow <b>security</b> for concur-rent {{programs}} usually assumes sequential consistency although modern multi-core processors often support weaker consistency guarantees. In this article, we {{clarify the}} impact that relaxations of sequential consistency have on <b>information</b> flow <b>security.</b> We consider four memory models and prove {{for each of them}} that <b>information</b> flow <b>security</b> under this model does not imply <b>information</b> flow <b>security</b> in any of the other models. This result suggests that research on security needs {{to pay more attention to}} the consistency guarantees provided by contemporary hardware. The other main technical contribution of this article is a program transformation that soundly enforces <b>information</b> flow <b>security</b> under different memory models. This program transformation is significantly less restrictive than a transformation that first establishes sequential consistency and then applies a traditional information flow analysis for concurrent programs.

The ultimate scope of this research is to investigate the importance of having an efficient goal setting structure in the context of <b>information</b> systems <b>security</b> in banking.
