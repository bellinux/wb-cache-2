5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> during fetal development, {{may result in}} a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
30|$|Inoue et al. [54] also {{compared}} PFOS concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> blood with <b>the</b> {{cord blood}} of the fetus. <b>The</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maternal blood varied from 4.9 to 17.6 μg/L, whereas the cord blood concentration had a PFOS level of 1.6 to 5.3 μg/L. A strong correlation was found between <b>the</b> PFOS concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> blood and <b>in</b> cord blood (r 2 = 0.876). In this study, PFOA was only found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother's</b> blood [54].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and general psychological symptoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic children in comparison with those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of mentally retarded children. Forty mothers of autistic children and 38 mothers of mentally retarded children were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. After a clinical interview, psychometric tests were performed for depression, anxiety, alexithymia, and Symptom Distress Check List (SCL- 90) for general psychological symptoms. Non-depression rates was 27. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic children whereas the rate was 55. 3 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of mentally retarded children. There was no difference regarding anxiety and alexithymia between the two groups. <b>The</b> psychopathology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic children was more frequent than in those of mentally retarded children in all sub-scales of SCL- 90 (somatization obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, anger-hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid thought, psychotism, and extra scale). <b>The</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic children experienced more psychological distress than those of mentally retarded children. Our findings indicates that the assessment of autistic and mentally retarded children should include psychological assessment of their mothers...|$|R

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> and child, and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a 2006 {{role-playing}} {{video game}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> series, developed by Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory, {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. The game, which is the final entry in the series, was directed by Nobuyuki Inoue, written by series creator Shigesato Itoi, and scored by composer Shogo Sakai. The story follows Lucas, a young boy with psychic abilities, and a party of characters {{as they attempt to}} prevent a mysterious invading army from corrupting and destroying the world.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a single-player {{role playing}} video game similar to {{previous}} games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> series. The player controls {{a party of}} playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for leveling up. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world, and the player can save the game by talking to frogs. Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.|$|E

5|$|The {{party is}} warped {{back to the}} top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers George's grave. Large rocks block the {{entrance}} to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's conscience. The party encounters the Mother Ship and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and flies off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> Ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother.</b> The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the possible association of drug treatments in pregnant women with a higher risk of congenital abnormalities of the external ear, particularly microtia/anotia, <b>in</b> their children. <b>The</b> frequency of drug treatments was compared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of cases with isolated or multiple (syndromic) ear abnormalities and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of three different controls: controls matched to cases, all controls (these controls had no defects) and malformed controls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population-based large dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities. There was no significantly higher use of any drug <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of 354 cases with isolated external ear abnormalities than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> of different controls. However, of 156 cases with multiple ear abnormalities, 11 had mothers with hydroxyethylrutosidea treatment and a characteristic pattern of congenital abnormalities was found in these children. Four cases with multiple ear abnormalities were born to epileptic mothers treated with valproate, phenytoin and polytherapy in two cases. Drug treatments are not important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> origin of isolated ear abnormalities. However, a higher risk of multiple ear abnormalities was found in children born to mothers with treatment of hydroxyethylrutosidea or antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} infant {{attachment}} {{can be understood}} along several different axes: the level of sensitivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother’s</b> interactions with her child, {{the degree to which}} <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> is rejecting <b>in</b> her interactions with her child, and the level of activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother’s</b> interactions with her child. The current body of research on attachment theory suggests that these specific aspects of maternal behavior play a significant role <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> attachment formed between mother and child both early in development and generally across time.
