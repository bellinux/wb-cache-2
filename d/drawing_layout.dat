Besides, we integrate this program with simulation optimization algorithms, which can generate new designs, evaluate the designs efficiently and finally identify the promising designs. ...|$|R

We present an algorithmic framework for computing the node positions {{that result in}} a planar <b>drawing.</b> <b>Layout</b> issues related to displaying the internal structure of the nodes are addressed. Each field value and associated pointer that comprises the internal structure of the node is considered a subnode. The drawing technique uses different polygonal shapes for the subnodes that allow curvature to the design. We discuss the layout of text labels for the fields of the nodes which provides good readability and which preserves the semantics of the data structure. The edge positioning shows the association of the pointers with their corresponding field label. The radial drawing of the B+-tree makes better use of the display space than the traditional hierarchical drawing...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we take a}} {{different}} approach to visualizing very large trees. To facilitate presentation and exploration of massive hierarchical datasets such as linguistic and genealogical hierarchies, our approach considers <b>drawing</b> <b>layouts</b> of tree-cuts as a function of a node-of-interest or NOI, and uses interaction to support rapid access to the entire tree. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, our layout is designed to make the most space available for the node-of-interest and its immediate ancestors and descendants. Inspired from Persian floral patterns, we describe the development of ShamsehTree and PaisleyTree, showing how the use of symmetry can provide new structures for tree layouts...|$|R
40|$|Quality of a layout has {{the most}} direct impact in the {{manufacturability}} of a design. Traditionally, layout quality is ensured in the first order by design rules, i. e. if a layout is free of design rules violation, {{it is a good}} layout. It is assumed such a layout will be fabricated to specification. Moreover, a design rule clean layout also ensures the electrical performance of the circuit it represents. There are other layout quality measures, e. g. random defects yield of a layout is modeled by critical area, systematic defects yield is sometime measured by a weighted score of recommended design rules. All the traditional layout quality measures are computed with <b>drawn</b> <b>layout</b> shapes. In the advent of low K 1 lithography and the increasing variability of process technologies beyond 90 nm, nominal layout quality measures need to be revisited. Traditionally, nominal electrical properties such as L-eff and W-eff are extracted from <b>drawn</b> <b>layout,</b> and the corner cases are estimated with worst case process conditions. Most of these parameters are layout pattern dependent. As a matter of fact, they can be systematic through process and can have large impact in the modeling of circuit parameters [1]. In this paper, we investigate a through process layout quality measure, in which we extract through process electrical parameters from simulated through process resist contours. We showed a mechanism to compute a statistical model that predicts through process electrical parameters from the process parameter variation. We demonstrated that such computation is practical. 1...|$|R
