Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E

5|$|Calgacus' fate {{is unknown}} but, {{according}} to Tacitus, {{after the battle}} Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm that Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians.

Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements.|$|E

Tiki was banished into the Idolasphere, which acted as an intermediate dimension between the real world and her world, and she was instrumental in preventing Gharnef from performing the Opera of Shadows a second time to enter the real world as his native realm had become drained of artistic energy. His attempt sparked the mass disappearance of <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>before,</b> and Tiki shielded both Tsubasa and Yashiro at the cost of her memories.|$|E
