5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{all of the}} English witch trials {{between the}} early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one trial, with its 18 executions, accounted for 3.6% of that total.|$|E
5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there were about 200 books in the monastic library.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the group}} {{containing}} the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{the solid}} earth {{as a whole}} {{contains}} 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since {{the mass of the}} earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere (below).|$|E
5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might {{be as high as}} 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E

5|$|The {{freshwater}} {{islands in}} Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers – including tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} be surrounded by freshwater. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took their wives from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important {{when it came to}} selecting their consorts. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> only a quarter of Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to {{preserve}} chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added {{to the top of a}} pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> all the English witch trials {{between the}} early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 {{accounts for more}} than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> of 92 {{potentially}} possible {{modes of}} life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — {{no more than}} a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} was never investigated {{due to the}} Japanese invasion. Later, some Army officers reported that the remote-controllable mines were set to the safety position immediately after the explosion occurred. The total number of victims is unknown. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 900–1,200 lost their lives. Among the dead were the captain {{and most of the}} crew, two of the legislators, and one of the American passengers. At the time, the sinking of the Corregidor was the most significant maritime disaster in Philippine history, and one of the greatest maritime disasters in the world that did not occur as a result of military or naval action.|$|E
