5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, {{the thought that}} {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E

25|$|Possibly {{because of}} Thornton's delay in {{crossing}} {{the river and}} the withering artillery fire that might hit them from across the river, the 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river and move across the open field to join the main force on the right of the field. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but without reinforcements they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt: within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen either flung themselves to the ground, <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful {{made it to the top}} of the parapet on the right but were either killed or captured. The 95th Rifles had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.|$|E
25|$|To explain {{himself to}} the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his {{departure}} was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not be shed in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent John, Queen Maria, Prince Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal), and the Infante Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) were all in a single ship. This was an imprudent decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and the infantas were on two other ships. The {{number of people who}} embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom had to sleep <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. Furthermore, the flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony's first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and the infantas held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

Warlock said, where Laurie is <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closet. Michael breaks through. She grabs a hanger and thrusts it up and into his eyes.

2500|$|Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook {{went out}} to bat with thunder {{in the air and}} Hutton never settled down to the short-pitched bowling of Lindwall and Miller and was bowled for 7 in “a real shock attack…Miller’s success was gained by one ball of {{perfection}} mixed with many of faulty direction which had England’s record holder twisting and turning in a most unbatsmanlike fashion”. Soon after Bill Edrich came out play was stopped for bad light as a thunderstorm broke over the ground. Play resumed only 10 minutes late the next day, but [...] "England were twice caught on sticky wickets. They stood no chance. On a typical Brisbane sticky the good length ball and the half-volley became almost unplayable. Sometimes it rose chest high. At others it skidded along the ground." [...] In their [...] "opening blitz" [...] Keith Miller dug the ball in short and [...] "nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high". “Edrich batted for 105 minutes. He suffered more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller". [...] He was out for 16, but Alan Kippax said it was [...] "one of the best knocks he had ever witnessed" [...] and worthy of a century. Wally Hammond had made his finest innings just such a wicket at Melbourne in 1936-37 while making 32 and here made the same number of runs, which Arthur Morris called it [...] "the most thorough batting lesson he had ever received" [...] Ray Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich [...] "were hit on the body repeatedly. Their concentration never faltered and their skill never waned...This was vintage batting of a kind that probably no Australian could produce". Miller used a limited leg-trap and an English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Miller slowed his pace as the ball leapt so much that it could hit the batsman, but not get them out and dismissed all five batsman that day, his 7/60 in the innings remaining his best return for Australia {{for the rest of his}} career. Only three hours play were allowed that day and just after Hammond and Yardley walked off after appealing for light a second thunderstorm hit Brisbane. [...] "Those who <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pavilion...will never forget (as will the residents of Brisbane, who lost thousands of planes of glass) the darkness that came over the ground and the roar of the storm coming in the distance. This was the day when jagged pieces of hail, as big as cricket balls, plummeted on the ground, and the covers and the stumps went swirling away in the flood". In 30 minutes the ground was a lake with the water almost reaching the height of the picket fence on the boundary. At any other venue the game would have ended, but the drought-stricken ground soaked up most of the water overnight, the Queensland sun soon dried out the ground and play began on time at noon, much to the surprise to some pressmen and players who arrived late. Ernie Toshack's left-arm medium pace should have won him a hatful of wickets the previous day, but he could not bowl as Bradman suggested. So, before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him exactly where he wanted him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Resuming on 117/5 Hammond and Yardley were both out to Toshack (3/17), the Yorkshire vice-captain after a gritty innings of 29 over two hours, and Miller wrapped up the tail to have England out for 141.|$|E
