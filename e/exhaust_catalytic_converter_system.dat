However, Mazda eventually shifted to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> <b>system.</b> According to the Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburned hydrocarbon in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures producing less hydrocarbon.

The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds.
