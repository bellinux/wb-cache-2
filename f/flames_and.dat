40|$|Edge {{detection}} {{process is}} used in image processing application to obtain the information from images. <b>Flame</b> <b>and</b> fire image processing is to judge the boundary between area of fire and nonfire region. Basically it is image based flame monitoring technique which is necessary for early fire detection, fire evaluation <b>and</b> determination of <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> fire parameter. There are many edge detection methods have been proposed over by many researchers. Some researchers use <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> fire edge detection process for different application. Different researchers developed their algorithm for getting better results. The features about edge detection of <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> fire images still not getting in some methods, hence researchers developed new one for improving the performance. In this paper we give brief review of few published methods related to the <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> fire image processing.

40|$|AbstractReal-time video fire <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> smoke {{detection}} method based on foreground image accumulation and optical flow technique is presented. Accumulation images are calculated of the foreground images which are extracted using frame differential method. Two parameters {{are used for}} the foreground image accumulation to differentiate flame candidate areas from that of smoke. The flame regions are recognized by a statistical model build by foreground accumulation image, while the optical flow is calculated and a motion feature discriminating model to recognize smoke regions is used. The algorithm could realize the real-time fire detection of the following three detection cases: fire with <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> none smoke, fire with smoke <b>and</b> none <b>flame,</b> <b>and</b> fire with both <b>flame</b> <b>and</b> smoke...|$|R
