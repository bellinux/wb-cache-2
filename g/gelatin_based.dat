40|$|In both photoacoustic (PA) and {{ultrasonic}} (US) imaging, overall {{image quality}} {{is influenced by}} the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. Consequently, with the increased use of combined PA and US (PAUS) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. To this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. Forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, Intralipid® 20 % IV fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while India Ink, Direct Red 81, and Evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. The following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 MHz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 MHz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). Results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. Based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a <b>gelatin</b> <b>base</b> with the aforementioned additives.

Later, a gelatin base became the material of choice. Gelatin gel was available at least until 1979. The name gel has continued {{to be used to}} the present day. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>based</b> color media had no melting point, and the color was cast in the media as opposed to being coated on the surface, both important properties for color media. It would, however, char at high temperature and became brittle once heated, so it was impossible to handle once used in the lighting instrument. By 1945 more heat-tolerant self-extinguishing acetate-based through-dyed materials were being manufactured (marketed as Chromoid then Cinemoid by Strand Electric). In the States Roscolene (acetate) was also developed to deal with these higher output light sources. Though cheaper, the acetate filters fell out of favor with professional organizations since they could not withstand the higher temperatures produced by the 'tungsten halogen lamps' that came into widespread use in the late 1960s. The acetate-based material was replaced by polycarbonates like Roscolar (mylar polycarbonate) and polyester based filters. These materials have superior heat tolerance when compared to acetate-based gels. Many were transparent film with a surface coating. The first dyed polyester [...] "gels" [...] were introduced by Berkey-Colortran in 1969 as Gelatran, the original deep dyed polyester. The Gelatran process is still used today to produce GAMColor (100% of the line) and Roscolux (apx. 30% of the line). Other color manufacturers, such as Lee Filters and Apollo Design Technology use a surface applied dye. (Roscolux is 70% polycarbonate and 30% deep dyed polyester.) Almost every color manufacturer today uses either polycarbonate or polyester to manufacture their [...] "gels". Even today's gels can burn out (to lighten in color starting in the center) easily, rendering them useless. To help combat this, a high temperature (HT) material (polyester having the highest melting point 480 °F (250 °C)), can be used to help prolong the life in high-heat output lighting instruments. As instrument design improves, it has become a selling point on many lights to have as little heat radiating {{from the front of the}} fixture as possible to help prevent burn-through, and help keep the stage and actors cooler during performances.|$|E

5000|$|The {{developer}} selectively reduces {{silver halide}} crystals in the emulsion to metallic silver, but only those having latent image centres created by action of light. The light sensitive layer or emulsion consists of silver halide crystals in a <b>gelatin</b> <b>base.</b> Two photons of light must be absorbed by one silver halide crystal {{to form a}} stable two atom silver metal crystal. The developer used generally will only reduce silver halide crystals that have an existing silver crystal. Faster exposure or lower light level films usually have larger grains because those images capture less light. Fine grain films, like Kodachrome, require more light to increase the chance that the halide crystal will absorb at least two quanta of light as they have a smaller cross sectional size. Therefore, silver halide crystal size is proportional to film speed. The metallic silver image has dark (black) appearance. Once the desired level of reduction is achieved the development process is halted by washing in a dilute acid and then the undeveloped silver halide is removed by dissolving it in a thiosulfate solution, a process called fixing. Most commercial film developers use a dual solution or [...] "push" [...] (pushes the films speed) development (compensating developer, like Diafine) procedure where the reducing agent e.g. hydroquinone solution soaks into and swells the gelatin then the film is introduced into the alkaline solution which activates (lowers reduction potential) of the developer. The areas with the most light exposure use up the tiny amount of developer in the gelatin and stop making silver crystal before the film at that point is totally opaque. The areas that received the least light continue to develop because they haven't used up their developer. There is less contrast, but time is not critical and films from several customers and different exposures will develop satisfactorily.|$|R

40|$|A {{holographic}} dielectric grating is a {{diffraction grating}} comprised of a periodic {{variation of the}} refractive index of a medium, and is produced by the interference pattern of two monochromatic waves. Emphasis is placed upon photographic emulsion as the medium for recording the pattern, but the treatment is general and includes any material that can have an internal modulation of the refractive index. Three topics are treated: the effective dielectric constant of the emulsion, the diffraction of light by dielectric gratings, and the techniques for producing gratings with high efficiency and good resolution. The photographic emulsion is treated as an artificially loaded material, i. e. as a suspension of grains in a <b>gelatin</b> <b>base.</b> A Mie scattering theory analysis is used {{and the effect of}} adjacent scatterers on the local field is accounted for by the Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The optical density of the emulsion is shown to be proportional to the number of grains present. The effective index variation after bleaching is proportional to the pre-bleached optical density, which implies that the emulsion should have a linear density vs. exposure curve to effect a sinusoidally modulated index of refraction. A relation between the modulation transfer function (MTF) of bleached and unbleached emulsion is derived. Means for improvement of the MTF is also obtained analytically. The diffraction of light by a dielectric grating is analyzed using the Raman-Nath formalism which is generalized to include loss. Graphs are presented showing the diffraction efficiency versus the index modulation {{for a wide range of}} thicknesses and loss. The peak efficiency for arbitrary emulsion thickness can be obtained from measurements at a specific thickness. The conclusion is reached that presently available emulsion should be made thicker, preferably in the 20 - 30 micron range. The basic physical processes of various holographic materials are described. The processing techniques of photographic emulsion are emphasized and the merits of various bleaches are evaluated. It is found that resolution can be increased by using a reversal process. The dielectric grains in an emulsion processed this way are round in shape. A desensitizing dye can be used to stabilize the grains. A method of extending the dynamic range of the photographic emulsion using a pre-flashing exposure technique is also described.

Odyssey infrared scanning evaluated this on a macroscopic level, whereas confocal microscopy focused on a more microscopic approach. The expression of proteases released into the culture media was also examined.

Altering the composition by adding a basement membrane-like material, Matrigel, does not statistically affect the average fiber diameter.

The importance of this research is because the template is cheap, non-toxic and easy to produce and to decompose by EDTA at basic pH. The template was prepared by mixing the same volume of salts, Na 2 CO 3 and CaCl 2. It was characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen sorption, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and zeta potential. The obtained results demonstrate that the template has a particle size of about 4 μm with a wide distribution of mesopores. The microgel has been obtained by two ways by using the CaCO 3 template.
