5|$|Monica Reyes {{was born}} and raised in Mexico City, Mexico, and speaks fluent Spanish. She studied {{folklore}} and mythology at Brown University, and has a master's degree in Religious Studies. In 1990, Reyes enrolled in the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Quantico, Virginia. Her first assignment in the FBI was serving on a special taskforce investigating Satanic ritual abuse. Reyes then served in the New York City <b>field</b> <b>office,</b> where she became romantically involved with special agent Brad Follmer despite the FBI's strict anti-fraternization rules. Reyes was the head investigator in the kidnapping of 7 year-old Luke Doggett, son of then NYPD officer John Doggett. The boy was eventually found dead, but no suspect was ever apprehended. In 1999, Monica Reyes transferred to the New Orleans <b>field</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Reyes was {{contacted}} by Doggett, now an FBI agent assigned to X-Files department, {{to assist in}} on a case involving the disappearances of several individuals {{who claimed to be}} alien abductees, as well as the disappearance of fellow agent Fox Mulder. Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may have simply formed a cult, but did not rule out the possibility of alien intervention. She stayed with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her <b>field</b> <b>office</b> soon after.|$|E
50|$|In October 2016, the Trump {{campaign}} had 178 <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> compared to Clinton's 489. The Trump campaign's number of <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> lagged far behind those Romney and Obama in 2012. Political science research showed that <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> had a modest {{positive effect on}} a candidate's vote share. The Trump campaign was reportedly almost fully reliant on the Republican National Committee for <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> in swing states. As the <b>field</b> <b>offices</b> are organized by state and local Republican parties, {{they may not have}} been strategically located in terms of boosting turnout for the Republican presidential candidate.|$|R

The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British <b>Field</b> <b>Office</b> had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

Scully subsequently learns that the Bureau's newly promoted deputy director, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), has launched a manhunt in search for Mulder. The investigation is being led by an FBI special agent named John Doggett. Scully and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) are taken to the task force's <b>field</b> <b>office</b> to be questioned, despite protests {{that they would be}} the most qualified to lead the manhunt themselves.

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Mahone was being blackmailed by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), a Secret Service agent {{forced to work}} for the Company. Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for his silence. Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop chasing the escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents.
