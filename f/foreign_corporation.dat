5|$|The Supreme Court {{also decided}} whether foreign {{corporations}} are also within {{the jurisdiction of}} a state, ruling that a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> which sued in a state court {{in which it was}} not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E

50|$|Most systems tax both {{domestic}} and <b>foreign</b> <b>corporations.</b> Often, domestic corporations are taxed on worldwide income while <b>foreign</b> <b>corporations</b> are taxed only on income from sources within the jurisdiction.

25|$|Round-tripping: Here, {{money is}} {{deposited}} {{in a controlled}} <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> offshore, preferably in a tax haven where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a foreign direct investment, exempt from taxation. A variant on this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, when the money is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.|$|E
25|$|Questions {{of public}} policy. In {{analyzing}} the factors, {{the subject matter}} of the complaint may touch on a sensitive issue that is important to the laws of either the original jurisdiction or the alternative forum. Those public policy issues must be pinpointed, analyzed and briefed in a way that makes it clear why this issue overrides the other factors. For example, an employee suing a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers. See the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) for further reference.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{left the}} {{military}} and took {{a job in the}} Imperial and <b>Foreign</b> <b>Corporation.</b> He remained there until 1922 when he was offered a position by Major Ernest Belcher as financial adviser in the British Empire Exhibition Tour. The purpose of the Tour was to promote the forthcoming British Empire Exhibition, which was to be held at Wembley in 1924 and 1925. The Tour departed in January 1922 and returned ten months later. During that time, Christie and Agatha visited many places around the world and came to know Major Ernest Belcher, who led the Tour and subsequently organised many parts of the Wembley Exhibition.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, MCA Records delayed {{a multimillion-dollar}} sale of Hendrix's {{publishing}} copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement. He {{acknowledged that he}} had sold distribution rights to a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> in 1974, but stated {{that it did not}} include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue. Under a settlement reached in July 1995, Al Hendrix prevailed in his legal battle and regained control of his son's song and image rights. [...] He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the family-run company Experience Hendrix LLC, formed in 1995. In August 2009, Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainment's Legacy Recordings division which would take effect in 2010. Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010 Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project, starting with the release of Valleys of Neptune in March of that year. In the months before his death, Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled Black Gold, which are now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC; as of 2013 no official release date has been announced.|$|E

2500|$|A {{domestic}} corporation {{may be considered}} to be a [...] "person" [...] within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. [...] It is not necessary to treat a corporation as a person in all circumstances. [...] United States case law is confusing concerning this matter when dealing with foreign corporations, and their operation within the United States. [...] Especially troubling have been rulings concerning the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] A foreign agent may not claim Fifth Amendment provisions against self-incrimination. Nor can records be withheld from subpoena duces tecum on the grounds that production of such documents would incriminate officers or other members of the <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation.</b> [...] However, there is case authority in which foreign corporations have been protected from illegal searches and seizures, including documents and books. [...] The matter of a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> operating as a [...] "person" [...] within the United States being afforded protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is discussed.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jesse Zwick of The New Republic criticized RT, stating it {{held that}} [...] "civilian {{casualties}} in Syria are minimal, foreign intervention would be disastrous, and any humanitarian appeals from Western nations are a thin veil for a NATO-backed move to isolate Iran, China, and Russia." [...] He wrote that RT wants to [...] "make the United States {{look out of}} line for lecturing Russia." [...] Zwick also wrote that RT provided a [...] "disproportionate amount of time" [...] to covering libertarian Republican Ron Paul during his 2012 presidential campaign. Writing after her 2014 on-air resignation, Liz Wahl suggested {{the reason for this}} [...] "wasn't his message of freedom and liberty but his non-interventionist stance and consistent criticism of U.S. foreign policy. His message fit RT's narrative that the United States is a huge bully." [...] In a June 2011 broadcast of Adam vs. the Man, host Adam Kokesh had endorsed fundraising for Paul, leading to a complaint to the Federal Election Commission charging a political contribution had been made by a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation.</b> Kokesh denied his cancellation in August was related to the complaint, but said it did involve Paul's aide Jesse Benton.|$|E
50|$|Corporations can be {{classified}} into domestic, foreign and partnership. A <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> is either resident foreign or non-resident <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation.</b> A resident <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> is a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> engaged in trade or business in the country. A non-resident <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> is a <b>foreign</b> <b>corporation</b> not engaged in trade or business within the country but deriving income from sources in the country. A partnership is a business structure where ownership and management responsibility of a company is split between two or more individuals. A partnership is not a legal entity that is separate from the owners and therefore the partnership itself does not pay taxes.|$|E
