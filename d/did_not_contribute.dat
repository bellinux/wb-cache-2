5|$|Comair {{discovered}} {{after the}} accident that all of its pilots had been using an airport map that did not accurately reflect changes made to the airport layout during ongoing construction work. The NTSB later determined that this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to the accident. Construction work was halted {{after the accident}} on the orders of Fayette Circuit Judge Pamela Goodwine {{in order to preserve}} evidence in the crash pending the inspection by safety experts and attorneys for the families of the victims.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

5|$|From July to August 1764, Johnson {{negotiated}} a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had {{stayed out of}} the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.|$|E
5|$|The Region 1 disc is by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was {{released}} on February 20, 2007, and is available on DVD and BD formats. The Warner Bros. Region 2 DVD {{was released}} on March 12, 2007. It is also available in both BD and regionless HD DVD in Europe (before HD DVD was cancelled). Special features are minimal, with the documentary Director's Notebook: The Prestige â€“ Five Making-of Featurettes, running roughly twenty minutes combined, an art gallery and the trailer. Nolan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to a commentary as he felt the film primarily relied on an audience's reaction {{and did not want}} to remove the mystery from the story.|$|E
5|$|The first sixteen {{issues of}} Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style {{was changed to}} a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually {{accompanying}} the summary of each story, {{in an attempt to}} make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier {{was the only one of}} these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of Unknowns last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.|$|E

5|$|Coppola {{originally}} intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to {{his commitment to the}} filming of Gardens of Stone (1987), engaged Arnold Schulman who scripted Capra's A Hole in the Head (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with David Seidler on the Tucker project. Subsequently, Coppola rewrote the Schulman and Seidler scripts, but an attempt to get a co-writing credit on the film was overruled by the Writers Guild of America, as an arbitration committee determined Coppola <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> enough to the script to warrant an on-screen writing credit. The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both Labyrinth and Howard the Duck. Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and pre-production proceeded.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. This {{was not the case}} for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful. Hammurabi used {{his power to}} {{undertake}} a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples. In c. 1801 BC, the powerful kingdom of Elam, which straddled important trade routes across the Zagros Mountains, invaded the Mesopotamian plain. With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna, destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time. In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa. Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity {{and were able to}} crush the Elamites, although Larsa <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> greatly to the military effort. Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c. 1763 BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} the video game Final Fantasy X-2 was {{composed}} by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. Regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> any of the music, despite having composed {{the majority of the}} soundtrack for the first game, Final Fantasy X. The Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack was released on two Compact Discs in 2003 by Avex. After the release of Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission, an album entitled Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack composed of the songs added to the soundtrack for that game was released in 2003 by Avex. Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Noriko Matsueda, Takahito Eguchi, Hiroko Kokubu, Masahiro Sayama, and Febian Reza Pane, was released by Avex in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the video game Final Fantasy XIII was {{composed}} by Masashi Hamauzu. Former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> any pieces to the soundtrack. Music from the game has been released in several albums. The main soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack, was released on four Compact Discs in 2010 by Square Enix, the developers and producers of the game. Selections from the soundtrack have been released on two gramophone record albums, W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII and W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries, both in 2010 by Square Enix. An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-, was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements, Piano Collection Final Fantasy XIII. The theme song for the Japanese version of the game, , was released as a single by For Life Music in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the {{expanded}} offerings <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> well to the series, alongside the late-2000s recession; sales of most rhythm games including Guitar Hero and DJ Hero did not meet expectations, falling about 50% short of projected targets. Activision announced it would be cutting back to only 10 SKUs within 2010 instead of the 25 in 2009. Though RedOctane and Neversoft continued to develop the 6th main game, , until its completion, both studios were later shuttered by Activision, moving key personnel into Activision directly for future game development, {{and in the case}} of Neversoft, closing its Guitar Hero division, while transferring future development duties for the series to Vicarious Visions, another Activision studio which had been fundamental in building the Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the games. In November 2010, Activision also closed Budcat Creations, the arm of the publisher that was primarily responsible for porting the Guitar Hero games to the PlayStation 2.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> to the album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly been missing {{for at least two}} months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N' Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>contribute</b> much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
