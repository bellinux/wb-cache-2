5000|$|In 1976, Ben Bauer <b>integrated</b> <b>matrix</b> and {{discrete}} systems into USQ, or Universal SQ.It was {{a hierarchical}} 4-4-4 discrete matrix that used the SQ matrix as the baseband for discrete quadraphonic FM broadcasts using additional difference signals called [...] "T" [...] and [...] "Q". For a USQ FM broadcast, the additional [...] "T" [...] modulation was placed at 38 kHz in quadrature {{to the standard}} stereo difference signal and the [...] "Q" [...] modulation was placed on a carrier at 76 kHz. For standard 2-channel SQ Matrix broadcasts, CBS recommended that an optional pilot-tone be placed at 19 kHz in quadrature to the regular pilot-tone to indicate SQ encoded signals and activate the listeners Logic decoder. CBS argued that the SQ system should be selected as the standard for quadraphonic FM because, in FCC listening tests of the various four channel broadcast proposals, the 4:2:4 SQ system, decoded with a CBS Paramatrix decoder, outperformed 4:3:4 (without logic) {{as well as all}} other 4:2:4 (with logic) systems tested, approaching the performance of a discrete master tape within a very slight margin. [...] At the same time, the SQ [...] "fold" [...] to stereo and mono was preferred to the stereo and mono [...] "fold" [...] of 4:4:4, 4:3:4 and all other 4:2:4 encoding systems.|$|E
50|$|The folding and the {{unfolding}} of the proteins {{also contribute to the}} physical and mechanical properties of the fibers formed. Studies have shown that reversible “sol-gel” transformations within the amorphous areas of the fibers. Sol-gel refers to the production of solid materials from small molecules. In material science, the process involves the transformation of monomers into a colloidal solution (sol) that acts as the precursor to an <b>integrated</b> <b>matrix</b> (gel). When the stabilizing bond between the fibers are broken, the system responds by unfolding or slipping in attempt to relieve the tension. The bonds would then rearrange in a less stressed position. The uncoiling of the fibers, and to a less extent the stretching of bonds, contributes to the elastic properties of the fiber. While the plastic properties, or flow, are due to the slipping of protein chains pass one another.The behavior of the fibers can be shown by mechanical models consisting of combinations of springs and dashpots connected in various combinations as demonstrated in figure 2. The deformation of fibers can either be reversible, in the form of elastic properties, or irreversible, in the form of plastic properties. The elastic properties are represented by Hooke’s law constant (g1 and g2), while the plastic properties are presented by a dashpot characterized by viscosity (μ). The system in which the spring is in conjunction with the dashpot {{on the right side of}} figure is known as the Maxwell viscoelastic unit. The deformation can then be described by the spring system in conjunction with the Maxwell unit. An applied force, f1, on this model would be the sum of the partial forces f1 on the spring at the left and f2 on the Maxwell unit. The resulting strain on the system is dependent on the spring constants and the viscosity of the dashpot. The general assumption is that the dashpot behavior is Newtonian, in which the flow of the viscous elements is directly proportional to the applied stress on the element. This model only provides a simplified behavior of fibers, but in most cases, especially the protein fibers, the characteristics are much more complex.|$|E

40|$|To {{alleviate}} {{the issue of}} data sparsity in collaborative filtering (CF), a number of trust-aware recommendation methods have been proposed recently.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Researchers {{resort to}} a wide range of {{simplified}} representations at the continuum scale, to model creep–fatigue damage in viscoplastic heterogeneous materials, such as Sn–Pb eutectic solders, caused by thermomechanical and mechanical cyclic loading (e. g., due to power cycling, environmental temperature cycling, vibration, etc.). Typically, in macroscale phenomenological damage models, the cyclic damage is assumed to depend on some loading parameter, such as cyclic strain range, work dissipation per cycle, partitioned strain range, partitioned work dissipation per cycle, cyclic entropy changes, cyclic stress range, <b>integrated</b> <b>matrix</b> creep, etc. In many instances, some of these variables are weighted with a factor to account for rate-dependent effects. The task of finding the best damage metric is difficult because of complex microstructural interactions between cyclic creep and cyclic plasticity due to the high homologous temperature under operating conditions. In this study, we use insights obtained from microstructural and more mechanistic modeling to identify the most appropriate macroscale damage metrics. The microstructural models are based on such phenomena as grain boundary sliding, blocking of grain boundary sliding by second-phase particles, volumetric and grain boundary surface diffusion, void nucleation, void growth, and plastic collapse of cavitating grain boundaries.
