This provides us with much valuable case study, since such phenomena can provide a direct glimpse into the partonic behavior of a hadron in a dominant gluonic region. We use the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) in the kt-factorization framework. The UPDF of Kimber et al. (KMR) and Martin et al.

40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to study the high-energy $QCD$ events, such as the di-jet {{productions}} from proton-proton inelastic collisions at the $LHC$ in the forward-center and the <b>forward-forward</b> configurations, using the $unintegrated$ parton distribution functions ($UPDF$) in the $k_t$-factorization framework. The $UPDF$ of $Kimber$ et. al. ($KMR$) and $Martin$ et. al. ($MRW$) are generated in the leading order ($LO$) and next-to-leading order ($NLO$), using the $Harland-Lang$ et al.

Therefore, such a computation can provide a valuable test-field for these $UPDF$. We find very good agreement with the corresponding di-jet production data available from $LHC$ experiments. On the other hand, as we have also stated in our previous works, (i. e. the protons longitudinal and transverse structure function as well as hadron-hadron $LHC$ $W/Z$ production), the present calculations based on the $KMR$ prescriptions show a better agreement with the corresponding experimental data.

40|$|Measurements {{using the}} PHENIX forward {{detectors}} at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in high-energy deuteron-gold (d+Au) collisions {{enable us to}} study cold nuclear matter effects in nucleon structure at small parton-momentum fraction, or Bjorken-x. The large gluon densities in Lorentz-contracted gold nuclei enable us {{to search for the}} yet-unobserved saturation of the gluon distribution at small x, which is caused by a balance between gluon fusion and splitting. Gluon saturation is described by the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) theory [1], which predicts a suppression of inclusive particle production in heavy-ion collisions, in particular at forward rapidity, because of a decreased gluon density. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} forward rapidity di-hadron correlations may elucidate CGC effects with two signatures that are specific predictions from CGC: awayside-yield suppression and angular broadening [2]. This thesis describes the first experimental measurements of these forward di-hadron correlations in PHENIX. Previously, RHIC experiments have shown a suppression in the single-particle nuclear modification factors (RdA, Rcp) for sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV d+Au collisions in the forward (deuteron) direction [3, 4]. Multiple theories can explain the observed suppression (including CGC), but a conclusive measurement discriminating amongst the models has yet to be carried out. Two new forward-rapidity electromagnetic calorimeters (Muon Piston Calorimeters or MPCs, âˆ’ 3. 7 < eta < âˆ’ 3. 1, 3. 1 < eta < 3. 9) enable the PHENIX experiment to measure the single-particle nuclear modification factors in addition to further understanding forward particle production with the forward di-hadron correlation measurements. Azimuthal correlations of di-hadron pairs at different pseudorapidities allow us to scan the x-dependence of correlated di-hadron production, which can then be used to discriminate amongst the models that compete to explain the observed levels of forward particle production. More specifically, the x-dependence of the yields and widths of the correlated peaks can be measured, rigorously testing the theoretical models that attempt to explain the forward particle production. The forward-rapidity correlations are especially interesting because it is expected that they provide a test of gluon saturation down to x ~ 5 Ã— 10 âˆ’ 4 in the Au-nucleus. In this thesis, we present results based on the high integrated-luminosity data sample of proton-proton (p+p) and d+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV taken at RHIC in 2008. In order to produce the results in the relatively new MPC, a significant effort was concurrently invested into tasks related to the detector efficacy, including: improving the electromagnetic-shower reconstruction algorithm, devising and implementing the detector calibration, and creating the simulated particle-reconstruction efficiency and simulated particle-identification schemes. The relevant details of this work are shown followed by the physics analyses, which we summarize in what follows. We first present the PHENIX sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV inclusive neutral pion RdA results as well as the p+p neutral pion differential cross section and the d+Au invariant yields for the pseudorapidity ranges of 3. 0 < eta < 3. 4, 3. 4 < eta < 3. 8, and 3. 0 < eta < 3. 8. We observe a similar trend in the suppression of RdA as first observed by the BRAHMS experiment in the forward direction wherein the suppression increases with decreasing collision impact parameter [3]. We also observe a larger suppression in the higher-rapidity bin (3. 4 < eta < 3. 8) as compared to the lower (3. 0 < eta < 3. 4). These results are compared with the nuclear-shadowing model of Qiu and Vitev [5], and the comparison shows that nuclear shadowing alone is unable to explain the observed level of suppression. We then proceed to show three sets of di-hadron correlation functions: two sets wherein a particle is at midrapidity (|eta| < 0. 35) and the other is at forward rapidity (3. 0 < eta < 3. 8) in the MPC (termed mid-forward correlations), and another wherein both particles are detected at forward rapidity in the MPC (<b>forward-forward</b> correlations). For both the mid-forward and <b>forward-forward</b> correlations, we quantify the yields of the correlated awayside signal and form the di-hadron nuclear modification factor JdA, which is the correlated two-particle analogue of RdA. We again observe an increasing suppression with decreasing impact parameter, but in addition we see a very large suppression in JdA that reaches JdA ~ 0. 1 for the <b>forward-forward</b> correlations; it is these correlations that are expected to be most sensitive to gluon-saturation effects [6]. To summarize the JdA data, the measured values are plotted versus our estimate of the parton momentum-fraction in the Au-nucleus, xAufrag. We observe an increasing level suppression with decreasing xAufrag, which would seem to support the predictions of CGC. However, predictions from other models, notably initial-state energy loss with nuclear shadowing, are necessary to eliminate other possible explanations. We also present simulation studies in the appendix that raise questions about the nature of particle production for the <b>forward-forward</b> correlations. In particular, the <b>forward-forward</b> correlated di-hadron signal in the PYTHIA p+p monte-carlo simulations does not seem to originate from di-jet production, but from some other momentum-conserving process. While PYTHIA admittedly does not correctly simulate the partonic interactions, this study still raises questions about the nature of di-jet production in this region...|$|E

In the latter, they are formulated in the simplest, most concise, most efficient, and most fundamental form of ADI-FDTD. The unified update equations {{and implementation of}} the efficient fundamental ADI-FDTD schemes are provided. Such efficient fundamental schemes have substantially less right-hand-side update coefficients and field variables compared to the conventional ADI-FDTD schemes. Thus, they feature higher efficiency with reduced memory indexing and arithmetic operations. Other aspects such as field and parameter memory arrays, perfect electric conductor and perfect magnetic conductor implementations are also discussed.

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (apoptosis) {{is the most}} common {{mechanism}} of cell death in eukaryotes. The ability of cancer cells to evade and inhibit apoptosis has become a hallmark feature of cancer. This is accomplished through a family of proteins known as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) {{is one of the best}} characterized IAPs. XIAP suppresses apoptosis by forming complexes with cysteine-aspartic proteases (caspase), through one of its baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains. Its activity is endogenously antagonized by a second mitochondria derived activator of caspase (Smac). The anti-apoptotic behaviour of XIAP and the critical role it plays in the apoptotic program makes the Smac-XIAP interaction an important drug target. To this end, our laboratory is interested in synthesizing biologically related Smac mimetics which can induce apoptosis in a MDA-MB- 231 cell line. Efforts have focused on (1) understanding BIR domain binding sites which allow for this interaction, and (2) the design and synthesis of molecules which are much more effective at inducing apoptosis compared to other well known analogues. Through the synthesis and evaluation of various divalent Smac mimetics we have been able to support the hypothesis that the likely binding site on XIAP is the BIR 3 domain. As well, through the synthesis of a library of novel compounds, as described in the thesis, we have been able to assess the nature of the linker which joins the two tetrapeptide units. In our effort to understand which domains Smac binds with, various divalent analogues were synthesized containing MeAVPI-linker-IPVMeA (forward-reverse) and MeAVPI-linker-MeAVPI (<b>forward-forward)</b> sequence, which incorporated linkers with varying degrees of flexibility. We hypothesized that the <b>forward-forward</b> divalent mimetics would have decreased activity compared to the peptides synthesized in a forward-reverse fashion. Lastly, information gathered from structure activity relationship (SAR) studies have shown that substituting the lysine (P 2) and isoleucine residues (P 4) in the AVPI protein can create more potent inducers of apoptosis than its native AVPI sequence. As one of the most potent Smac mimetic that has been previously made known contains an alkyne bridge at P 2 and a large hydrophobic moiety at P 4, we hypothesized that similar Smac mimetics containing a propargyl glycine residue at P 2 and a bulky hydrophobic moiety at P 4 will be much more potent in inducing apoptosis...|$|E

As was shown in this research, diffusive shock acceleration can account for a large population of the shocks. However, Parker and Zank (2012, 2014) and Parker et al.
