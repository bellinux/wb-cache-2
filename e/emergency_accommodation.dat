Exact figures are unknown, but reliable estimates were calculated based on train arrivals, foot traffic, and the extent to which <b>emergency</b> <b>accommodation</b> had to be organised. The city authorities did not distinguish between residents and refugees when establishing casualty numbers and [...] "took great pains to count all the dead, identified and unidentified". This was largely achievable because most of the dead succumbed to suffocation; in only four places were recovered remains so badly burned that it proved impossible to ascertain the number of victims. The uncertainty introduced by this is thought to amount to a total of no more than 100. 35,000 people were registered with the authorities as missing after the raids, around 10,000 of whom were later found alive.|$|E

Background At any given moment, tens of thousands of people in Canada are homeless or marginally housed [1, 2]—that is, live places unfit for human habitation (e. g., outdoors, vehicles, etc.) or temporary, transitional, or <b>emergency</b> <b>accommodations</b> (e. g., <b>emergency</b> shelters, hostels, etc.). Homeless and marginally housed persons have consist-ently reported levels of alcohol and/or illicit drug use many times higher than the stably housed population [3 - 7]. For example, a recent study of a large sample of homeless persons in Toronto found that 60 % had a life-time prevalence of regular illicit drug use and 40 % reported active use of illicit drugs other than marijuana [3]. A cohort study of homeless and marginally housed youth in Vancouver reported that 41. 1 % had used drugs by injection [4]. Another study of homeless women in Vancouver noted that 82. 4 % of its sample regularly use...|$|R
50|$|Displaced {{refugees}} {{relocated to}} less troubled {{parts of the}} Syria. Refugees fled in desperation to escape violence, chaos, and shortages of food, medicine, and other necessities. It became harder for people to find {{a safe place to}} settle because 3,000-6,000 refugees left Syria every day and refugee centers filled to capacity. There is increasing concern about the exploitation of female refugees. Orthodox Christian refugees began to arrive in the United States. In August, there is a sharp increase in refugees entering Bulgaria. Bulgarian refugee centers are at capacity and the government seeks <b>emergency</b> <b>accommodations</b> and asks the EU and Red Cross for aid. At this time the UN confirms that many thousands of refugees flee to Iraqi Kurdistan. The UNHCR estimates that more than 4,600 refugees arrive in Italy by sea this year, two-thirds of whom arrive in August. In September, Sweden becomes the first EU country to grant permanent residency to all asylum seekers, and the right to family reunification, in light of worsening conditions in Syria. Roughly 8,000 Syrian refugees in Sweden are affected by the ruling. The decision is welcomed, but some warn that it may be a boon for people-smuggling operations. In September, countries in South America (mainly Argentina and Brazil) offer refuge to Syrians. More than three hundred refugee families have already arrived in Argentina. Brazil is the first country in the Americas to offer humanitarian visas to refugees. Brazil's embassies in countries neighboring Syria issue travel visas and allow for claims on arrival in Brasil. An estimated 1.5 million Syrians are refugees by year end.|$|R
