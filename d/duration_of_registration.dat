In 1996, Megan’s Law allowed for the public disclosure of registry information, and subsequent amendments to the Wetterling Act required states to post information about convicted sex offenders on Internet websites.

40|$|Semiochemicals are {{substances}} that evoke behavioural or physiological responses. Pheromones modify the behaviour of other individuals {{of the same}} species, while allelochemicals act on individuals of different species. Pheromones are used in plant protection (i) {{to interfere with the}} mating behaviour of pests ('mating disruption'), (ii) to attract pests to insecticidal traps or baits ('attract and kill'), (iii) to trap pests ('mass trapping'), and (iv) to monitor pest populations. Semiochemicals present a particular case among active ingredients used in plant production products, as they are only substances not intended to kill the pest organism directly. The current regulatory system of pesticides is often seen as a major hurdle for the market introduction of new semiochemicals. The EU-funded Specific Support Action project 'REBECA' has held a series of workshops with stakeholder representatives. The following proposals for improvement were elaborated: (1) collective listing of the 'straight-chained lepidopteran pheromones' (SCLPs) in Annex 1 of directive 91 / 414 /EEC; (2) treating SCLPs as 'low risk' substances under the new pesticides legislation; (3) relaxations concerning the identification of impurities; (4) more flexibility in the number of samples to be analysed; (5) facilitations in the risk assessment of SCLPs; (6) a procedure which will lead to in the risk assessment of other semiochemicals in the long term; (7) flexibility in efficacy evaluation; (8) harmonisation <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> requirements.

30|$|After arrival (usually within {{few weeks}} or months) and given a minimum <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> residence, <b>registration</b> is {{compulsory}} in all countries except in Italy. However, incentives for registration vary significantly between countries and possibly are enforced differently. For example, in Germany, fines can be imposed for infringement, but is rarely enforced due to government authorities’ lack of resources to control unregistered residents. In the other countries, access to welfare benefits and services is contingent on being a legal resident, and non-registration may have negative consequences. For example, in Sweden and Denmark each legal (i.e. registered) resident has their own personal identification number, which makes opening a bank account and accessing daily public services easier. In Spain, registration is mandatory for accessing basic services, such as primary health care and education. There are also public campaigns for registration because municipal budgets depend {{on the number of}} registered residents. However, statistical information on the amount of undercoverage is missing in almost all countries, {{and it is difficult to}} estimate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) need to {{be aware}} of the risk factors for suicide. GP records may provide clues to identifying the relative importance of such risk factors. AIMS: To identify, in suicide cases and matched controls, the patterns of consultation, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness, and recording of risk factors for suicide. To examine the usefulness of data routinely collected by GPs in computerized databases to investigate treatment of patients in general practice prior to suicide. METHOD: Case control study using GP records from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Three controls selected for each case, matched for age, sex, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> with practice. Information extracted of the prevalence of major disease; diagnosis of, and treatment, or referral for, mental illness; frequency of recording of recent life events; and consultations with the GP in the 12 months prior to death. RESULT: Of the 339 suicide cases recorded, 80 % were male, which is similar to the national percentage for this age group. Females were more likely than males to have a history of mental illness and to have been diagnosed and treated for mental illness in the 12 months before death (59 % versus 35 %), and women were more likely to have previously attempted suicide (47 % versus 27 %). There was no significant difference between males and females in period of time since last contact with GP practice, but females consulted more frequently. Twenty-nine per cent of cases had not consulted their GP in the six months prior to death. In multivariate analysis, the following were identified as independent risk factors: history of attempted suicide; untreated serious mental illness (odds ratio > 20); recent (past 12 months) marital life event; alcohol abuse; frequent consultations with GP; and previous mental illness. Recording of life events by GPs was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Females at risk of suicide are more likely than males to have been diagnosed and treated for mental illness. It is likely that GPs are under-diagnosed and under-treating males at risk. Data from the GPRD give comparable results to those from other studies. The GPRD is a potentially useful tool for research into relatively uncommon events in general practice...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} {{monograph}} is to update the estimation of the number of people living with cancer in Italy, to describe geographic variability, and estimate the number of long-term survivors, i. e., people living five years or more after a cancer diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the study included the data of the AIRTUMdatabase. Twenty-four Cancer Registries (CRs) (covering 27 % of the Italian population) collected information on the incidence and vital status of 1, 275, 353 cases diagnosed between 1978 and 2005. For each CR, the observed prevalence was calculated up to the maximum observable duration. To estimate the complete prevalence (all living patients, independently from time since diagnosis) and the prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the CR maximum <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> the observed prevalence was corrected through a completeness index. Completeness indices, gender, age and site specific, were estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available from CRs with more than 15 years of observation. As of 1 January 2006, the prevalence was estimated (as absolute numbers and as a proportion per 100, 000 inhabitants) for 46 cancer sites, by gender, age class, years since diagnosis and geographic areas. RESULTS: as of 2006, 2, 244, 000 persons (4 %of the Italian population) were alive with a cancer diagnosis. A relevant geographic variability emerged, with proportions between 4 %- 5 % among CRs in the Centre and North of Italy, and proportions between 2 %- 3 % in the South. Forty-four percent of prevalent subjects (988, 000) were males and 56 % (1, 256, 000) females. Fifty-seven percent (1, 285, 680 people, 2. 2 % of total population) of these patients was represented by long-term survivors. In patients aged 75 years or more, the proportions of prevalent cases were 19 %in males and 13 %in females, and 10 %between 60 and 75 years of age in both genders. More than half a million Italian women were alive with a breast cancer diagnosis (42 %of women with a neoplasm), followed by women with cancers of the colonrectum (12 %), corpus uteri (7 %), thyroid (5 %), and cervix uteri (4 %). In men, 22 %of prevalent cases (216, 716) included patients with prostate cancer, 18 % with bladder cancer, and 15 %with colon-rectum cancer. Percentages of long-term survivors higher than 70 % were reported for cancers of the cervix uteri (82 % at five years, and 55 % at 15 years from diagnosis), Hodgkin lymphoma, testis, brain and central nervous system, bone and connective tissue. Many patients with these types of cancers (often occurring in young people) can be considered "cured", i. e., with a life expectancy overlapping that of the general population. The estimated proportions of prevalent cases emerging from this study in Italy were quite similar to those reported in Northern Europe, but at least 15 %lower than those in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: in 2006, the number of prevalent cases nearly doubled compared to 1992. The increase over time in the proportion of elderly patients, related to population ageing, requires adequate health policies. Knowing the number of people alive many years after cancer diagnosis (either cured or long-term survivors) provides the scientific bases for the definition of health policies focusing on them. Furthermore, it promotes the conduction of studies aimed at improving the present knowledge on {{the quality of life of}} these patients during and after the active phase of treatments, in addition to studies on the long-term effects of treatments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the Chinese pharmaceutical policy in order to analyse the forms of effective market competition introduced or not in the system. Registration, pricing and trade are three areas showing the limits on competition. The government limits the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> procedure to three years, which leaves some opportunities for challengers to market similar products afterwards. The pricing system in place is a maximum price ceiling. The price structure reveals a net difference of treatment between foreign products and domestic products. With respect to trading policy, the government applies a selective licensing policy for exports and imposes variable custom taxes on a product-by-product basis on imports. At a micro level, the Chinese market has instant market conditions with fair trade where manufacturers, importers and distributors can meet. Different cost-sharing experiments between the state, the working units and the patients also introduce more sensitivity to prices from the consumer. Such a duality between the limits imposed on competition by public policy tools and the experiments or market conditions in place {{at the level of the}} organisations underlines the ambiguity of the move towards a market economy in the Chinese pharmaceutical market...|$|R
40|$|Arrhythmias {{are one of}} {{the most}} complex, insufficiently studied, and {{therefore}} one of the most urgent problems of modern cardiology. A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of cardiac rhythm disorders (CRDs), their detection both in various diseases and in healthy people, necessitate the study of their prevalence in populations. In the majority of conducted epidemiological studies a single recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) was used. This is the most usable method for examination of large populations but a little informative for detecting arrhythmias. The small frequency of CRDs detected during ECG recording is due to the short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> its <b>registration.</b> An increase in the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ECG recording (ECG recording for 2 minutes, continuous recording of 100 cardiocycles) leads to an increase in arrhythmias frequency. With a wide introduction in the practice of ECG monitoring by Holter as well as the use of individual recorders of electrocardiogram ("handheld ECG recording") data appeared indicating a much higher frequency of CRDs. Data obtained in numerous studies on the prevalence of arrhythmias are very contradictory and depend both on the characteristics of populations and on methodological approaches, which requires further epidemiological studies. At the same time, the main initiating point of such researches is the clinical significance of certain CRDs. However, if the clinical significance of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and atrial fibrillation does not currently cause any doubt, the clinical significance of extrasystoles is highly controversial, despite the high their prevalence, including this in prognostically unfavorable groups of patients. In recent years, the results of a number of studies have been published that allow to think about the adverse effects of both supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles of the course of certain cardiovascular diseases. Very heterogeneous results of the performed studies, as well as data about the high clinical significance of individual CRDs, make further epidemiological studies in this field extremely urgent. </p...|$|R

Based on the observations of practising conveyancers, it then proceeds to establish that typical transfers (transfers resulting from certain defined property transactions) should be registered within 6 to 12 weeks (42 to 84 days) from the date of sale. Some conveyancers prefer to express the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> transfers in months rather than weeks, and state that two to three months (60 to 90 days) represent a normal spectrum <b>of</b> <b>duration</b> for typical transfers. A model is then developed, based on PERT (Programme Evaluation and Review Techniques), that determines the minimum and maximum duration that could reasonably be expected with regard to typical transfers. These periods are calculated as 35 days and 97 days respectively. A reasonable, "average" period for typical transfers is calculated as 63 days. Based on the above findings, the study recommends a <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 60 to 70 days as a reasonable time span for typical transfers. This period constitutes a theoretical benchmark against which the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> typical transfers may be measured. The thesis then proceeds to calculate the real <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> typical transfers, based on information regarding transfers that had actually been registered in South African deeds offices over a period of seven years and ten months. With the aid of electronic data it is calculated that typical transfers take an average of 90. 15 days from conclusion of sale to date <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> The median <b>of</b> <b>duration</b> is determined as 85 days and the mode as 70 days. A ten day incrementalX analysis reflects the ten day category of 61 to 70 days as the category in which the most typical transfers occur. Certain trends regarding the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> transfers are established. Sectional title transfers are on average registered 1. 7 days faster than freehold transfers. A year-on-year comparison shows a reduction in the figure for average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> typical transfers during the years 1995 to 1999, but average duration increases substantially in 2000 and 2001. In some deeds registries transfers are on average registered faster than in others, but no relationship is found between the volume <b>of</b> <b>registrations</b> in a particular deeds office and the average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> these transfers. A relationship is found to exist, however, between the price bracket of a property and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the transfer. Broadly speaking it can be said that the higher the price, the shorter the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the transfer. At first glance it appears that, generally speaking, transfers actually take as long -or ·as short- as they are in theory supposed to take. Further analysis show, however, that a mere 35. 28 % of typical transfers are registered within 70 days or less. Only 54. 46 % of typical transfers take 90 days or less to register. The fact that so many actual registrations fail to meet the theoretical standards described in the study leads to tre conclusion that the unfavourable perception about the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> transfers has some merit. The thesis recommends that conveyancers use the findings of the study as management tools in the day to day management of their conveyancing practices. A follow- on study that addresses the unfavourable perception about the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> transfers in more detail is also recommended...|$|R

40|$|RADIATION EXPOSURE REDUCTION BY THE USE OF FLUOROSCOPIC NAVIGATION IN TRANSPEDICULAR INSTRUMENTATION OF THE LUMBAR SPINE SUMMARY The {{topic of}} this thesis is a {{comparison}} of radiation exposure during standard fluoroscopy and navigated transpedicular instrumentation of the lumbar spine, in compliance with standard techniques and accuracy of screw placement. Material and the Method: A group of 60 patients, divided into two equal groups, was statistically processed. In the first group 1. 9 lumbar spine segments were stabilized. The patients´ average age was 60. 8 years (from 35 to 75 years). Screws were inserted transpedicularly under the X-ray image intensifier navigation. In the second group stabilization of 1. 8 segments was performed on average. The average age was 61. 1 years (from 38 to 75 years). The screws were inserted postoperatively by using 2 D fluoroscopic navigation technique (VectorVision, BrainLAB, Germany). The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> skiascopy was collected from the X-ray image intensifier and recorded for each surgery (with navigation and without). The measured values were compared with each other. In both groups the screw positioning was checked continuously {{according to the rules}} defined by Learch, Acikbas and Whitecloud in the anteroposterior and lateral projection by meticulous pedicle palpation Results: The radiation exposure was calculated to one vertebra (2 screws) in both groups. In the second (navigated) group the radiation exposure time was significantly shorter (3. 4 s) than in the first (standard) group (14. 4 s). The mean <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> data <b>registration</b> was 6. 0 minutes (range 3 to 11 minutes). The mean ratio according to Acikbas's calculation method was 43. 2 % (range 32 % to 74 %) in the first group and 44. 1 % (range 35 % - 76 %) in the second group. The mean exposure dose of the first group was 243 ?G/m 2 and 138 ?G/m 2 in the second group. Exposition doses are smaller by 105 ?G/m 2 in the second group Conclusion: Based on the results, the hypothesis that navigation allows the same accuracy of pedicle screws insertion while reducing radiation exposure of the patients and the operating room staff to about ? can be confirmed. This reduction is more pronounced in multiple-level spinal stabilizations and in the centers for spinal surgeries, where numerous spinal instrumentations are performed every day...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Residents of {{long-term}} care facilities (LTCFs) colonized with multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) are often placed under contact isolation to ensure appropriate infection control. This isolation may reduce opportunities for rehabilitation and social stimuli and may also increase medical costs. However, the number of previous studies investigating the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> colonization in LTCFs is limited. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> colonization and risk factors for prolonged carriage of MDROs among residents of a LTCF. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a hospital-affiliated nursing home with 59 beds. Fifty-four residents in the nursing home were isolated for MDROs between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. Clinical data were collected from the charts of these 54 residents, including catheter use, colonizing MDRO species and site, underlying diseases, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and Barthel index scores before and after isolation. Forty-seven residents were included into the statistic analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed using <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> colonization as the dependent variable. Results The most frequently isolated MDROs were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (44. 7 %), and the median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> colonization was 72 (4 – 407) days. An increased CCI score significantly increased the risk of prolonged colonization (HR: 0. 86, 95 % CI: 0. 76 – 0. 98, p value 0. 02). Conclusion Among residents of the LTCF, the average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> MDRO colonization was approximately 3  months. CCI scores were positively associated with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the MDRO colonization of the LTCF residents. Further studies should be conducted to determine whether implementing isolation protocols for MDRO-colonized LTCF residents is associated with a decline in ADL. Trial registration The study protocol was approved by the National Center of Excellence for Clinical Trial and Research of the National Taiwan University Hospital (201512080 RINB).
