5|$|After {{the success}} of Hamasaki's January 1999 studio album A Song for ××, she began writing songs for her next studio album. However, <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label Avex Trax decided to release a remix album titled Ayu-mi-x. The record marked the {{beginning}} of the incorporation of music elements outside of her pop rock sound, including trance, house and electronic music. This transition into mainstream dance music made Hamasaki recruit new composers and producers for the then-upcoming studio album, including Japanese dance band HΛL, Do As Infinity member and composer Dai Nagao, and Kazuhito Kikuchi, amongst others.|$|E

Field received a Costume Design nomination as well. Neither won, but Blunt and Hathaway presented the last mentioned award, amusing the audience by slipping into their characters for a few lines, nervously asking which of them had gotten Streep her cappuccino. Streep played along with a stern expression before smiling.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Winehouse's {{spokesman}} {{reported that}} the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music. The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E
5|$|In the 1390s Jean Gerson of the University of Paris {{formed a}} council to {{eliminate}} the Western Schism, and in recognition of her negotiating skills he placed Isabeau on the council. The French wanted both the Avignon and Roman popes to abdicate {{in favor of a}} single papacy in Rome; Clement VII in Avignon welcomed Isabeau's presence given <b>her</b> <b>record</b> as an effective mediator. However, the effort faded when Clement VII died.|$|E

5|$|Mina fell in {{love with}} actor Corrado Pani in 1962. Their {{relationship}} shocked Italian audiences as he was already married although separated from his wife. Their son, , was born on 18 April 1963. Due to Mina's refusal to hide the relationship, the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels. As <b>her</b> <b>record</b> sales were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} nineteen, Trenyce {{was arrested}} for theft at work.

5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's {{presentation of}} a woman's view on life and love, along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label did not properly credit the group on the album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|Doro {{started her}} career in garage bands in native Düsseldorf {{underground}} scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have {{an opening in the}} US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rise}} of grunge and {{alternative}} rock in the 1990s, <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour {{all over the world}} and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, it was {{confirmed}} by Hamasaki and <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label Avex Trax that she would release a then-upcoming studio album titled Rock 'n' Roll Circus. Hamasaki and Avex Trax enlisted a long-term collaborator, Japanese businessman and producer Max Matsuura, to produce the album; this marked Hamasaki's eleventh consecutive album to be fully produced by Matsuura. Hamasaki began recording the album at Avex Studios and Prime Sound Studios in Japan around mid-2009 with Kōji Morimoto, Yūichi Nagayama, and Masashi Hashimoto. Hamasaki briefly moved to London, United Kingdom, to record the remaining material of the album with Dom Morley and Phill Brown. This marks Hamasaki's first album to have been recorded outside of Japan; she carried on recording her 2012 album Party Queen in London, which is her final album recorded in that region.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set {{the tone of the}} environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of <b>her</b> <b>record</b> producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E
5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain <b>her</b> <b>record.</b> Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E

5|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{arguing that}} it was an improvement on Jackson's two previous albums. Despite positive reviews it became one of her least successful albums. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming her sixth to top the chart and it was her first album to reach number one in the United States after 2001's All for You. However, sales of the album quickly fell, and by June the album's promotion had officially ended. Jackson started her Rock Witchu Tour—with the support of Live Nation—in early September to positive reviews {{but by the end of}} that month Jackson parted with <b>her</b> <b>record</b> label due to the album's commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her more attention than <b>her</b> <b>record</b> breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes {{and asked them to}} wear long shorts.|$|E
