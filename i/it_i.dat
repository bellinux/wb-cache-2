25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction.

Once I got into <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone.

I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> never did take a dollar of <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
