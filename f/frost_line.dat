5|$|While high {{metallicity}} {{is beneficial}} {{for the creation}} of terrestrial extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be harmful for life.

Thus, it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a new frosting map for air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) based on a temperature-humidity chart is reported in this paper. Through a parametric analysis, two boundary lines (a condensing <b>line</b> and a <b>frosting</b> <b>line)</b> were obtained, dividing the map into three regions: a non-frosting region, a condensing region and a frosting region. Using the simulation results from a generalized numerical model of frost growth, the frosting region was further divided into three indicative zones representing different frosting levels: a severe frosting zone, a moderate frosting zone (I, II) and a mild frosting zone (I, II). Lab and field tests were conducted in order to verify the correctness of the zoning and to obtain indicative defrosting intervals for ASHPs operated at different zones. Based on the test results and using the developed map, reference defrosting intervals were suggested for different frosting zones, and they can be used in conjunction with a conventional defrosting control method to avoid potential mal-defrosting.

5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} <b>frost</b> <b>line,</b> and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the <b>frost</b> <b>line,</b> the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E

25|$|A planet cannot have a hydrosphere—a key {{ingredient}} {{for the formation}} of carbon-based life—unless there is a source for water within its stellar system. The origin of water on Earth is still not completely understood; possible sources include the result of impacts with icy bodies, outgassing, mineralization, leakage from hydrous minerals from the lithosphere, and photolysis. For an extrasolar system, an icy body from beyond the <b>frost</b> <b>line</b> could migrate into the habitable zone of its star, creating an ocean planet with seas hundreds of kilometers deep such as GJ 1214 b or Kepler-22b may be.|$|E
500|$|The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, {{beyond the}} <b>frost</b> <b>line,</b> {{which is the}} point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the {{material}} is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the <b>frost</b> <b>line</b> accumulated up to [...] within about 3million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe {{it is no accident}} that Jupiter lies just beyond the <b>frost</b> <b>line.</b> Because the <b>frost</b> <b>line</b> accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the <b>frost</b> <b>line</b> acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate. [...] Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150Earth masses ~105years thereafter and finally topping out at [...] [...] Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.|$|E
500|$|The {{formation}} of giant planets {{is a more}} complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the <b>frost</b> <b>line,</b> where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear {{to continue to grow}} and eventually reach 5–10 Earth masses—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen–helium gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses (...) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Spring radiant frosts {{occurring}} when wheat is in reproductive developmental stages {{can result}} in catastrophic yield lost for producers. In wheat, heading time is the main determinant to minimize frost risks and to adapt new frost-tolerant cultivars to target population environments. Gene-based phenology models provide robust tools to predict heading times based on alleles of VRN and PPD genes, and have been widely validated across Australian wheatbelt for most of commercial wheat cultivars. A field experiment was conducted at Gatton in 2014 to calibrate the gene-based model for newly released cultivars. The results indicated that one field experiment including extended photoperiod and pre-vernalization treatments {{can be used to}} parameterize new cultivars and allow accurate prediction of heading time across all Australian environments using our gene-based model. Across Australia, we found that yield could be improved by up to 20 % on average if <b>frost</b> tolerant <b>lines</b> were available. The yield increase resulted from (1) reduced frost damage and (2) the ability to use earlier sowing dates.

40|$|AbstractSpring radiant frosts {{occurring}} when wheat is in reproductive developmental stages {{can result}} in catastrophic yield lost for producers. Yield potential is also reduced in areas where producers are obliged to sow late to avoid the peak frost risk period. To better understand the spatial and temporal variability of frost events, 0. 05 ° gridded weather datasets were used to calculate frost occurrence and frost impact on wheat production across the Australian wheat belt. Over the last 57 years, no significant trends in frost occurrence were observed {{in most of the}} Australian wheat belt. However, more frost events and later last frost days occurred in major parts of production areas while the opposite was rarely observed. Yield impact was simulated at 60 key locations using the Agricultural Production Simulation Model (APSIM) with a newly developed frost module. A significant increase in frost impact on yield was estimated in the higher-elevation areas of south eastern Australia in the states of Victoria and New South Wales. Across Australia, we found that yields could be improved by up to 20 % on average if <b>frost</b> tolerant <b>lines</b> were available. The yield increases resulted from (1) reduced frost damage and (2) the ability to use earlier sowing dates. Simulations suggest that a small reduction in the threshold temperatures, equivalent to frost tolerance of 1 °C lower than current cultivars would predicted a large effect on the occurrence of frost damage in the west of Australia. In the east, frost tolerance to lower temperatures (∼ − 4 °C) would be required to maximise the yield advantage. Thus despite global warming, breeding for improved reproductive frost tolerance remains a high priority for the Australian wheat industry...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cell lines}} of Eucalyptus gunnii {{have been shown}} to keep their {{differential}} frost tolerance at the cellular level after long-term culture. They have been used to investigate the fluidity of specific cell membranes in relation with frost tolerance. Protoplasts and isolated vacuoles were obtained from both cell lines. In addition, purified plasma membrane and tonoplast (the vacuolar membrane) were separated from a crude microsomal fraction through free-flow electrophoresis. The lateral and rotational mobilities of lipids in these different membranes were studied by two biophysical techniques: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence polarization. After labeling the vacuoles isolated from the frost-sensitive cells with 1 -oleoyl- 2 -(7 -nitro- 2, 1, 3 -benz-oxadiazol- 4 -yl) aminocaproyl phosphatidylcholine, a single mobile component was observed with a diffusion coefficient of 2. 4 × 10 − 9 cm 2 s− 1 and a mobile fraction close to 100 % at a temperature of 23 °C. When using isolated vacuoles from the <b>frost</b> tolerant <b>line,</b> a higher lateral diffusion of tonoplast lipids was found with a diffusion coefficient of 3. 2 × 10 − 9 cm 2 s− 1, still with a mobile fraction close to 100 %. No convincing data were obtained when performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments on protoplasts. Fluorescence polarization experiments confirmed the differential behavior of the two cell lines for tonoplast and also for plasma membrane. In addition, they showed that intrinsically tonoplast exhibited a higher fluidity than plasma membrane. Our results provide the first information on the fluidity of tonoplast and on the compared properties of two important plant membranes—tonoplast and plasma membrane—through the use of two complementary biophysical approaches. In addition, they suggest there is a correlation between membrane fluidity and cold tolerance. The potential interest of plant vacuole as a natural model system in membrane studies is emphasized...|$|R
