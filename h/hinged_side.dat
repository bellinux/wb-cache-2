500|$|Known as the Meiji 26 Nen Ken Ju (meaning [...] "Pistol, Pattern of the 26th {{year of the}} Meiji era"), the Type 26 {{revolver}} was {{the first}} indigenous revolver adopted by the Japanese military. The Type 26 was produced to replace the aging Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3 and was officially adopted March 29, 1894. The design is widely {{believed to be a}} mixture of features taken from other revolvers. The lock design is similar to Galand designs, the hinged frame is similar to Smith & Wesson designs, and the <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> plate covering the lock is similar to the Modèle 1892 revolver. The cartridge was loaded with black powder until 1900 when the cartridges began to be loaded with smokeless powder. The Type 26 is considered a remarkable leap in Japanese pistol development despite the international [...] influence, with the matchlock being the most common domestic Japanese handgun 40 years earlier. Production stopped after 1923 when much of the Koishikawa Arsenal was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, with assembly continuing until the exhaustion of stockpiled parts. Approximately 59,000 Type 26 revolvers were produced and an additional 900 revolvers were made in pre-production. Restoration and re-issue of revolvers that had been removed from service because of damage or wear, was carried out on an as needed basis over a period of many years. The original Type 26s are missing the external markings of later produced revolvers and are identifiable by numbers stamped on internal parts. Type 26s were still being used in 1945 which, according to firearms expert and author Ian Hogg, is considered a testament to their original workmanship and a much more suitable combat weapon than later Japanese produced pistols.|$|E

40|$|Background. One of the {{important}} complications of open-door laminoplasty is a premature laminoplasty closure. In order to prevent premature laminoplasty closure many techniques have been described and a titanium miniplate {{is one of the}} instruments to maintain cervical canal expansion. This study was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} titanium miniplates on the union rate for open-door laminoplasty. Materials and Methods. We performed open-door laminoplasty in 68 levels of fourteen patients using maxillofacial titanium miniplates. Axial computed tomography scans were obtained at 6 months postoperatively to evaluate the union rates of the <b>hinge</b> <b>side.</b> The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to compare the clinical outcomes before and after surgery. Results. Computed tomography scan data was available on 68 levels in 14 patients. There were no premature closures of the hinge or miniplate dislodgements. The union rate on the <b>hinge</b> <b>side</b> was 70. 5 % (48 / 68). The mean JOA score increased significantly from 7. 0 before surgery to 10. 2, 12. 2, and 13. 0 after surgery at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion. Open-door laminoplasty using maxillofacial titanium miniplates can provide union rates comparable to other techniques. It can maintain canal expansion without failures, dislodgements, and premature closures...|$|R

50|$|From their inception, {{eyeglasses}} posed {{a dilemma}} that wasn't solved for almost 350 years: {{how to keep}} them {{on the bridge of}} the nose without falling. Spanish spectacle makers of the 17th century experimented with ribbons of silk that could be attached to the frames and then looped over the ears. Spanish and Italian missionaries carried the new models to spectacle wearers in China. The Chinese attached little ceramic or metal weights to the strings instead of making loops. In 1730 a London optician named Edward Scarlett perfected the use of rigid sidepieces that rested atop the ears. This perfection rapidly spread across the continent.In 1752 James Ayscough publicized his latest invention, spectacles with double <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> pieces. These became very popular and appear more often than any other kind in paintings and prints of the period. Lenses were fabricated of tinted glass as well as clear. Ayscough felt that the clear glass lenses gave an unpleasant glare. In Spain in 1763 Pablo Minguet recommended turquoise, green, or yellow lenses but not amber or red.|$|E

5000|$|The Mark IV monorails {{were the}} first of the [...] "Learjet" [...] styled monorails used by Disney (long, sleek white trains with mid-level windows). The design was also used for the Mark V (Disneyland), Mark VI (WDW) and {{inspired}} the look of other systems such as the Las Vegas Monorail as well as systems in Asia. Each car featured brown interiors (seat material and carpet) with four double sided and two single (at the front and rear) bench seats which stretched the entire width of the car. The cars were accessed by doors which were automatically opened using a pneumatic system (a loud clunk would be heard and the doors would swing open at the press of a control button {{on the outside of the}} monorail near the driver door) and manually closed by a Cast Member who would walk from one end of the train to the other with his hand out, pushing the doors shut as he walked by). Unlike the current Mark VI trains in use at Disney World, Mark IV's were shorter, the cabins were somewhat narrower, and had no standing room capability. Although the trains were equipped with air conditioning and heating, to help with ventilation, each window could be cracked open with a latch. The pilot's compartments (cabs) were not heated. Passengers in wheel chairs were boarded in the middle door of the third car. The door included an opposite <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> that allowed the passenger to remain in their chair while boarding. Guests in chairs were boarded using a metal ramp (the floor of the train was several inches higher than that of the station) and one bench seat folded up allowing the chair to be anchored securely for travel without inconvenience to the guest.|$|E

5000|$|Eastern oysters {{can reach}} sexual {{maturity}} at four months old. The eastern oyster has a complex reproductive cycle. The cycle begins during {{late summer and}} autumn months with the storage of glycogen energy reserves. This glycogen is then used to support gametogenesis during the next winter and early spring when food intake is at a minimum. The gametes begin to mature in late spring and then, from June to August they are spawned into the water column, where fertilization occurs. Each female produces from 75 to 150 million eggs, but only one in 1000 survive. Then, fertilized eggs develop into planktonic, free-swimming, trochophore larvae, {{also known as the}} early umbo stage, which have cilia and a small shell, in about six hours. The trochophore larvae depend on their internal yolk supply for energy. They then develop into a fully shelled veliger larvae, also known as the late umbo stage, which have a <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> and a velum, formed within 12 to 24 hours. During this time, the shelled veliger larvae use their ciliated vela to capture food and swim. The larvae remain planktonic for about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on food and temperature conditions, and towards the end of this period, they develop into pediveliger larvae, also known as eyed larvae, which have an umbo, an eyespot, and a foot. During this time. the pediveliger larvae [...] "settle {{to the bottom of the}} water column where they seek a hard substrate". Ideally, the pediveliger larvae try to locate an adult oyster shell to which they attach, but other hard surfaces will suffice. Lastly, [...] "after careful selection of the proper attachment site, in or during relatively still water, the pediveliger larvae cement themselves to a firm clean surface and metamorphose to the adult form; these newly attached oysters are known as 'spat'". Upon being stimulated to settle, a larva cements its left valve to the substrate and metamorphoses into an oyster spat by discarding its velum, reabsorbing its foot, and enlarging its gills. During the first year of life, C. virginica oysters are protandric. Most spat are male, but once they reach sexual maturity, within four months in southern waters, some males change to females after the first or second spawning. Then, some females can even change back to males again.|$|E

It is vital that the telling {{of the story is}} not halted for scene changes — they must be swift. My advice is to keep it simple and rely heavily on lighting. A stone cross war memorial will suggest the village; a table, chairs and perhaps a dresser on an open stage [...] "closed-down" [...] with lighting is more than enough for the kitchen. The original production used a three-sided truck, one side of which was on hinges and could be opened. It was the <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> that contained within it the barn door — when this side of the truck was closed we were outside the barn and when it was open, inside the barn. The truck could also be wheeled round to show other sides for the Sunday School etcetera. The barn was collapsible so that it looked like a skeleton of rafters for the final scene, but there are simpler ways of convincing the audience of the fire — just strike the hay, props and agricultural paraphernalia you might be using as set dressing. For the big production numbers, which are set in a variety of simultaneous locations, use a lot of cues, bouncing at the appropriate moments from one area to another to define the street, the church, the Sunday school stage etcetera. [...] The young cast members must act and sing like real children caught up in a story they accept with a natural innocence and faith. Cathy must establish herself {{as the leader of the}} [...] "Disciples" [...] and must be an actress capable of the emotional outpourings at the end of the play. The Man should be an attractive actor with both charm and menace — he must be believable as both a murderer and Jesus Christ. [...] At no time in the play is the audience told, one way or the other, if The Man is the convict or Christ. Providing the [...] "Disciples" [...] are not too holy, knowing or artificial they will be convincing.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a 9 -storey Benchmark frame {{model was}} {{used to analyze the}} {{response}} of joints due to sudden column loss. On the basis of the substructure model, the static and dynamic nonlinear analyses were conducted seriatim using the alternative path method. It is found that the removals of the ground columns bring high-level joint moments and mild increasing of axial forces. In particular, the removal of side column with pin-ended connection results in the largest vertical displacement of adjacent joint and increase the flexural demands to the next joint. For this model, the most critical case appears at the failure of <b>hinged</b> <b>side</b> column, the next is the rigid side column...|$|E
