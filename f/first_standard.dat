5|$|By 1887 {{the threat}} of {{extinction}} was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> drawn {{up at the same}} time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further {{the best interests of the}} breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, New South Wales {{cattle farmer}} Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The {{resulting}} dogs {{were known as}} Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> for the breed, was influential in its development.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> {{nomenclature}} for Martian albedo features {{was introduced}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named La Planète Mars. The Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} {{the creation of}} Rovering in the U.S., J. S. Wilson travelled from the UK to oversee a Wood Badge course in May 1936 at Schiff. Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge. After World WarII, Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a test course begun on July 31, 1948, at Schiff and the <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> course at Philmont Scout Ranch. As the national director of training, Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads, a tradition that has been discontinued in the U.K. Scout Association, however other countries still continue {{the use of the}} five Wood Badge Beads and are still worn by the National Volunteer Leader of Wood Badge Training of each country as well as by special decree of Gilwell Park today.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>standard</b> strips {{began to}} emerge in the 1870s, with many clubs opting for colours {{associated}} with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged. Blackburn Rovers, for example, adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of Malvern College, one of the schools where the sport had developed. Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to reflect an association with Cambridge University, where a number of the club's founders had been educated. Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches, with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year. Rather than the modern shorts, players wore long knickerbockers or full-length trousers, often with a belt or even braces. Lord Kinnaird, an early star of the game, was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers. There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players, and the programme for an 1875 match between Queen's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings. The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson, who cut down a pair of cricket pads and wore them outside his stockings. Initially the concept was ridiculed but it soon caught on with other players. By {{the turn of the century}} pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings.|$|E

40|$|The <b>First</b> Four <b>Standards</b> {{deal with}} {{mathematical}} processes {{that apply to}} every topic in the mathematics curriculum. Students should always be improving their ability to solve problems, to communicate about mathematics, to make connections within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects, and to reason mathematically. Although the <b>First</b> Four <b>Standards</b> are conceptually separate, in practice they are interwoven. For example, when students are working in groups to solve a mathematics problem that may have arisen in another area, they use communication to explain their solution strategies and reasoning to justify their conclusions. The inter-relation of the <b>First</b> Four <b>Standards</b> {{is reflected in the}} graphic that appears above and elsewhere in this chapter. This Framework therefore discusses the <b>First</b> Four <b>Standards</b> in a single chapter.
