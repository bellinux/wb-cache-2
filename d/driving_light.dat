2500|$|Mallow Racecourse, {{now known}} as Cork Racecourse, became an {{emergency}} airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000ft) in length which was {{paid for by the}} plane's insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later, whereas in the meantime Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, the Captain said his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. [...] The runway was subsequently utilised for parking during race meets and was a popular facility for learner <b>driving.</b> <b>Light</b> aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area. The F3A World Model Aircraft Aerobatic Championship was held there in 2001. The 1983 incident formed the basis of the 2010 film The Runway.|$|E

50|$|Blackout Driving Lights {{are mounted}} on the driver's side of the vehicle, {{typically}} on the fender or grille. They give off a diffused {{beam of white light}} that takes the place of regular headlights when driving under blackout conditions. It is intended to give off enough light for the driver to make his way. The Blackout <b>Driving</b> <b>Light</b> is also hooded making the light only {{to be able to be}} seen when looking up at it. With the use of night vision goggles the effectiveness of the blackout <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> can be increased.|$|E
5000|$|Another, at {{the time}} minor, {{distinctive}} feature but this one did not catch-on was the centrally mounted light in the grille where most other manufacturers of good quality cars provided a pair, one fog and one <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> often separately mounted behind the bumper. Known, unkindly, as the [...] "Cyclops eye" [...] it was discontinued in the new grille announced 23 October 1952.|$|E
50|$|In {{medium to}} high loads, the DC {{resistance}} of buck converter switching elements tends {{to dominate the}} overall efficiency of the Buck Converter. When <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> loads, however, the effects of DC resistances are reduced and AC losses in the inductor, capacitor, and switching elements play {{a larger role in}} overall efficiency. This is especially true in discontinuous mode operation, in which the inductor current drops below zero, resulting in the discharging of the output capacitor and even higher switching losses.|$|E

5000|$|A GS Rally Pack {{was fitted}} as {{standard}} equipment on the Falcon GS Hardtop [...] and was available as an option on Falcon 500 Sedan and Wagon, Fairmont Sedan and Wagon, Falcon Utility and Van [...] and on Falcon 500 Utility and Van. The pack included special paint treatment, bonnet scoops, bumper overriders, slotted steel wheels, enhanced instrumentation, a sports steering wheel and long range <b>driving</b> <b>lights.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> were not included when the pack was fitted to Fairmont models.|$|R
5000|$|The terms harness {{horse and}} light harness horse refer to horses of a lighter build, such as {{traditional}} carriage horses and show horses, {{and are not}} terms generally used to denote [...] "heavy" [...] or draft horses. Harness horse breeds include heavy warmblood breeds such as the Oldenburg and Cleveland Bay, as well as lighter breeds such as the Hackney, and in some disciplines, such as combined <b>driving,</b> <b>light</b> riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred or Morgan may be seen.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{equipped}} with an IR <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> and an IR searchlight. The searchlight {{was removed from the}} right side of the front of the superstructure, as the area there was used for the second projecting bay. It was instead fitted on the commander's cupola. It also has two mounts for shovels on either side of the front of the vehicle as well as two mounts for pickaxes on the left side of the superstructure. A stowage bucket is placed centrally in the front of the engine deck.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bell and}} {{the whistle on}} the boiler are {{believed}} to have been donated by the Monon Railroad shops in Lafayette. The whistle used exhaust from the engine as its source of compressed gas. Although the cab had marker lights, the only <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> was the single 'cyclops' light mounted high {{on the front of the}} boiler. Due to the high placement of the single headlight and a minimal number of other exterior lights, Boilermaker Special I was not driven at night for safety reasons. In honor of the Purdue students and alumni who contributed to the project, the numbers [...] "074041" [...] were later installed in the sides of the headlight.|$|E
5000|$|Its armor is {{composed}} of homogeneous, cold rolled, welded steel—it is very thin by modern standards, 13 mm at the front, 10 mm on the sides and top and 7 mm at the rear. While its maximum armor protects it fully against small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments, it cannot protect it against large shell fragments and [...]50-caliber machine gun bullets. Although its front armor might protect it against 7.62 mm small arms fire, that same fire can sometimes penetrate the sides. The vehicle is equipped with an IR <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> and an IR searchlight. It lags behind other Soviet armored fighting vehicles as it has no fire protection systems and, {{with the exception of}} the BTR-50PK variant, it has no nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) protection systems, which significantly reduces its effectiveness[...]|$|E

5000|$|This {{version of}} the 2015 Dodge Challenger with a {{supercharged}} 6.2-liter HEMI engine is rated at [...] and 650 lbft Nm of torque. This engine is also available in the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. The inner <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> on the left front has been removed to allow air {{to get into the}} engine resulting in more torque, and the wheel wells are different from the standard SRT to accommodate the 20-inch aluminum wheels. The SRT Hellcat is equipped with two separate key fobs; use of the [...] "black" [...] fob limits engine output to , while the [...] "red" [...] fob enables full output capability. The Hellcat has a quarter mile time of 10.85 seconds; this was accomplished with street legal drag tires. On stock tires the Hellcat was able to achieve 11.2 seconds @ 125 mph on the quarter mile.|$|E

5000|$|Photoluminescence {{processes}} can {{be classified}} by various parameters such as {{the energy of the}} exciting photon with respect to the emission.Resonant excitation describes a situation in which photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed and equivalent photons are very rapidly re-emitted. This {{is often referred to as}} resonance fluorescence. For materials in solution or in the gas phase, this process involves electrons but no significant internal energy transitions involving molecular features of the chemical substance between absorption and emission. In crystalline inorganic semiconductors where an electronic band structure is formed, secondary emission can be more complicated as events may contain both coherent contributions such as resonant Rayleigh scattering where a fixed phase relation with the <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> field is maintained (i.e. energetically elastic processes where no losses are involved), and incoherent contributions (or inelastic modes where some energy channels into an auxiliary loss mode), ...|$|E

40|$|The group {{velocity}} of the probe light pulse (GVPLP) propagating through an open Lambda-type atomic system with a spontaneously generated coherence is investigated when the weak probe and strong <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> fields have different frequencies. It is found that adjusting the detuning or Rabi frequency of the probe light field can realize switching of the GVPLP from subluminal to superluminal. Changing the relative phase between the probe and <b>driving</b> <b>light.</b> elds or atomic exit and injection rates can lead to GVPLP varying in a wider range, but cannot induce transformation of {{the property of the}} GVPLP. The absolute value of the GVPLP always increases with Rabi frequency of the <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> field increasing. For subluminal and superluminal propagation, the system always exhibits the probe absorption, and GVPLP is mainly determined by the slope of the steep dispersion...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the response of}} a polariton laser driven slightly off-resonantly using light fields differing from the routinely studied coherent pump sources. The response to <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> fields with thermal and displaced thermal statistics with varying correlation times shows {{significant differences in the}} transmitted intensity, its noise, and the position of the nonlinear threshold. We predict that adding more photons on average may actually reduce the transmission through the polariton system...|$|E
40|$|In a Joint Center paper, Kleit and Lutter {{identify}} externalities {{of about}} $ 0. 08 per mile for <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicles. Rather than recognize the huge externalities from current driving, {{they focus on}} a tiny increment that would come from increasing CAFE standards. A first best policy would tax congestion, pollution emissions and gasoline, and increase safety. If that policy is not politically feasible, a second best policy would increase gasoline taxes $ 1. 75 per gallon. Contrary to Kleit and Lutter, we find sound economic reasons for CAFE. ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the Rekord C was the Rekord Sprint coupé (1967-71) with <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> sport steel wheels, sport stripes and a sporty interior; the Sprint received exclusively the so-called 1900 H engine with two double-barrel carburettors, good for [...] and 108 mi/h km/h.|$|R
